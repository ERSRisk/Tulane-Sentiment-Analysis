U.S.-backed aid group in Gaza reopens sites after closures and delays,https://www.nbcnews.com/world/gaza/us-backed-aid-group-gaza-reopens-sites-closures-delays-israel-rcna211160,"Thu, 05 Jun 2025 13:57:52 GMT",A U.S. and Israeli-backed aid organization in Gaza said it was reopening two distribution sites a day after shutting them following deadly shootings.,"A U.S. and Israeli-backed organization distributing aid in Gaza said Thursday it was reopening two distribution sites a day after shutting them following a series of deadly shootings close to its operations.
The U.S.-based Gaza Humanitarian Foundation said only two sites in southern Gaza’s Rafah area would operate Thursday, after all sites were closed the day before for maintenance. GHF had opened three sites earlier in the week, and one of Thursday’s sites was in a new location, it said.
The GHF, which has been fiercely criticized by humanitarian organizations including the United Nations for alleged lack of neutrality, began distributing aid last week. The U.N. has warned that most of Gaza’s 2.3 million population is at risk of famine after an 11-week Israeli blockade of the enclave.
Meanwhile, Israel announced it had recovered the bodies of two dual nationality Israeli-American hostages from Gaza. Gadi Hagi and his wife Judy Weinstein-Hagi were killed and taken to Gaza after Hamas’ October 7, 2023 attack that triggered the war. Fifty-six hostages remain in captivity, with fewer than half believed to be alive.
The Israeli military has intensified operations in Gaza since breaking a fragile ceasefire with Hamas in March, taking more territory with the government pushing to wipe out the Islamist militant group.
At least 20 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes across Gaza on Thursday, including four journalists in a hospital in the enclave’s north, local health authorities said. The military said that it had targeted an Islamic Jihad militant who was operating a command-and-control center.
The Hamas-run government media office says that 225 journalists in Gaza have been killed since the war began.
The renewed military campaign has further isolated Israel amid mounting international pressure. On Wednesday, a U.S. veto blocked a U.N. Security Council draft resolution, backed by the 14 other members, demanding an “immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire” and full, unrestricted aid access to Gaza.
Under global pressure, Israel allowed limited U.N.-led aid deliveries to resume on May 19. A week later, the relatively unknown GHF launched a new aid distribution system that bypasses traditional relief agencies.
The GHF halted distributions on Wednesday and said it was pressing Israeli forces to improve civilian safety beyond the perimeter of its operations after dozens of Palestinians were shot dead near the Rafah site over three consecutive days this week.
What exactly occurred remains unclear, but the Israeli military said its soldiers fired warning shots in each incident. GHF has said that aid was safely handed out from its sites without any incident.
The American organization, which uses private U.S. security and logistics companies to transport aid to its distribution points inside Gaza from where it is collected, has said that it has so far distributed at least 7 million meals.
The U.N. and international humanitarian groups refuse to work with the GHF because they say aid distribution is essentially controlled by Israel’s military and forces the displacement of Palestinians by limiting distribution points to a few venues in central and southern Gaza.
Navigating the Gaza Strip is dangerous, with unexploded rockets and shells making it hard for many to reach aid handout sites. For Palestinians in north Gaza, cut off from distribution points in the south, even that remains out of reach.
Footage released by the GHF this week showed hundreds of Palestinians crowding its site in Rafah, collecting aid from piles of stacked boxes without any clear system of distribution.
Muslims around the world will begin celebrating Eid al Adha from Thursday, a holiday typically marked by slaughtering livestock, but in Gaza food is scarce after nearly two years of war and Israeli siege.
Israeli opposition lawmaker Avigdor Lieberman accused the government on Thursday of arming Palestinian militias in Gaza.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said later in a statement that Israel was acting “in various ways” on the recommendation of the security establishment.
Netanyahu’s office did not deny Lieberman’s accusation.
Israeli media reported that Israel had transferred weapons to Yasser Abu Shabab, a leader of a large clan in the Rafah area, now under full Israeli army control.
Abu Shabab previously said that he was building up a force to secure aid deliveries into some parts of Gaza.
Hamas security officials told Reuters Abu Shabab was wanted for “collaborating with the occupation against his people”. They said Hamas forces had killed at least two dozen of his men before January in what they said were clashes with looters of aid trucks.
Israel has long accused Hamas of stealing aid, which the group denies. On Wednesday, a Palestinian transport company contracted by U.N. agencies suspended operations indefinitely after an armed gang intercepted its aid trucks in Deir Al-Balah, central Gaza, killing one driver and injuring another.
Israel and the U.S. are urging the U.N. and governments to work through the GHF. But it is unclear who is funding the group, which this week named an evangelical Christian with ties to U.S. President Donald Trump as its executive chairman.
The war in Gaza has raged since Hamas-led militants killed 1,200 people in Israel in the October2023 attack and took 251 hostages back to the enclave, according to Israeli tallies.

CSX rebounds from service problems and sluggish operations,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/csx-rebounds-problems-sluggish-operations-134014251.html,2025-06-05T13:40:14Z,,"CSX has fully bounced back from a bout of operational challenges that began with hurricanes last fall and worsened after the Feb. 1 closure of the Howard Street Tunnel in Baltimore, CEO Joe Hinrichs tells Trains.
The railroad’s on-time performance in May, measured by trip plan compliance for intermodal and carload shipments, has returned to December levels.
“I’ve learned enough from Mother Nature to never call the all clear. But we feel really good about the state of our railroad right now,” Hinrichs said in an interview on Wednesday. “The yards are in good shape. The network is performing back to where it was in ’23. And so the team’s done a great job … quickly getting the network back.”
CSX (NASDAQ: CSX) was already struggling operationally when it shut down the Howard Street Tunnel for a six-to-eight-month double-stack clearance project. This forced the railroad to detour more than 16 trains per day. The tunnel is a key link in both the north-south Interstate 95 Corridor and the east-west corridor that connects Baltimore with the Midwest and with coal mines in West Virginia and Pennsylvania.
By the first week in April, the CSX network had slowed to levels not seen since the 2022 service crisis caused by widespread crew shortages at all four big U.S. railroads.
The latest performance metrics, released Wednesday, tell the story of how CSX turned its operations around over the past seven weeks:
Terminal dwell has improved 20.2% compared to the worst week this year.
Average train velocity is running 15.4% above the lowest level posted this year.
The number of cars online, a key indication of congestion, has decreased 11.7% compared with this year’s high point.
And CSX is running faster than last year at this time, too. Last week’s dwell was 5.9% lower than the same week last year, while velocity was 3.4% higher.
As a result, combined trip plan compliance for intermodal and carload traffic stood at 82.5% in May – up from 68.1% in early April and in line with December 2024’s 82.7%.
The number of cars online is currently 0.7% higher than a year ago. But that figure reflects extended transit times related to detouring traffic around the Howard Street Tunnel and the out-of-service Blue Ridge Subdivision, which has been closed since September due to extensive damage from Hurricane Helene.
The recovery came faster than initially expected. Executives had said service improvements wouldn’t come overnight and that the Howard Street and Blue Ridge Sub detours would continue to weigh on the railroad until the projects are completed in the fall.
“I’m proud of the team, but I’m not surprised because I know the capability of this organization,” Hinrichs said.
Hinrichs says he also wasn’t surprised by the fragility of the network given a string of unusual events. Sixty miles of the Blue Ridge Sub — the former Clinchfield Railroad on the rugged North Carolina-Tennessee border — were wiped off the map in September. Hurricane Milton struck the Southeast right on the heels of Hurricane Helene. Midwestern yards were congested when CSX shut down the Howard Street Tunnel. And then recovery efforts were complicated by spring flooding that hit Kentucky and Tennessee.
“In hindsight, we should have made sure that those yards were in better shape before we took the Howard Street Tunnel down,” Hinrichs said.
“I don’t expect we’ll have that kind of sequence of events happen again, but we did learn some lessons. Clearly, we’ve got to keep our yards in great shape. And we have to make sure that we stick to our … service plans, because therein lies our success.”
If there is another weather-related disruption, Hinrichs says CSX will be better prepared to respond because the network is running well.
“We’re in good shape now and, obviously, our plan and our goal is to keep it running there. What’s encouraging is we’re getting to these levels before we get the Blue Ridge and Howard Street Tunnel back. So we run like this now and we get those two … projects completed, we’re going to be even in better shape.”
CSX’s operational problems followed a familiar pattern: As a railroad slows down and gets congested, it eventually runs into crew and locomotive shortages, which makes it harder to run to the operating plan — much less clear congestion. And when transit times rise, customers add cars to the system, which further snarls operations.
But what made CSX’s 2025 meltdown unusual was that it was not accompanied by a wave of customer complaints.
Hinrichs credits this to proactive communication with shippers and close coordination between customer service and operations. The customer service team asked customers to prioritize their shipments. The information was then passed along to operations, which put an emphasis on moving the hot cars. In some instances, CSX trucked containers and trailers around rail congestion so that they would arrive on time.
“We did a number of extraordinary things to keep our service focused on our customers and to respond to customer needs,” Hinrichs said. “And so what we found really important to customers was visibility and proactive communication. And I think that’s why you didn’t hear a lot of complaints.”
CSX took several steps to clear congestion. Among them: pulling 45 locomotives from storage, ordering 20 additional locomotive rebuilds, adjusting engineering work blocks to align with natural lulls in traffic, storing 2,000 cars, and collaborating with customers and shortline railroads to pre-block traffic and increase the frequency of interchanges.
Hinrichs says the railroad was adequately staffed on the routes that have had to shoulder the burden of the Howard Street Tunnel and Blue Ridge Sub detours, which account for about 12% of the railroad’s daily train starts. But crew supply got tight once congestion put crews and locomotives out of position.
To boost crew levels, the railroad temporarily transferred crews to 13 locations and consolidated extra boards at eight locations. Hinrichs also made two appeals to train crews and other employees to make themselves available, particularly on weekends, to help get traffic moving.
Did those bulletins make an impact? “I’ll just say I’m really proud of how our team responded. I believe in treating all of our 23,000 railroaders as equals and I felt they needed to know what was happening and what help was needed and where we needed additional help. And they responded,” Hinrichs said.
Independent analyst Anthony B. Hatch says CSX did a remarkable job turning its operations around. To please customers, the railroad has been absorbing the extra costs related to the detours. “So CSX is taking the hit, not shippers,” Hatch said.

Harvard Challenges Trump's Ban On Incoming Foreign Students In New Legal Filing,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ap-us-trump-harvard_n_68421da8e4b0bc3cc18f9610,"Thu, 05 Jun 2025 18:46:09 -0400",The Ivy League school called the latest action by the Trump administration illegal retaliation for Harvard’s rejection of White House demands.,"Harvard University is challenging President Donald Trump’s move to block foreign students from coming to the United States to attend the Ivy League school, calling it illegal retaliation for Harvard’s rejection of White House demands.
In an amended complaint filed Thursday, Harvard called the president’s action an end-run around a previous court order. Last month, a federal judge blocked the Department of Homeland Security from revoking Harvard’s ability to host foreign students.
The filing attacks Trump’s legal justification for the action — a federal law allowing him to block a “class of aliens” deemed detrimental to the nation’s interests. Targeting only those who are coming to the U.S. to study at Harvard doesn’t qualify as a “class of aliens,” Harvard said in its filing.
“The President’s actions thus are not undertaken to protect the ‘interests of the United States,’ but instead to pursue a government vendetta against Harvard,” the university wrote.
The amended complaint came in a lawsuit filed last month challenging the previous action from Homeland Security. A federal judge in Boston blocked the move after Harvard said it violated the school’s First Amendment rights. The new filing asks the same judge to block Trump’s latest action too.
If Trump’s measure stands, it would block thousands of students who are scheduled to come to the campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts, for summer and fall terms.
“Harvard’s more than 7,000 F-1 and J-1 visa holders — and their dependents — have become pawns in the government’s escalating campaign of retaliation,” Harvard wrote.
THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.
Winning admission to Harvard University fulfilled a longtime goal for Yonas Nuguse, a student in Ethiopia who endured the Tigray conflict, internet and phone shutdowns, and the COVID-19 pandemic — all of which made it impossible to finish high school on time.
Now, it’s unclear if he will make it this fall to the Ivy League campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He and other admitted students around the world are anxiously tracking the school’s feud with the Trump administration, which is seeking to keep it from enrolling international students.
The war in the country’s Tigray region forced schools to close in many parts of the province. Nuguse, 21, took a gap year to study and save money to pay for his TOEFL English proficiency test in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia’s capital.
“The war affected me a great deal and when I found out the news that I was accepted to Harvard, I was ecstatic. I knew it was a proud moment for my family, teachers, mentors and friends, who were instrumental in my achievement,” he said.
Increasingly, the nation’s oldest and best-known university has attracted some of the brightest minds from around the world, with international students accounting for one-quarter of its enrollment. As Harvard’s fight with the administration plays out, foreign students are now navigating deep uncertainty and weighing other options.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump signed a directive seeking to block U.S. entry for Harvard’s international students. It marked the administration’s latest effort to squeeze Harvard’s foreign enrollment after a federal judge in Boston blocked the withdrawal of its certification to host students from overseas.
“Harvard will continue to protect its international students,” the university said in a statement.
The standoff with Harvard comes as the administration has been tightening scrutiny of student visas nationwide. Thousands of students around the country abruptly lost permission to be in the U.S. this spring before the administration reversed itself, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced last week the U.S. would “aggressively revoke” visas for students from China.
“It is one blow after another,” said Mike Henniger, CEO of Illume Student Advisory Services, who works with colleges in the U.S., Canada and Europe to recruit international students. “At this point, international student interest in the U.S. has basically dropped to nil.”
The future of Harvard’s international students has been hanging in the balance since the Department of Homeland Security first moved to block its foreign enrollment on May 22.
For many, the twists and turns have been exhausting. Jing, a 23-year-old master’s student, is currently completing an internship in China this summer, and unsure if he can reenter the U.S. for the fall semester.
“It is tiring, we all feel numb now. Trump just makes big news headlines once every few days since he got back to the White House,” said Jing, who agreed to speak under his family name out of concern about retaliation from the Trump administration.
Jing said he is going to watch and see what happens for now, in case the move against international students is a negotiating tactic that does not stick.
The possibility that Trump could block foreign enrollment at other colleges only raises the uncertainty for students planning to pursue their education overseas, said Craig Riggs, who has been working in international education for about 30 years and is the editor of ICEF Monitor. He said he urges families to consult carefully with advisers and not to overreact to the day’s headlines.
“The rules under which students would make this huge decision to devote years of their lives and quite a bit of money to studying at Harvard have been shown to change quite quickly,” Riggs said.
An aspiring economist, Nuguse was the only student accepted to Harvard this year from Kalamino Special High School, which caters to gifted students from underprivileged backgrounds from across Tigray.
After receiving acceptances also to Columbia University and Amherst College, Nuguse chose Harvard, which he had long dreamed of attending. He said he hopes it will work out to attend Harvard.
Nuguse was granted a visa to study at Harvard, and he worries it might be too late to reverse his decision and attend another university anyway. He received an email from Harvard last week, telling him to proceed with his registration and highlighting a judge’s order in Harvard’s favor in the dispute over foreign enrollment.
“I hope the situation is temporary and I can enroll on time to go on and realize my dream far from reality in Ethiopia,” he said.

Republicans dangle pay raise to physicians — if they stay quiet on Medicaid cuts
Lawmakers have begun lobbying the lobbyists: asking health care interests to keep quiet — or speak up — about potential cuts to Medicaid, which will put 10.9 million people at risk of losing health insurance.
Republicans have urged doctor groups to hold back on criticisms of the cuts, pointing out the inclusion of an enticing carrot for doctors groups in President Trump’s tax bill: Pay increases for physicians from Medicare. Increasing the amount that Medicare pays doctors — especially over the long-term, tied to inflation — has been a top priority for physicians groups in Washington for years. Conversely, Democrats are asking lobbyists to put Republicans on blast for how these cuts would affect providers and patients, but the party lacks leverage as Republicans can pass the measure without Democratic lawmakers. STAT’s Daniel Payne has the scoop.
As Congress bats around ideas for slashing Medicaid spending, more than half of Americans are fretting that the reductions would impair their family’s ability to obtain and afford health care, according to a new poll from KFF Health Tracking Poll. The fear extends to Republican voters, too, including 76% of MAGA supporters and other Republican Medicaid enrollees.
NIH, FDA diverge on AI strategy
It looks like the NIH is thinking about AI differently than the FDA, who earlier this week released a “rushed” AI tool across the agency. At the Coalition for Health AI summit at Stanford University yesterday, NIH principal deputy director Matthew Memoli announced a request for public input on the agency’s AI strategy. The NIH, he said, sees AI as being an integral part of scientific research going forward — especially as datasets for research swell in size. The request seeks suggestions on how the NIH can use AI to make its functions more useful and how it can foster trust and transparency in using and evaluating AI tools for applications ranging from clinical AI tools to peer review.
The agency plans to name a new chief AI officer as well — STAT noticed yesterday that the NIH’s inaugural chief AI officer, Gil Alterovitz, has already stepped down and returned to the Veterans Health Agency, where he is also chief AI officer, according to his LinkedIn. It’s a bit surprising that the NIH made such an announcement at an event for the health AI nonprofit, as four House Republicans last year sent letters to federal officials criticizing the government’s relationship to CHAI, resulting in Biden officials stepping down from the CHAI board. – Brittany Trang

Move over, Francis Galton
Americans’ self-reported race is a poor proxy for their genetic ancestry, according to a large government study published Thursday that could have major implications for how health disparities are researched.
Writing in the American Journal of Human Genetics, researchers analyzed the genomes of more than 200,000 participants in the All of Us cohort, which was established by the National Institutes of Health to create a dataset that accurately represented the makeup of the United States. The study arrives amid a heated debate over the role racial categories play in research as the Trump administration has targeted grants it deems related to “diversity, equity, and inclusion” as being “unscientific.”
“The clear message here is that these are two distinct constructs, they mean different things, and they should not be used interchangeably,” said Luisa Borrell, a social epidemiologist at the CUNY School of Public Health. STAT’s Anil Oza dives deep into the study and the fraught history between geneticists and the idea of race.
GLP-1 drugs linked to elevated risk of eye disease
People with diabetes taking GLP-1 drugs had a low but elevated risk of an age-related eye disease that can sometimes lead to blindness, a new observational study concludes.
The research, published Thursday in JAMA Ophthalmology, found that after one year, more than twice as many people on GLP-1 drugs developed neovascular age-related macular degeneration compared to similar people who were not taking the drugs. The risk was 0.2% in people taking GLP-1s and 0.1% in those who didn’t.
Famous for their success in helping people lose weight, GLP-1 drugs were originally intended to control their blood sugar. But as their use has exploded, various eye problems have been reported, including abnormal blood vessel growth. STAT’s Elizabeth Cooney has more about these powerful medications and their possible side effects.
Sadly, Red Bull does not give you wings
To the dismay of line cooks and bodybuilders everywhere, a new report found that taurine — an amino acid abundant in plants, animals and energy drinks — was found to be an unreliable biomarker for aging.
Taurine has long been a darling of longevity seekers, but results published Thursday have cast doubt on a 2023 study that made the amino acid a staple ingredient for biohackers searching for anti-aging elements (a la tech mogul Bryan Johnson). The new study data showed that taurine rises with age, pulling data from 32 monkeys, 39 mice, one cohort of 742 humans, one cohort of 159 humans, and another cohort of 72 humans.
The data are a reminder of just how messy and complicated longevity studies can be, and how elusive treatments, or even just reliable markers, for aging remain. STAT’s Jason Mast has the study’s full readout.
At-home sexual assault kits come with legal, health risks
The Food and Drug Administration recently approved the first at-home cervical cancer screening test in May, marking a significant shift toward accessible, patient-driven health care. But the agency’s decision may revive the debate over at-home sexual assault kits, at a time when states and companies selling these kits are battling over their legality, writes Rachell Ekroos, a forensic nursing expert.
The concept of at-home sexual assault evidence collection kits emerged in the late 2010s at the height of the “Me Too” movement, when companies began offering them as a way to empower survivors to collect forensic evidence privately and on their own terms. But a legal fight over their accuracy soon emerged, and advocacy groups worried about the lack of oversight, quality control, and linkage to support options for the survivor. To understand why Ekroos is worried that the newly approved at-home cervical screening tests will revive the movement for at-home sexual assault kits, read on.

Still haven't filed your taxes? Here's what you need to know,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/13/success/tax-filing-tips/index.html,"Fri, 14 Apr 2023 20:07:40 GMT","So far this tax season, the IRS has received more than 90 million income tax returns for 2022.","So far this tax season, the IRS has received more than 100 million income tax returns for 2022.
That means tens of millions of households have yet to file their returns. If yours is among them, here are some last-minute tax-filing tips to keep in mind as the Tuesday, April 18 deadline approaches.
Not everyone has to file on April 18: If you live in a federally declared disaster area, have a business there — or have relevant tax documents stored by businesses in that area — it’s likely the IRS has already extended the filing and payment deadlines for you. Here is where you can find the specific extension dates for each disaster area.
Thanks to many rounds of extreme weather in recent months, for instance, tax filers in most of California — which accounts for 10% to 15% of all federal filers — have already been granted an extension until Oct. 16 to file and to pay, according to an IRS spokesperson.
If you’re in the armed forces and are currently or were recently stationed in a combat zone, the filing and payment deadlines for your 2022 taxes are most likely extended by 180 days. But your specific extended filing and payment deadlines will depend on the day you leave (or left) the combat zone. This IRS publication offers more detail.
Lastly, if you made little to no money last year (typically less than $12,950 for single filers and $25,900 for married couples), you may not be required to file a return. But you may want to anyway if you think you are eligible for a refund thanks to, for instance, refundable tax credits such as the Earned Income Tax Credit. (Use this IRS tool to gauge whether you are required to file this year.) You also are likely eligible to use IRS Free File (intended for those with adjusted gross income of $73,000 or less) so it won’t cost you to submit a return.
Your paycheck may not be your only source of income: If you had one full-time job you may think that is the only income you made and have to report. But that’s not necessarily so.
Other potentially taxable and reportable income sources include:
- Interest on your savings
- Investment income (e.g., dividends and capital gains)
- Pay for part-time or seasonal work, or a side hustle
- Unemployment income
- Social Security benefits or distribution from a retirement account
- Tips
- Gambling winnings
- Income from a rental property you own
Organize your tax documents: By now you should have received every tax document that third parties are required to send you (your employer, bank, brokerage, etc.).
If you don’t recall receiving a hard copy of a tax form in the mail, check your email and your online accounts — a document may have been sent to you electronically.
Here are some of the tax forms you may have received:
- W-2 from your wage or salaried jobs
- 1099-B for capital gains and losses on your investments
- 1099-DIV from your brokerage or company where you own stock for dividends or other distributions from their investments
- 1099-INT for interest over $10 on your savings at a financial institution
- 1099-NEC from your clients, if you worked as a contractor
- 1099-K for payments for goods and services through third-party platforms like Venmo, CashApp or Etsy. The 1099-K is required if you made more than $20,000 in over 200 transactions during the year. (Next year the reporting threshold drops to $600.) But even if you didn’t get a 1099-K you still must report all the income that you made over third-party platforms in 2022.
- 1099-Rs for distributions over $10 that you received for a pension, annuity, retirement account, profit-sharing plan or insurance contract
- SSA-1099 or SSA-1042S for Social Security benefits received.
“Be aware that there’s no form for some taxable income, like proceeds from renting out your vacation property, meaning you’re responsible for reporting it on your own,” according to the Illinois CPA Society.
One very last-minute way to reduce your 2022 tax bill: If you’re eligible to make a tax-deductible contribution to an IRA and haven’t done so for last year, you have until April 18 to contribute up to $6,000 ($7,000 if you’re 50 or older). That will reduce your tax bill and augment your retirement savings.
Proofread your return before submitting it: Do this whether you’re using tax software or working with a professional tax preparer.
Little mistakes and oversights delay the processing of your return (and the issuance of your refund if you’re owed one). You want to avoid things like having a typo in your name, birth date, Social Security number or direct deposit number; choosing the wrong filing status (e.g., married vs single); making a simple math error; or leaving a required field blank.
What to do if you can’t file by April 18: If you’re not able to file by next Tuesday, fill out Form 4868 electronically or on paper and send it in by April 18. You will be granted an automatic six-month extension to file.
Note, however, that an extension to file is not an extension to pay. You will be charged interest (currently running at 7%) and a penalty on any amount you still owe for 2022 but haven’t paid by April 18.
So if you suspect you still owe tax — perhaps you had some income outside of your job for which tax wasn’t withheld or you had a big capital gain last year — approximate how much more you owe and send that money to the IRS by Tuesday.
You can choose to do so by mail, attaching a check to your extension request form. Make sure your envelope is postmarked no later than April 18.
Or the more efficient route is pay what you owe electronically at IRS.gov, said CPA Damien Martin, a tax partner at EY. If you do that, the IRS notes you will not have to file a Form 4868. “The IRS will automatically process an extension of time to file,” the agency notes in its instructions.
If you opt to electronically pay directly from your bank account, which is free, select “extension” and then “tax year 2022” when given the option.
You can also pay by credit or debit card, but you will be charged a processing fee. Doing so, though, may become much more costly than just a fee if you charge your tax payment but don’t pay your credit card bill off in full every month, since you likely pay a high interest rate on outstanding balances.
If you still owe income taxes to your state, remember that you may need to go through a similar exercise of filing for an extension and making a payment to your state’s revenue department, Martin said.

A Columbia graduate facing deportation over his pro-Palestinian activism on campus has outlined the “irreparable harm” caused by his continued detention as a federal judge weighs his release
NEW YORK -- A Columbia graduate facing deportation over his pro-Palestinian activism on campus has outlined the “irreparable harm” caused by his continued detention as a federal judge weighs his release.
Mahmoud Khalil said in court filings unsealed Thursday that the “most immediate and visceral harms” he’s faced in his months detained in Louisiana relate to missing out on the birth of his first child in April.
“Instead of holding my wife’s hand in the delivery room, I was crouched on a detention center floor, whispering through a crackling phone line as she labored alone,” the 30-year-old legal U.S. resident wrote. “When I heard my son’s first cries, I buried my face in my arms so no one would see me weep.”
He also cited potentially “career-ending” harms from the ordeal, noting that Oxfam International has already rescinded a job offer to serve as a policy advisor.
Even his mother’s visa to come to the U.S. to help care for his infant son is also now under federal review, Khalil said.
“As someone who fled prosecution in Syria for my political beliefs, for who I am, I never imagined myself to be in immigration detention, here in the United States,” he wrote. “Why should protesting this Israel government’s indiscriminate killing of thousands of innocent Palestinians result in the erosion of my constitutional rights?”
Spokespersons for the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
Khalil’s 13-page statement was among a number of legal declarations his lawyers filed highlighting the wide-ranging negative impacts of his arrest.
Dr. Noor Abdalla, his U.S. citizen wife, described the challenges of not having her husband to help navigate their son’s birth and the first weeks of his young life.
Students and professors at Columbia wrote about the chilling effect Khalil's arrest has had on campus life, with people afraid to attend protests or participate in groups that can be viewed as critical of the Trump administration.
Last week, a federal judge in New Jersey said the Trump administration’s effort to deport Khalil likely violates the Constitution.
Judge Michael Farbiarz wrote the government’s primary justification for removing Khalil — that his beliefs may pose a threat to U.S. foreign policy — could open the door to vague and arbitrary enforcement.
Khalil was detained by federal immigration agents on March 8 in the lobby of his university-owned apartment, the first arrest under Trump’s widening crackdown on students who joined campus protests against Israel’s war in Gaza.",ABC News,"['department of homeland security', 'deportation', 'protests', 'visa']","['Columbia', 'NEW YORK', 'Columbia', 'Mahmoud Khalil', 'Louisiana', 'U.S.', 'Oxfam International', 'U.S.', 'Khalil', 'Syria', 'the United States', 'Israel', 'the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement', 'Khalil’s', 'Noor Abdalla', 'U.S.', 'Columbia', 'Khalil', 'Trump', 'New Jersey', 'Trump', 'Khalil', 'Constitution', 'Michael Farbiarz', 'Khalil', 'U.S.', 'Trump', 'Israel', 'Gaza']",
Democrats eye a villain-to-ally arc for Elon Musk,https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/05/elon-musk-democrats-donald-trump-00389961,"Thu, 05 Jun 2025 13:40:04 EST",The messy public breakup between two MAGA heavyweights makes some Dems wonder if there's a role for them to play.,"Democrats eye a villain-to-ally arc for Elon Musk
The messy public breakup between two MAGA heavyweights makes some Dems wonder if there’s a role for them to play.
Elon Musk has been the Democratic Party’s boogeyman since shortly after President Donald Trump deputized him as a top adviser. Their bitter breakup could complicate that.
After Musk called the GOP’s “big beautiful bill” a “disgusting abomination” and threatened to “fire all politicians” who backed it, the president mused on Thursday that he didn’t know if the two would still have a “great relationship.” Musk responded on his powerful platform X, “Without me, Trump would have lost,” adding “Such ingratitude.”
The split is giving some Democrats pause in their portrayal of Musk as a chainsaw-wielding, bureaucracy-breaking villain — with some saying they should give him another chance. After all, the billionaire tech mogul said he voted for former President Joe Biden in 2020 and gave a tour of SpaceX to then-President Barack Obama.
Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), who represents Silicon Valley and has known Musk for over a decade, said Democrats should “be in a dialogue” with Musk, given their shared opposition to the GOP’s megabill.
“We should ultimately be trying to convince him that the Democratic Party has more of the values that he agrees with,” Khanna said. “A commitment to science funding, a commitment to clean technology, a commitment to seeing international students like him.”
Other Democrats are warming back up to Musk as he leaves the White House and starts to break with his former boss in ways that could benefit the opposition.
“I’m a believer in redemption, and he is telling the truth about the legislation,” said Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.). But, he added, Musk has “done an enormous amount of damage” and “there are Democrats who see his decimation of the federal workforce and the federal government as an unforgivable sin.”
Liam Kerr, co-founder of the group behind the centrist Democrats’ WelcomeFest meeting this week in Washington, said “of course” Democrats should open the door if Musk wants back into the party.
“You don’t want anyone wildly distorting your politics, which he has a unique capability to do. But it’s a zero-sum game,” Kerr said. “Anything that he does that moves more toward Democrats hurts Republicans.”
Rep. Brad Schneider (D-Ill.), the chair of the New Democrat Coalition who earlier this year supported the party’s targeting of Musk as the Department of Government Efficiency slashed through federal agencies, said that with his departure from Washington, Democrats shouldn’t make Musk their focus. “We should be talking about what we’re doing for the American people,” he said.
Still, Musk recently threatened to cut off the money spigot for Republicans. And Democrats would have a lot to gain by merely keeping the world’s richest man on the sidelines in the midterm elections and beyond. If Musk makes a mess of GOP primaries, that would work in their favor, too.
But Musk’s recent heel-turn also risks reopening a divide between progressives and moderates over how to approach him and other billionaires.
“Our caucus has done the right thing and gone toe-to-toe against Musk,” said Rep. Greg Casar (D-Texas), chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and one of the party’s most vocal advocates for making Musk an antagonist on the campaign trail.
Others are taking a wait-and-see approach. “I don’t think we should take one ketamine-fueled tweet as evidence of a change of heart,” said Matt Bennett, co-founder of the center-left group Third Way. “It’s more complicated.”",Politico,['international students'],"['MAGA', 'Elon Musk', 'the Democratic Party’s', 'Donald Trump', 'Musk', 'GOP', 'Trump', 'Joe Biden', 'Barack Obama', 'Ro Khanna', 'GOP', 'the Democratic Party', 'Khanna', 'the White House', 'Ritchie Torres', 'Musk', 'Liam Kerr', 'Washington', 'Kerr', 'Brad Schneider', 'the New Democrat Coalition', 'the Department of Government Efficiency', 'Washington', 'Musk', 'GOP', 'Musk', 'Greg Casar', 'the Congressional Progressive Caucus', 'Matt Bennett']",

"Amid “Breakup” With Trump, Some Democrats Say Party Should Start Courting Musk",https://truthout.org/articles/amid-breakup-with-trump-some-democrats-say-party-should-start-courting-musk/,"Thu, 05 Jun 2025 21:16:58 +0000",Musk has not indicated he has changed his ideological views to support established Democratic Party causes.,"Amid the ongoing feud between President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk, some Democrats are advocating for courting Musk as an ally — a move that demonstrates the willingness of some members of the party to compromise principles to win elections.
Over the past week, Musk has openly and frequently criticized Trump’s budget proposal — the so-called “Big Beautiful Bill,” which includes a redistribution of wealth from the poor to the wealthy and huge cuts to social programs that will likely devastate millions of Americans. While Musk has not criticized it for those negative impacts, he has called the budget bill a “disgusting abomination” and said voters should “fire all politicians” who support it.
During a presser in the White House on Thursday, Trump expressed dismay at Musk’s opposition to the bill, saying he believed the Tesla CEO was mainly “upset” about the elimination of electric vehicle tax credits.
“I’m very disappointed in Elon. I’ve helped Elon a lot,” Trump said.
Musk, responding to the president in real-time on his social media site X, claimed “the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK” was the main reason why he opposed the bill. He also lashed out at Trump.
“Without me, Trump would have lost the election,” said Musk, who spent a quarter of a billion dollars of his own wealth to help elect the current president last fall.
Musk also alleged that Trump’s connection to Jeffrey Epstein, who was convicted for paying a minor for sex and was accused of trafficking children for sex before his death in 2019, was stronger than what’s been publicly disclosed.
“@realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public,” Musk wrote.
Democrats have been well aware of the animosity brewing between Musk and Trump, with some apparently hoping to capitalize on it. According to a report from Politico published earlier this week, a number of prominent Democrats in Congress want to court Musk to their side, now that his relationship with Trump has frayed.
“We should ultimately be trying to convince him that the Democratic Party has more of the values that he agrees with,” Rep. Ro Khanna (D-California) said, according to Politico. “A commitment to science funding, a commitment to clean technology, a commitment to seeing international students like him.”
Democrats should “be in a dialogue” with Musk, particularly over his opposition to Trump’s budget proposal, Khanna added.
Centrist Democratic Party organizer Liam Kerr was more upfront with the political calculations of befriending Musk.
“You don’t want anyone wildly distorting your politics, which he has a unique capability to do. But it’s a zero-sum game. Anything that he does that moves more toward Democrats hurts Republicans,” Politico quoted Kerr as saying.
Beyond the financial advantages Democrats would gain – which they already seem to recognize in their fundraising from SpaceX lobbyists – courting the Tesla CEO makes little to sense as a strategy to distinguish themselves from Trump, as Musk has not signaled any changes in his policy or ideological stances amid his falling out with the president.
Musk frequently lies on social media, promoting right-wing beliefs and spreading hateful rhetoric, particularly toward LGBTQ people and immigrants — and he has not disavowed those sentiments. Musk has also falsely framed social security as a “ponzi scheme,” and he supports dismantling other social programs.
Musk has also not repudiated fascistic points of view. Earlier this year, Musk gave his support to Alternative for Germany (AfD), a neo-Nazi political party, in that country’s elections. The billionaire also notably raised his hand during an inauguration celebration for Trump in what appeared to be a Nazi salute.
Even on Trump’s budget bill itself, Musk has supported aspects of it.
“Keep the good, remove the bad,” Musk wrote in a tweet on Thursday.
Multiple left-leaning voices, reacting to the Politico report, spoke out against the idea of trying to persuade Musk to align with the Democratic Party.
“No. Absolutely not,” said political commentator Allison Gill. “He’s a nazi. He smashed the federal government and stole our data. He put USAID and USIP in a wood chipper, leaving hundreds of thousands of children to die. He’s not welcome in any party I belong to.
“If Democrats rehab musk like they rehabbed [former President] George W. Bush, they deserve to lose – over and over and over,” Daily Kos reporter Oliver Willis wrote in a post on Bluesky.

The companies reject Mexico’s allegations, arguing the country’s lawsuit comes nowhere close to showing they’re responsible for a relatively few people using their products to commit violence. READ MORE: Why Mexico is asking the Supreme Court to weigh in on gun trafficking A federal judge tossed out the lawsuit under a 2005 law that protects gun companies from most civil lawsuits, but an appeals court revived it. The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston found it fell under an exception to the shield law for situations in which firearm companies are accused of knowingly breaking laws in their business practices. That exception has come up in other cases, including in lawsuits stemming from mass shootings. Families of victims of the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, for example, argued it applied to their lawsuit because the gunmaker had violated state law in the marketing of the AR-15 rifle used in the shooting, in which 20 first graders and six educators were killed. The families eventually secured a landmark $73 million settlement with Remington, the maker of the rifle. Support PBS News Hour Your donation makes a difference in these uncertain times.

Judge and lawmakers question the Trump administration's plan to gut Job Corps centers,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/judge-lawmakers-question-trump-administrations-plan-gut-job-122556577,"Thu, 05 Jun 2025 17:58:32 -0400",Members of Congress and a federal judge are questioning the Trump administration&rsquo;s plan to shut down Job Corps centers nationwide,"Judge and lawmakers question the Trump administration's plan to gut Job Corps centers
Members of Congress and a federal judge are questioning the Trump administration’s plan to shut down Job Corps centers nationwide
Members of Congress and a federal judge are questioning the Trump administration's plan to shut down Job Corps centers nationwide and halt a residential career training program for low-income youth that was established more than 50 years ago.
The Department of Labor last week announced a nationwide “pause of operations” for dozens of Job Corps centers run by private contractors. The department cited an internal review that concluded the program was costly and had a low success rate.
The review also identified safety issues at the residential campuses. The Department of Labor said it would transition students and staff out of the locations by June 30.
The program was designed for teenagers and young adults who struggled to finish high school in traditional school settings and then go on to obtain training and find jobs. Participants received tuition-free housing, meals and health care.
Critics have argued that closing the campuses would leave young people homeless and deprive them of opportunities and hope. They also maintained the Trump administration did not have legal authority to suspend Job Corps because it was created by Congress.
Lawmakers asked Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer about the decision when she appeared before the House Education and Workforce Committee on Thursday.
“Job Corps, which you know has bipartisan support in Congress, trains young, low-income people, and helps them find good-paying jobs and provides housing for a population that might otherwise be without a home,” U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott said.
Scott, a Virginia Democrat, read from a letter Chavez-DeRemer wrote in support of Job Corps last year. The letter said the program increased participants' employment and wages, and decreased their reliance on public benefits.
“You've made a starkly abrupt shift from a champion to a destroyer of this important program,” said Democratic Rep. Suzanne Bonamici of Oregon, adding that students in her district were distraught.
In response, Chavez-DeRemer said she recognized that only an act of Congress could eliminate Job Corps. She said the Labor Department had instead used its authority to halt the program's operations but planned to comply with a federal court order that temporarily blocked the action.
U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter of New York issued a temporary restraining order on Wednesday that prohibited the Labor Department from terminating jobs, removing students from the 99 contractor-run centers or eliminating the Job Corps program without congressional authorization.
The order was sought as part of a lawsuit filed Tuesday by the National Job Corps Association, a trade group which includes business, labor, volunteer and community organizations. The group alleged the Labor Department's decision would have disastrous consequences, including displacing tens of thousands of vulnerable young people and forcing mass layoffs.
During Thursday's House committee hearing, Scott asked several Job Corps students in attendance to stand.
“These students were on their way to getting a good job and earning a living wage. On behalf of them, I urge you to immediately reverse the decision to effectively shut down all Job Corps centers,” Scott said.
Chavez-DeRemer responded that the Trump administration wanted to eliminate ineffective training interventions. The report released in April by the Labor Department's Employment and Training Administration said Job Corps operated at a $140 million deficit during the last fiscal year and had an average graduation rate of under 39%.
“Our recently released Job Corps transparency report showed that in 2023 alone, more than 14,000 serious incidents were reported at the Job Corps centers, including cases of sexual assault, physical violence, and drug use,” Chavez-DeRemer said. “This program is failing to deliver safe and successful outcomes our young people deserve.”
The National Job Corps Association maintained the statistics were misleading. It said the 14,000 serious incidents included power outages, inclement weather, athletic injuries that required treatment and adult students leaving campus without prior approva.
The group also said that Job Corps' graduation rates have historically been above 60%, but were depressed by COVID-19 policies during the year the Labor Department reviewed.
Seth Harris, senior fellow at the Burnes Center for Social Change at Northeastern University, said in an interview that Job Corps is wildly popular on Capitol Hill. He recalled having to slow down Job Corps due to funding challenges when he served as acting secretary of labor during former President Barack Obama’s administration.
“I got angry calls from elected members of the House and Senate on both sides of the aisle,” Harris said.
The Job Corps program was designed to help young people who were not succeeding in school or who had left school without a place to go, placing them in a residential setting outside their community and providing them with vocational training, he said.
The Labor Department shutting down Job Corps would be illegal because there’s a process outlined for closing down the centers which includes publishing performance data, justifying the closure and allowing time for public comment and remediation, he said.
“This is plainly illegal,” Harris said. “But it is entirely on brand for Donald Trump to beat up on poor kids, largely kids of color, who are trying to make their lives better.”",ABC News,"['lawsuit', 'temporary restraining order', 'mass layoffs']","['Trump', 'Job Corps', 'Congress', 'Trump', 'Job Corps', 'Congress', 'Trump', 'Job Corps', 'The Department of Labor', 'Job Corps', 'The Department of Labor', 'Trump', 'Job Corps', 'Congress', 'Labor', 'Lori Chavez-DeRemer', 'the House Education', 'Workforce Committee', 'Congress', 'U.S.', 'Bobby Scott', 'Scott', 'Virginia', 'Chavez-DeRemer', 'Job Corps', 'Suzanne Bonamici', 'Oregon', 'Chavez-DeRemer', 'Congress', 'Job Corps', 'the Labor Department', 'U.S.', 'Andrew Carter', 'New York', 'the Labor Department', 'Job Corps', 'the National Job Corps Association', ""the Labor Department's"", 'House', 'Scott', 'Job Corps', 'Job Corps', 'Scott', 'Chavez-DeRemer', 'Trump', ""the Labor Department's"", 'Employment and Training Administration', 'Job Corps', '$140 million', 'Job Corps', 'Job Corps', 'Chavez-DeRemer', 'The National Job Corps Association', ""Job Corps'"", 'the Labor Department', 'Seth Harris', 'the Burnes Center for Social Change', 'Northeastern University', 'Job Corps', 'Capitol Hill', 'Job Corps', 'Barack Obama', 'House', 'Senate', 'Harris', 'Job Corps', 'The Labor Department', 'Job Corps', 'Harris', 'Donald Trump']",Threats to Research and Higher Education Funding from Heightened Regulatory Change and Scrutiny

A Maltese jury has found two men guilty of complicity in the murder of Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia
VALLETTA, Malta -- A Maltese jury found two men guilty of complicity in the murder of Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, after a six-week long trial covering two homicides wrapped up late on Thursday.
Jamie Vella and Robert Agius were accused of supplying the bomb that killed her. Both were found guilty of the charges.
The journalist was murdered on Oct. 16, 2017, by a car bomb that was detonated while she was driving near her home.
Caruana Galizia, 53, had written extensively about suspected corruption in political and business circles in Malta. Her murder shocked Europe and triggered angry protests in Malta.
Caruana Galizia's investigative reports had targeted people in then-Prime Minister Joseph Muscat’s inner circle whom she accused of having offshore companies in tax havens disclosed in the Panama Papers leak. She also targeted the opposition. When she was killed, she was facing more than 40 libel suits.
The Caruana Galizia family said in a statement that Thursday's verdict brings them a step closer to justice.
“Yet, eight years after Daphne’s brutal assassination, the institutional failures that enabled her murder remain unaddressed and unreformed,” the family added.
Vella and Robert Agius, together with two other men – George Degiorgio and Adrian Agius – also faced charges related to the separate murder of a lawyer, Carmel Chircop, who was shot and killed in 2015. Vella, Degiorgio and Adrian Agius were found guilty of charges tied to the murder, while Robert Agius was found not guilty.
The judge will decide on sentencing at a later date.
George Degiorgio and his brother Alfred Degiorgio both pleaded guilty in 2022 to carrying out the murder of Caruana Galizia. They were each sentenced to 40 years in prison.
A third man, Vincent Muscat, pleaded guilty in 2021 for his role in the Caruana Galizia murder, and was sentenced to 15 years in prison. He testified in the recent jury trial after being granted a presidential pardon for his role in the Chircop murder on the condition he tell the whole truth.

10 American inventions that helped win D-Day,https://www.businessinsider.com/american-inventions-helped-win-d-day-2025-6,2025-06-06T19:06:53Z,Learn how American inventions that helped the Allies invade Normandy on D-Day gave way to equipment being used decades later in modern combat.,"- American inventions proved their worth in the Normandy campaign that began on June 6, 1944.
- They allowed Allied forces to shoot, move and communicate in the arduous D-Day landings.
- From floating trucks to walkie-talkies, evolved versions of these inventions remain in use today.
While June 6 marks the 81st anniversary of D-Day, the preparations and planning that went into the Normandy landings — a pivotal World War II turning point, and one of the largest amphibious assaults in history — were years in the making.
Getting nearly 160,000 Allied troops to storm a 50-mile stretch of heavily fortified French coastline called for an unprecedented level of coordination among American, British, and Canadian soldiers and equipment. It also put new technologies to the test.
""You have to control the air, the water, and the land all at once and come ashore with an inherent disadvantage,"" says National WWII Museum curator Cory Graff about Operation Overlord."" To do so successfully meant deploying not only manpower, but also a host of pioneering technologies and inventions — many of them American-made — from specialized landing craft to underwater breathing equipment to amphibious trucks.
""This idea of combined arms integration requires military formations to do three things: shoot, move, and communicate,"" adds John Curatola, senior historian at the National WWII Museum. The Normandy invasion required the US Army, Navy, and Army Air Force to collaborate in a unified manner for a singular objective, while also working with counterparts for the cross-Channel invasion, he says.
These are some of the inventions that helped Allied troops win D-Day, all of which have evolved into systems still in use today.
M4 Sherman
The M4 Sherman was the backbone of the Allied armored force during World War II. Weighing roughly 40 tons, it was fast, reliable, and built by the thousands.
Sherman tanks proved key in helping the Allies break through German defenses at Utah and Omaha Beaches. Some were equipped with a bulldozer blade on the front that could cut through the defenses on the beach — and that would later function as hedgecutters used to break through wall-like hedges throughout Normandy.
Other Shermans were converted into Duplex Drive (DD) tanks — an amphibious design pioneered by the British. Outfitted with canvas flotation skirts and rear-mounted propellers, the DDs were meant to hit the beach alongside the first wave of infantry. While rough seas and weather doomed many off Omaha, those that made it ashore at Utah and Gold Beaches delivered crucial early support.
""Everybody thinks the Germans had the coolest tanks, and I categorically reject that,"" says Curatola. ""The Shermans are relatively easy to maintain. The crews can fix them. They're relatively reliable with simple parts, and you're basically overwhelming the Germans with armor.""
Invented by: Developed by the U.S. Army Ordnance Department in 1941 and mass-produced by automakers including Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors. The US manufactured 50,000 throughout the war.
Modern connection: While the Sherman was retired from combat decades ago, its simple, rugged design shaped post-war tank development and reinforced the importance of armored vehicles. Curatola considers the M1 Abrams tank that the US Army uses today the ""grandson"" of the Sherman.
'Walkie Talkie'
Nicknamed the ""Walkie-Talkie,"" the Signal Corps Radio 300 was the first backpack radio for mobile infantry communication — and one of many radio varieties used on D-Day. Initially issued to US infantry in 1943, a soldier carried the nearly 40-pound SCR-300 transmitter and receiver on their back. With a three-mile range and 41 channels, the SCR-300 came in handy for real-time battalion-level communication during the highly chaotic, noisy beach landings
Invented by: Engineer Daniel E. Noble and his project team at Galvin Manufacturing Corporation. Originally founded by brothers Paul and Joseph Galvin pre-war to develop early car radios, Galvin became Motorola in 1947. Galvin engineers also developed a handheld, single-channel AM radio — the SCR-536, or ""Handie-Talkie"" — for battlefield communication at the platoon or company level.
Modern connection: The SCR-300's pioneering use of frequency modulation (or ""FM"") technology paved the foundation for future portable communication devices, including cell phones.
Higgins boats
The Landing Craft, Vehicle, Personnel was a 36-foot landing craft made famous in the opening scene of the 1998 film, ""Saving Private Ryan."" Known as Higgins boats for its American inventor, 1,000 LCVPs were used to deliver troops across all five beaches during the Normandy landings, which marked the single largest deployment of LCVPs. Without these shallow-bottomed boats, landing directly on the open beaches with armor and troops would've been logistically impossible.
Invented by: New-Orleans-based shipbuilder and entrepreneur Andrew Higgins of Higgins Industries. He is said to have borrowed the front ramp idea from Japanese boats after seeing photos from the Sino-Japanese War. Gen. Dwight Eisenhower called Higgins ""the man who won the war for us.""
Modern connection: The front-ramp design has continued to inspire modern amphibious landing craft, including the US Navy's Landing Craft Air Cushion and Landing Craft Utility.
Landing ship, tank
The LST was a large cargo vessel used to land troops and armored vehicles without docking to a pier. Its large bow doors were designed to open to a ramp that let tanks and trucks drive directly from the ship to land. ""To liberate continents, you need bulk. You need throughput…so you can do operations inland. And the LST allowed the Allies to do that without a fixed port,"" Curatola says.
Invented by: The LST was designed by American naval architect John C. Niedermair in response to Prime Minister Winston Churchill's request for a ship that would carry some 500 tons worth of tanks following the Dunkirk evacuation.
Modern connection: In a matter of hours, Niedermair sketched the design for a ship regarded as one of the most successful in the history of the US Navy.
The DUKW amphibious truck
The DUKW (pronounced ""duck"") was a 6-wheel-drive amphibious truck capable of transporting about 5,000 pounds of cargo (or 24 troops) on land and water; a propeller could chug it through water with a max speed of 6 mph. ""The beauty of this thing is, not only is it amphibious, but it can drive inland and provide supplies to troops well beyond the beach at up to 50 miles an hour,"" says Curatola.
Invented by: The DUKW was a product of collaborations among GMC, the naval architecture firm Sparkman & Stephens, and a Michigan-based bus manufacturer.
Modern connection: The DUKW pioneered a feature that allowed drivers to change the tire pressure from inside the cab to accommodate different terrains, which remains a common feature on military vehicles today.
Douglas C-47 transport
The C-47 Dakota, nicknamed ""the workhorse,"" had many uses in both World War II theaters, from cargo and troop transportation to casualty evacuation and towing. More than 800 C-47s were used in the D-Day campaign to insert thousands of paratroopers and huge amounts of equipment behind enemy lines.
Invented by: Douglas Aircraft Company adapted its pre-war commercial airliner, the DC-3, for military use. It was relatively quiet and could carry up to 28 troops or 6,000 pounds of cargo. The US produced more than 10,000 C-47s.
Modern connection: Valued for its versatility, the C-47 was used in the Vietnam War. Variants are still in use for civilian cargo transport.
A rebreather for divers
The Lambertsen Amphibious Respiratory Unit was a closed-circuit rebreather designed to recycle exhaled air by removing carbon dioxide and adding oxygen. The apparatus enabled divers to operate underwater for prolonged periods without leaving a trail of bubbles. Lambertsen, working for the Office of Strategic Services, trained OSS commandos to use the LARU for underwater reconnaissance and demolition missions in support of D-Day and other key landings.
Invented by: Christian Lambertsen, who, as a University of Pennsylvania medical student in the early 1940s, designed the LARU as a self-contained breathing device ideal for covert underwater missions.
Modern connection: Lambertsen himself coined the acronym ""SCUBA"" (Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus). His equipment and techniques paved the way for rebreathing technologies still used by military divers, including Navy SEALs. He's considered ""the father of US Combat Diving.""
Dummy paratroopers
These burlap, straw-stuffed mannequins were relatively small, lightweight decoys that could be dropped from planes to give the illusion of incoming paratroopers. A form of psychological warfare, the dolls were used to confuse and mislead the enemy. Dummies were sometimes equipped with noisemakers that sounded like gunfire or explosive charges that detonated on landing, adding to the illusion.
On the night of June 5, 1944, Allied planes dropped hundreds of these fake paratroopers, along with inflatable tanks, across the French countryside to give off the impression of airborne troops landing in areas far from the real drop zones. In several cases, German units responded to these fake drops.
Invented by: Inspired by the British ""Rupert"" paradummy, the American version, nicknamed ""Oscar,"" was more compact, with the 3-foot-tall ones used on D-Day mainly manufactured in the UK.
Modern connection: While today's military decoys are generally more technologically advanced (e.g., electronic signature emitters), the principle of deception through false targets and diversionary tactics remains.
Proximity fuze
The proximity fuze — an electronic fuze for bombs, shells, or missiles that explodes when approaching a target — changed the rules of artillery in warfare; instead of needing a direct hit, anti-aircraft shells could suddenly detonate when they got close. They made Allied anti-aircraft fire far more effective in taking out German planes, helping protect the beachhead.
Invented by: Developed beginning in 1940 by American scientists at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, with critical contributions from British researchers. Key to the design was the miniature radio transmitter and receiver inside the shell that sensed nearby targets and triggered detonation.
Modern connection: The proximity fuze was a major step toward today's precision-guided weapons. Its combination of electronic sensing and remote detonation paved the way for modern guided bombs and missiles.
The Jeep
From the moment the first Allied troops hit the beaches of Normandy, this newly introduced American 4x4 was in motion, hauling supplies, ferrying wounded soldiers, towing anti-tank guns, and zipping across shell-scarred roads. Compact, reliable, and endlessly adaptable, it proved essential to the invasion of Normandy, along with many other battles.
Invented by: In 1940, facing the likelihood of entering the war, the US Army issued an emergency contract for a lightweight reconnaissance vehicle, prompting the development of the first Jeep prototype by Bantam Car Company in just 49 days. With Bantam lacking production capacity, Willys-Overland and Ford were tapped to manufacture the final design, cranking out hundreds of thousands of units over the course of the war. Some Jeeps were waterproofed for the landings, sealed tight and fitted with snorkels to wade ashore behind the infantry. Others were dropped by parachute into French fields with the 101st and 82nd Airborne, ready to drive the moment they hit the ground.
Modern connection: After the war, Willys began selling civilian versions, branding them as Civilian Jeep models and kickstarting America's obsession with off-road vehicles and SUVs.

Geoff Bennett: An extraordinary feud erupted into public view today between President Donald Trump and his one-time ally Elon Musk, with Mr. Trump saying he was very disappointed in Musk for criticizing the GOP's massive domestic policy bill. That's as President Trump today also defended his sweeping new travel ban on citizens from 12 different countries and restricting entry from seven more. Amna Nawaz: The president claims it will protect U.S. national security. The ban mostly affects people from Africa and the Middle East and will take effect on Monday.White House correspondent Laura Barron-Lopez has our report. Laura Barron-Lopez: Pointing to Sunday's violent attack in Boulder, Colorado, President Trump unveiled his new travel ban last night.Donald Trump, President of the United States: The recent terror attack in Boulder, Colorado, has underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted. Laura Barron-Lopez: Banning citizens from 12 countries from entering the United States and restricting access for seven other countries. Trump claimed it's necessary to prevent terror attacks. Donald Trump: Very simply, we cannot have open migration from any country where we cannot safely and reliably vet and screen those who seek to enter the United States. Laura Barron-Lopez: On the list, Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, while citizens from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela face heightened restrictions for entry.Notably not on the list, Egypt. That despite Trump using the Boulder suspect, who is an Egyptian national, as justification for his actions. During a visit with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in the Oval Office today, Trump defended his decision to leave Egypt off the list. Donald Trump: Egypt has been a country that we deal with very closely. They have things under control. The countries that we have don't have things under control. Laura Barron-Lopez: There are some key exemptions in place, including for those who are dual citizens, legal residents, refugees or asylum grantees already in the U.S. and athletes traveling for events like the World Cup and Olympics.At JFK Airport in New York City, some said the policy seemed shortsighted. Suleiman Kenyi, New Jersey Resident: We seem to be isolating ourselves from the rest of the world. So, wherever we draw back, I think the Chinese and other countries kind of fill in the gap, which is not good for — from my point of view, not good in the long term. Laura Barron-Lopez: The new travel ban is significantly larger in scope than the executive order issued during the early days of the first Trump administration. That policy banned citizens from predominantly Muslim countries, like Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen.After a chaotic implementation and legal challenges, the Supreme Court upheld a version of the ban in 2018. Despite waiting more than four months to issue it, Trump said that his travel ban can't come soon enough. Donald Trump: We're not stopping until we get them out. Laura Barron-Lopez: But the president didn't linger on the new policy, instead focusing more on the precarious future of his budget bill and the economy. Donald Trump: We have almost perfect inflation. Grocery prices are down, everything. Remember eggs? Eggs have come down 400 percent. Everybody has eggs now. Laura Barron-Lopez: Egg prices have decreased since peaks earlier this winter, but it's closer to a 61 percent drop, not 400 percent.Wholesale prices for businesses have dropped, but economists say the impact of Trump's tariff policies will likely drive them up again later this summer. And Trump lashed out at former adviser Elon Musk. Donald Trump: I'm very disappointed in Elon. I have helped Elon a lot. Laura Barron-Lopez: This week, Musk publicly criticized the president's tax bill, calling it a disgusting abomination. Donald Trump: Look, Elon and I had a great relationship. I don't know if we will anymore. Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here, better than you people. He knew everything about it. He had no problem with it. All of a sudden, he had a problem, and he only developed the problem when he found out that we're going to have to cut the E.V. mandate. Laura Barron-Lopez: Musk quickly responded on his social media platform X, saying: ""Whatever. Republicans can get rid of the Biden era tax credit for electric vehicles as long as they ditch the mountain of disgusting pork in the bill.""Musk's attacks didn't end there, posting: ""Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate.""Within hours, the president took to his own platform, TRUTH Social, saying ""Musk went crazy"" and that ""The easiest way to save money in our budget, billions and billions of dollars, is to terminate Elon's governmental subsidies and contracts.""The mutually beneficial relationship between two of the most powerful men in the world appears to be over. Musk dropping what he called a really big bomb about alleged ties between the president and convicted sex offender and financier Jeffrey Epstein. Musk said: ""Donald Trump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public.""Some conspiracy theorists believe the government is hiding information about the death of Epstein. The Trump administration released a first phase of documents earlier this year.As the president and Elon Musk continue their public fight on social media, Tesla's stock price plunged this afternoon, dropping 14 percent. And shares in Trump Media and Technology Group, the TRUTH Social parent company, also took an 8 percent hit — Amna. Amna Nawaz: Well, let's pick up where you left off there and the feud between the president and Elon Musk that is escalating by the minute. What's the latest on that? Laura Barron-Lopez: So this fight carried on for hours, Amna. And Musk posted again on his social media platform, X, saying that he will immediately decommission his Dragon spacecraft.That's the only U.S. option for delivering the crew to and from the International Space Station. Elon Musk continued, amplifying a post calling for the president's impeachment. And he also said that the president's tariffs will — quote — ""cause a recession in the second half of the year.""Now, President Trump fired back on TRUTH Social, saying that he didn't mind that Elon Musk turned on him, but said that Musk should have done it months ago.So, this ongoing fight exploding today, less than a week after Elon Musk and Donald Trump were in the Oval Office saying their goodbyes. Amna Nawaz: Laura, is any of this going to have an impact on the president's budget bill that he's trying to push through right now? Laura Barron-Lopez: So the president and the Republican Senate leadership can only lose three votes in the Senate. But some sources close to the White House said that the bill was in a tough spot as of this morning, but that they think that this fight between Elon Musk and the president could actually have a rallying effect for the president, essentially Republicans rallying around the president.As for the relationship between the two men, a source close to the president said that they think that the president's threats about canceling those government contracts that Musk's businesses have with the government, that that's a very real threat, and that ultimately Musk could end up being attacked and targeted in the way that the president has attacked his other perceived enemies. Amna Nawaz: Let's turn back to that travel ban you were reporting on. We heard the president talk about the national security interests here.What more do we know about the reasoning behind these countries targeted in the ban? Laura Barron-Lopez: We spoke to Simon Hankinson, a Heritage Foundation worker who also worked at the State Department for more than two decades. And he argued that this ban was really about cracking down on visa overstays and the refusal of countries to take back their nationals, which the DHS said as well, that essentially they are trying to pressure countries to take deportation flights of their citizens.Now, Hankinson argued that he doesn't think this ban is going to have that big of effect on students and talent coming to the U.S. because of the fact that the countries affected don't include India and China, which are some of the countries that immigrants come from the most to the U.S. for studying.It's important to note, though, Amna, that in the president's order and as well as the president's statements, he has repeatedly said that this is about combating terrorism and to prevent national security threats. Amna Nawaz: And, on that point, you reported on that. The president cited the Boulder attack. The suspect in that case is from Egypt. Egypt is not on this list. What are the facts that we know about terrorist attacks that are committed by people from these countries on the ban list? Laura Barron-Lopez: I spoke to Alex Nowrasteh. And he's with the Cato Institute. He and his team analyzed the actual number of immigrants and the threats from immigrants who come from these banned countries over the last 50 years. Alex Nowrasteh, Cato Institute: Since 1975, only one person has been murdered in a terrorist attack on U.S. soil committed by somebody from one of these banned countries. These bans are more about the president flexing his power and trying to reduce immigration to the United States by first going after countries that aren't that important, frankly, that don't send that many people to the United States.And then I think we will slowly see him add countries to the list over time.

"‘Such ingratitude’: Musk, Trump blow up over GOP megabill",https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/05/elon-musk-donald-trump-fight-00389480,"Thu, 05 Jun 2025 11:28:04 EST",Musk has been on a three-day rampage against Republicans' reconciliation package.,"‘Such ingratitude’: Musk, Trump blow up over GOP megabill
Musk has been on a three-day rampage against Republicans’ reconciliation package.
President Donald Trump publicly chastised Elon Musk — his onetime adviser and a major political benefactor — on Thursday, amid the Tesla CEO’s continued attempts to take down the cornerstone of Republicans’ legislative agenda.
Responding to a question about Musk’s posts during a bilateral meeting with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz at the White House, Trump said he was “surprised” and “disappointed” by Musk’s attacks.
“Elon and I had a great relationship,” Trump told reporters. “I don’t know if we will anymore.” He later said he was “very disappointed in Elon” and that “I’ve helped Elon a lot.”
The comments are Trump’s first public response to Musk’s attempts to take down his marquee legislation — and the biggest crack yet in a growing feud between the president and the world’s wealthiest man. After shattering fundraising records to sweep Trump into the White House, Musk was tapped to lead the Department of Government Efficiency and given broad authority — with little oversight — to slash his way through the federal bureaucracy.
On Friday, the day Musk’s “special government employee” status was set to expire, Musk and Trump appeared in the Oval Office together, thanking each other for their work over the course of a friendly, nearly hourlong news conference.
Less than a week later, that relationship appears to have soured.
“He hasn’t said [anything] bad about me personally, but I’m sure that will be next,” the president said on Thursday.
Sure enough, minutes later, Musk said on X: “Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate.”
“Such ingratitude,” Musk added. He donated nearly $300 million in the 2024 election.
Later on Thursday, after Musk and Trump continued to trade attacks, Musk suggested that Trump’s name appears in records of the investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and said the records “have not been made public” to conceal that fact.
In February, the Department of Justice released what it called the “first phase” of documents related to the Epstein investigation, which has been a fixation of some of the president’s supporters. It has long been public that Trump — along with other prominent figures, like Bill Clinton — are referenced in documents released in court cases surrounding Epstein. But Trump is not accused of any wrongdoing linked to Epstein.
The White House and the Department of Justice did not immediately respond to Musk’s allegations.
Musk has been on a three-day rampage against Republicans’ reconciliation package in Congress. Before Trump’s Oval Office criticism, he needled Trump directly for the first time — resurfacing old social media posts in which Trump said he was “embarrassed” by Republican efforts to extend the debt limit.
Musk shared the posts on X, which he owns, adding his own facetious approval.
“I cannot believe the Republicans are extending the debt ceiling—I am a Republican & I am embarrassed!,” Trump wrote in the January 2013 post.
“Wise words,” Musk replied in a post on Thursday.
Musk also replied to a Trump post from 2012 in which he said members of Congress should not be eligible for reelection if the U.S. doesn’t have a balanced budget.
“I couldn’t agree more!,” Musk wrote.
Trump in the Oval Office claimed Musk had known “the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody” and “he had no problem with it.” That changed, Trump said, once Musk left the government last week. He lumped Musk into a cadre of other former White House aides who have gone on to sharply criticize him, calling it an example of “Trump Derangement Syndrome.”
Trump said Musk had been “disturbed” by a part of the over-1,000-page legislation that would cut subsidies for electric vehicles, which would undermine Musk’s company, Tesla. He also suggested Musk had been disappointed when Trump last week pulled the nomination for Jared Isaacman to lead NASA. Musk had recommended Isaacman for the role, but Trump said he had decided to select someone else because Isaacman “happened to be a Democrat, like totally Democrat.”
“Suddenly he had a problem, and he only developed the problem when he found out we’re going to cut the EV mandate that’s billions and billions of dollars,” Trump said.
Musk quickly brushed aside Trump’s comments at the White House and urged Republicans to scale down the bill’s scope. He also denied Trump’s claim that he knew the “inner workings” of the bill, writing in yet another post that the bill “was never shown to me even once.”
“Keep the EV/solar incentive cuts in the bill, even though no oil & gas subsidies are touched (very unfair!!), but ditch the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK in the bill,” Musk wrote.
Musk’s attacks began on Tuesday when he called the bill a “disgusting abomination” in a post on X. Since then, he’s posted dozens of times chastising the bill for increasing spending and for raising the debt ceiling. In multiple posts, he’s suggested the bill would push the U.S. into “debt slavery.”
But the post on Thursday using Trump’s own words to accentuate his argument escalates the growing tension between the president and the world’s richest man, who was a staunch Trump ally up until this week. Musk shattered records helping Trump and congressional Republicans get elected in 2024, and had spent big in an ultimately unsuccessful effort in a Wisconsin Supreme Court race earlier this year.
But last month, Musk said he would step back from political spending. This week, he suggested he may no longer contribute to politicians who support the bill.
Musk’s attacks come as Senate Republicans work to corral enough support in their ranks to approve the bill.
On Wednesday, Trump called for the debt ceiling to be “entirely scrapped” to prevent an economic “catastrophe,” and praised Sen.

""I took a burner phone. Imagine that.""","British journalist Christiane Amanpour said she treats travel to the U.S. under President Donald Trump “as if I was going to North Korea.”
The longtime CNN correspondent talked about her experience flying to the U.S. on her podcast, “The Ex Files.”
“I must say I was afraid,” Amanpour told her co-host and ex-husband, Jamie Rubin, on Wednesday’s episode.
Amanpour was traveling to the U.S. last week to give a speech at Harvard University, which has come under increased attacks by Trump, including revoking the university’s ability to enroll international students.
Trump has also ramped up his attacks on immigrants, using agents with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to snatch people off the streets and imprison them without due process.
And on Thursday, Trump announced that citizens of 12 countries would be banned from visiting the U.S. and seven others that would face restrictions.
“I’m a foreigner,” Amanpour said. “I don’t have a green card. I’m not an American citizen. I’m fairly prominent, and I literally prepared to go to America as if I was going to North Korea. I took a burner phone, Jamie. Imagine that. I didn’t take a single … not my mobile phone, not my iPad, nothing, and I had nothing on the burner phone except a few numbers.”
Amanpour said she also spoke to CNN security about what precautions to take.
“I’ve heard that many, including British citizens, have been stopped at the border and been questioned for hours and hours and hours,” she said.
Thankfully, Amanpour said she went through airport security without any issues.
“I was welcomed,” she said. “The immigration officer at Boston, where I came in, could not have been nicer. Huge sigh of relief I breathed.”",Huffington Post,"['international students', 'revoking', 'harvard university']","['Christiane Amanpour', 'U.S.', 'Donald Trump', 'North Korea', 'CNN', 'U.S.', 'Jamie Rubin', 'U.S.', 'Harvard University', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement', 'Trump', 'U.S.', 'Amanpour', 'America', 'North Korea', 'Jamie', 'iPad', 'Amanpour', 'CNN', 'Amanpour', 'Boston']",

The Trump administration says migrants placed on a deportation flight originally bound for South Sudan are now being held in a converted shipping container on a U.S. naval base in Djibouti, where the men and their guards are contending with baking hot ...
WASHINGTON -- Migrants placed on a deportation flight originally bound for South Sudan are now being held in a converted shipping container on a U.S. naval base in Djibouti, where the men and their guards are contending with baking hot temperatures, smoke from nearby burn pits and the looming threat of rocket attacks, the Trump administration said.
Officials outlined grim conditions in court documents filed Thursday before a federal judge overseeing a lawsuit challenging Immigration and Customs Enforcement efforts to swiftly remove migrants to countries they didn't come from.
Authorities landed the flight at the base in Djibouti, about 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) from South Sudan, more than two weeks ago after U.S. District Judge Brian E. Murphy in Boston found the Trump administration had violated his order by swiftly sending eight migrants from countries including Cuba and Vietnam to the east African nation.
The judge said that men from other countries must have a real chance to raise fears about dangers they could face in South Sudan.
The men's lawyers, though, have still not been able to talk to them, said Robyn Barnard, senior director of refugee advocacy at Human Rights First, whose stated mission is to ensure the United States is a global leader on human rights. Barnard spoke Friday at a hearing of Democratic members of Congress and said some family members of the men had been able to talk to them Thursday.
The migrants have been previously convicted of serious crimes in the U.S., and President Donald Trump's administration has said that it was unable to return them quickly to their home countries. The Justice Department has also appealed to the Supreme Court to immediately intervene and allow swift deportations to third countries to resume.
The case comes amid a sweeping immigration crackdown by the Republican administration, which has pledged to deport millions of people who are living in the United States illegally. The legal fight became another flashpoint as the administration rails against judges whose rulings have slowed the president’s policies.
The Trump administration said the converted conference room in the shipping container is the only viable place to house the men on the base in Djibouti, where outdoor daily temperatures rise above 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius), according to the declaration from an ICE official.
Nearby burn pits are used to dispose of trash and human waste, and the smog cloud makes it hard to breathe, sickening both ICE officers guarding the men and the detainees, the documents state. They don’t have access to all the medication they need to protect against infection, and the ICE officers were unable to complete anti-malarial treatment before landing, an ICE official said.
“It is unknown how long the medical supply will last,” Mellissa B. Harper, acting executive deputy associate director of enforcement and removal operations, said in the declaration.
The group also lacks protective gear in case of a rocket attack from terrorist groups in Yemen, a risk outlined by the Department of Defense, the documents state.

Markets digest bank earnings after recent turmoil,https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/stock-market-bank-earnings/index.html,"Fri, 14 Apr 2023 20:00:28 GMT",,"Stocks slid Friday after a slate of earnings beats from big banks fueled concerns that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its next two meetings.
Still, the major indices gained for the week. The Dow rose 400 points, or 1.2%. The S&P 500 gained 0.8% and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.3%.
JPMorgan Chase on Friday reported first-quarter profit and revenue that crushed expectations, boosted by the Fed’s interest rate hiking campaign. Citigroup, Wells Fargo and PNC Financial also reported strong results.
CEO Jamie Dimon warned investors in the company’s post-earnings conference call that they should prepare for interest rates to be higher for longer than expected.
Wall Street seems to have taken note. Analysts increased their bets on a quarter-point rate hike at the Fed’s meeting in May and another in June.
Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Friday that the central bank needs to continue tightening monetary policy, further weighing down markets.
Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said that it’s “definitely” possible the United States enters a mild recession after the tumult in banking last month.
Meanwhile, retail sales data declined more than expected, suggesting that Americans’ spending power and the US economy are weakening.
Consumer sentiment held fairly steady in April, even as concerns about a recession linger, according to the University of Michigan’s latest monthly survey.
“There was too much news to digest this morning, but the key takeaway is that the Fed has room to do more harm,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, said in a note.
The Dow slipped 144 points, or 0.4%.
The S&P 500 tumbled 0.2%.

Jimmy Kimmel Exposes Real Reason 'Furious' Trump Suddenly 'Disappeared',https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jimmy-kimmel-trump-disappear_n_68411bbde4b0280f7518ac03,"Thu, 05 Jun 2025 02:42:49 -0400",The late night host said the president has had one noticeable change in recent days.,"Jimmy Kimmel said the growing feud between Donald Trump and ex-pal Elon Musk has had one very unusual effect on the president: He’s been largely quiet.
“You can tell Trump doesn’t want to exacerbate this, even though he’s said to be furious,” Kimmel said, referring to a Fox News report that said the president is “furious” with Musk for turning on him and trashing the signature “big, beautiful bill” making its way through Congress.
“But he’s been unusually quiet,” Kimmel said. “He hasn’t punched back. In fact, he kind of disappeared today.”
Trump spent much of the past several days out of the spotlight, and even on Wednesday, his public appearances were more limited than is typical for him.
“Usually he’s got reporters in the Oval Office, he’s out yelling on the helipad,” Kimmel said. “He had none of that today: no executive orders, no angry posts about Elon on Truth Social.”
Kimmel noted it was very unlike Trump to show this degree of restraint.
“Between Elon and Melania, Trump now has two foreigners who won’t sleep with him,” Kimmel cracked.
He also had a warning for Musk.
“I keep waiting to see Musk on a one-way SpaceX to El Salvador,” he cracked.

'Biggest scandal in American history' or a 'distraction': A look at Trump's autopen claims,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/what-is-autopen-biden-signature-machine-trump-claims-rcna211185,"Thu, 05 Jun 2025 21:34:53 GMT",Trump said the Biden administration used an autopen to sign orders and pardons that the former president was not aware of — a claim Biden vigorously denies.,"President Donald Trump has ordered an investigation into the Biden administration's use of an automatic signature pen, alleging that Joe Biden wasn't aware of many of his presidential orders and appointments.
""This conspiracy marks one of the most dangerous and concerning scandals in American history,"" Trump said in a memorandum Wednesday directing the probe.
Biden denied the allegations, calling them ""ridiculous and false.""
“This is nothing more than a distraction by Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans who are working to push disastrous legislation that would cut essential programs like Medicaid and raise costs on American families, all to pay for tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy and big corporations,” Biden said in a statement Wednesday, referring to the massive GOP bill to advance Trump's agenda.
Here's a look at what's known — and what isn't — about the allegations Trump has referred to on social media as ""the biggest scandal in American history,"" how they started and what might come next.
What is an autopen?
An autopen is a device that replicates a person’s signature or writings. Variations of it have been around for centuries — Thomas Jefferson got one in 1803 that he used to make copies of his correspondence.
They’re often used for mass reproductions of signatures on items like diplomas, and there are now digital versions.
Can presidents use autopens for official actions?
They can, according to 2005 guidance from the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel.
“The President need not personally perform the physical act of affixing his signature to a bill he approves and decides to sign in order for the bill to become law,” the guidance said. “Rather, the President may sign a bill ... by directing a subordinate to affix the President’s signature to such a bill, for example by autopen.”
Have presidents used autopens for official acts?
They have. President George W. Bush — who had requested the guidance from the Justice Department — did not wind up using an autopen for official actions, but both Biden and President Barack Obama did while they were traveling.
USA Today reported in 2017 that Obama used an autopen to issue dozens of pardons the previous year while he was on vacation in Hawaii. Biden, meanwhile, signed a funding extension for federal aviation programs via autopen while he traveling to San Francisco in 2024, CNN reported at the time.
How often did Biden use an autopen?
That’s unclear. There is no official record of Biden's using an autopen for official government business.
Trump’s memorandum says, “The vast majority of Biden’s executive actions were signed using a mechanical signature pen, often called an autopen, as opposed to Biden’s own hand.”
Trump has offered no evidence to support the claims.
Has Trump used an autopen?
He has, but he maintains it wasn't for anything important.
Speaking to reporters on Air Force One in March, Trump at first said that “I never use” an autopen before he acknowledged that he had.
On Thursday, he said that ""I think it’s very disrespectful to people when they get an autopen signature"" but that he does use one to respond to letters. ""I'd like to do it myself,"" he said, but he added that he gets thousands of letters a week and it's ""not possible to do.""
What did Trump order with his new memo?
Trump's memo directs ""The Counsel to the President, in consultation with the Attorney General and the head of any other relevant executive department or agency (agency), shall investigate, to the extent permitted by law, whether certain individuals conspired to deceive the public about Biden’s mental state and unconstitutionally exercise the authorities and responsibilities of the President.""
It also orders a probe into ""the circumstances surrounding Biden’s supposed execution of numerous executive actions during his final years in office,"" including ""policy documents for which the autopen was used.""
Asked by NBC News whether he has any evidence that anything specific was signed without Biden’s knowledge or that someone in the Biden administration acting illegally, Trump said, “No, but I’ve uncovered, you know, the human mind.”
“I was in a debate with the human mind, and I don't think he knew what the hell he was doing,” he said Thursday, referring to his debate with Biden last year.
Did Trump request a criminal probe?
The Justice Department declined to comment when it was asked whether the investigation into the autopen issue is a criminal one. The White House counsel's office does not conduct criminal probes.
The House Oversight Committee is also investigating Republican allegations about Biden’s using the autopen.
“Who was making the decisions? Who was authorizing his signature? Was it him?” committee chair James Comer, R-Ky., asked last month.
Have the courts weighed in on autopens?
The Justice Department guidance from 2005 hasn’t been directly challenged in court, but a ruling last year involving presidential pardon powers lent some weight to the finding.
A unanimous decision by a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said presidents don’t have to issue written or signed pardons for them to be implemented.
“The plain language of the Constitution imposes no such limit, broadly providing that the President ‘shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.’ The constitutional text is thus silent as to any particular form the President’s clemency act must take to be effective,” the ruling said.
What is the source of the allegations?
While it's unclear how Trump came to seize on the allegations, right-wing media has focused on them for months, fueled in large part by a study from the conservative Heritage Foundation that accused the Biden administration of extensive autopen use, largely based on the timing of when Biden signed documents compared with when he was traveling.
Some of the findings also came from an analysis of the signatures in the Federal Register. A National Archives spokesperson told the fact-checking website Snopes in March: “At the beginning of each administration, the White House sends a sample of the President’s signature to the Federal Register, which uses it to create the graphic image for all Presidential Documents published in the Federal Register.”
What is the objective of Trump's order?
Trump's memorandum doesn’t give any indication of what might result from the investigation.
Trump has already revoked scores of Biden's executive actions — including about 80 on his first day in office — and he has suggested before that the use of an autopen could be used to challenge some of the pardons Biden issued.
“The ‘Pardons’ that Sleepy Joe Biden gave to the Unselect Committee of Political Thugs, and many others, are hereby declared VOID, VACANT, AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT, because of the fact that they were done by Autopen,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, referring to the pardons Biden gave to members of the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.
There's no evidence that Biden wasn't aware of those pardons — he'd discussed the possibility he would sign off on them in a Jan. 8 interview with USA Today and later issued a lengthy statement explaining why he'd signed them.
Can a president rescind a prior president's pardon?
While the Constitution give the president unique powers to issue pardons, it makes no provision for subsequent presidents to rescind them.
Jeffrey Crouch, a politics professor at American University and author of the book “The Presidential Pardon Power,” told NBC News in March that “Biden’s pardons are highly unlikely to be revoked somehow because of the apparent use of an autopen.”
What does Biden say about Trump's allegations?
In his statement Wednesday, Biden said, “Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations. Any suggestion that I didn’t is ridiculous and false.""

(AP) — Hundreds of people squeezed into the Jewish Community Center in Boulder, Colorado, for a vigil that featured prayer, singing and emotional testimony from a victim and witnesses of the firebombing attack in the city’s downtown, after a federal judge blocked the deportation of the suspect’s family. Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, has been charged with a federal hate crime and state counts of attempted murder in Sunday’s attack on a group demonstrating for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza. He is being held in a county jail on a $10 million cash bond and is scheduled to make an appearance in state court on Thursday afternoon. READ MORE: Immigration authorities detain family of man charged in Boulder attack Witnesses say Soliman threw two Molotov cocktails at the group and yelled “Free Palestine,” while authorities say he confessed to the attack that injured 15 people. Rachelle Halpern, who has been walking with the group since 2023, said during Wednesday evening’s vigil that she remembers thinking it was strange to see a man with a canister looking like he was going to spray pesticide on the grass. Then she heard a crash and screams and saw flames around her feet. “A woman stood one foot behind me, engulfed in flames from head to toe, lying on the ground with her husband,” she said. “People immediately, three or four men immediately rushed to her to smother the flames.” Her description prompted murmurs from the audience members. One woman’s head dropped into her hands. “I heard a loud noise, and the back of my legs burning, and don’t remember those next few moments,” said a victim, who didn’t want to be identified and spoke off camera, over the event’s speakers. “Even as I was watching it unfold before my eyes, even then, it didn’t seem real.” The attack unfolded against the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas war, which has contributed to a spike in antisemitic violence in the United States. It happened at the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot and barely a week after a man who also yelled “Free Palestine” was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli Embassy staffers outside a Jewish museum in Washington. Defendant’s family investigated U.S. District Judge Gordon P. Gallagher on Wednesday granted a request to block the deportation of Soliman’s wife and five children, who like Soliman are Egyptian. U.S. immigration officials took them into custody Tuesday, but they have not been charged in the attack. Federal authorities have said Soliman has been living in the U.S. illegally, and U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said Wednesday that the family was being processed for removal. It’s rare that a criminal suspect’s family members are detained and threatened with deportation.

Photo by Mark Makela/ Reuters Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin described the plaintiff’s claims as “absurd” and “an attempt to delay justice.” She said the entire family was in the country illegally. Soliman’s wife, Hayam El Gamal, a 17-year-old daughter, two minor sons and two minor daughters were being held at an immigration detention center in Texas, said Eric Lee, one of the attorney’s representing the family. Soliman told authorities that no one, including his family, knew he was planning an attack, according to court documents. El Gamal said she was “shocked” to learn her husband had been arrested in the attack, according to her lawsuit. Victims increase to 15 people and a dog On Wednesday, authorities raised the number of people injured in the attack to 15 from 12, plus a dog. Boulder County officials said in a news release that the victims include eight women and seven men ranging in age from 25 to 88. Details about how the victims were impacted would be explained in criminal charges set to be filed Thursday, according to Boulder County District Attorney’s office spokesperson Shannon Carbone. Soliman had planned to kill all of the roughly 20 participants in Sunday’s demonstration at the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall, but he threw just two of his 18 Molotov cocktails while yelling “Free Palestine,” police said. According to an FBI affidavit, Soliman told police he was driven by a desire “to kill all Zionist people” — a reference to the movement to establish and protect a Jewish state in Israel. Authorities said he expressed no remorse about the attack. The family’s immigration status Before moving to Colorado Springs three years ago, Soliman spent 17 years in Kuwait, according to court documents. He arrived in the U.S. in August 2022 on a tourist visa that expired in February 2023, McLaughlin said in a post on X. She said Soliman filed for asylum in September 2022 and was granted a work authorization in March 2023, but that has also expired. Hundreds of thousands of people overstay their visas each year in the United States, according to Department of Homeland Security reports. Soliman’s wife is an Egyptian national, according to her lawsuit. She is a network engineer and has a pending EB-2 visa, which is available to professionals with advanced degrees, the suit said. She and her children all are listed as dependents on Soliman’s asylum application. Golden reported from Seattle.

They may contain errors. Amna Nawaz: Several key Republican lawmakers share the concern about the impact the budget bill will have on the national debt. Geoff Bennett: Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson is among them.And I spoke with him earlier today.Senator Johnson, welcome back to the ""News Hour."" Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI): Thanks for having me on. Geoff Bennett: You have called this bill immoral. You have said it's grotesque, strong language. What specifically do you find so offensive about it? Sen. Ron Johnson: No, that's not how I refer to the bill. I have referred to the fact that we are mortgaging our children's future as immoral and grotesque, and then the level of debt that we have accumulated and that we continue to accumulate. So that is immoral.What we are doing to our children, how we are robbing them of the opportunities and diminishing their prospects, that's truly immoral. And we need to recognize that fact and we need to stop it. Geoff Bennett: Well, the Congressional Budget Office, as you well know, now estimates this bill would add $2.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade.The White House says that number is misleading and they say that you have your facts wrong. Here's what the press secretary said earlier this week: Question: But Republicans like Ron Johnson and Rand Paul disagree. They are saying that it will add to the deficit. That is their concern. Is the White House's position that those two Republican senators are — quote — ""blatantly wrong""? Karoline Leavitt, White House Press Secretary: It is. Those senators, it's not news that they disagree with this president on policy, and the president has vocally called them out for it and for not having their facts together. Geoff Bennett: So respond to that, if you will. Sen. Ron Johnson: Well, first of all, I met with the president at the White House yesterday with his economic advisers. They know I have my facts straight. We have got a lot of respect for each other.Now, I thought it was kind of interesting, in that White House meeting, one of the things that President Trump pointed out was, the Democrats are always unified. They're always united. And I pointed out to them, well, that's because they're doing the easy things. They're spending money we don't have. They're mortgaging our children's future.We're trying to do something hard. And I think the good news is that those of us who are trying to do something hard, we do respect each other. Listen, I'm a big supporter President Trump. I respect Speaker Johnson and leader Thune and Chairman Crapo.But we are trying to do something very hard. We have had an unprecedented level of spending increase since the start of COVID from $4.4 trillion to $7 trillion. Our deficits under Biden and the Democrats averaged $1.9 trillion per year. It's very difficult to dial that back.But, again, we're trying to do it. I recognize and I sympathize how difficult this is in the House, even in the Senate. I realize I'm kind of not one of the easiest gets here. But, again, my loyalty is to my children and grandchildren. And I believe that's — that is shared by the president and by the other leaders who are working on this enormously challenging problem. Geoff Bennett: So what needs to happen to get you to yes? Sen. Ron Johnson: So I have been pretty honest about this. I am up front.We need a commitment, I need a commitment to a reasonable pre-pandemic level of spending — don't expect that to happen overnight — and a process to achieve and maintain it. So that gives people pretty light wide latitude to satisfy what I'm trying to do.But the problem is severe. We're starting, according to the CBO projection — and that's what I'm focusing on. I'm not real fond of the CBO scores either. They're static. They're not dynamic. But their projection is pretty solid. I think you have to look at that. They're projecting $22 trillion of deficits over the next 10 years. That's an average of 2.2.Starts about $1.9 trillion up to about $2.5 trillion. It's completely unacceptable. We need to bend that deficit curve down toward a trajectory where we can balance our budget. Again, that's a hard thing to do. But I just need a commitment to that pre-pandemic level. And I want a process and a commitment to work with me to achieve that over the next the few years. Geoff Bennett: President Trump and Speaker Johnson have set a July 4 deadline to pass this bill. It's only a few weeks away.Is that timeline realistic? And what would potentially happen if you don't meet that deadline? Sen. Ron Johnson: Well, I think the skinnier we make this bill, the more realistic that timeline is. It's kind of hard to predict. I do believe that people like Senator Rick Scott and Mike Lee are working on different components with the chairmen of the committees.I think the bill actually will become better in the Senate. I think we will find additional spending reductions, help us solve that problem a little bit better. And, again, I'm working with the White House economic advisers, who are just first-class and very knowledgeable group of people. We want to get our numbers straight, so that nobody's disputing what the projections are, what the scores are, so we're all on the same page from that standpoint.And then we will move forward from that point. Geoff Bennett: Before we let you go, I want to ask you about a separate development, because President Trump today defended the executive order he signed last night imposing travel restrictions on more than a dozen countries, most of them in the Middle East and Africa.Do you support that move? And do you think that policy is necessary right now? Sen. Ron Johnson: I certainly support keeping America safe. Unfortunately, in the last administration, President Biden and his allies in — Democratic allies here in the House and Senate threw open our borders, allowing millions of people completely unvetted, members of transnational criminal organizations, violent gangs, drug human sex traffickers, into this country.President Trump has to clean up an enormous mess, and he's trying to prevent that mess from becoming even bigger. So, by and large, I support his actions. We have to secure our border. We have to protect Americans, make sure that Americans are kept safe. Geoff Bennett: Senator Ron Johnson, thanks for your time this evening. Sen. Ron Johnson: Have a great night.

They said the order seeks to “unilaterally coronate the President as the country’s chief election policymaker and administrator.” If the court does not halt the order, they argued, “the snowball of executive overreach will grow swiftly and exponentially.” Trump’s election directive was part of a flurry of executive orders he has issued in the opening months of his second term, many of which have drawn swift legal challenges.

It also would condition federal election grant funding on states adhering to the strict ballot deadline.

Planet-warming emissions dropped when companies had to report them.

The Trump administration's Environmental Protection Agency is taking aim at dozens of rules aimed at protecting the environment, including one that requires big polluters to report greenhouse gas emissions
LEOPOLD, Ind. -- On the ceiling of Abbie Brockman’s middle school English classroom in Perry County, the fluorescent lights are covered with images of a bright blue sky, a few clouds floating by.
Outside, the real sky isn’t always blue. Sometimes it’s hazy, with pollution drifting from coal-fired power plants in this part of southwest Indiana. Knowing exactly how much, and what it may be doing to the people who live there, is why Brockman got involved with a local environmental organization that’s installing air and water quality monitors in her community.
“Industry and government is very, very, very powerful. It’s more powerful than me. I’m just an English teacher,” Brockman said. But she wants to feel she can make a difference.
In a way, Brockman’s monitoring echoes the reporting that the Environmental Protection Agency began requiring from large polluters more than a decade ago. Emissions from four coal-fired plants in southwest Indiana have dropped 60% since 2010, when the rule took effect.
That rule is now on the chopping block, one of many that President Donald Trump’s EPA argues is costly and burdensome for industry.
But experts say dropping the requirement risks a big increase in emissions if companies are no longer publicly accountable for what they put in the air. And they say losing the data — at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere — would make it tougher to fight climate change.
At stake is the Greenhouse Gas Reporting program, a 2009 rule from President Barack Obama's administration that affects large carbon polluters like refineries, power plants, wells and landfills. In the years since, they've collectively reported a 20% drop in emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal plants.
And what happens at these big emitters makes a difference. Their declining emissions account for more than three-quarters of the overall, if modest, decline in all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions since 2010.
The registry includes places not usually thought of as big polluters but that have notable greenhouse gas emissions, such as college campuses, breweries and cereal factories. Even Walt Disney World in Florida, where pollution dropped 62% since 2010, has to report along with nearly 10,600 other places.
""We can’t solve climate change without knowing how much pollution major facilities are emitting and how that’s changing over time,"" said Jeremy Symons, a former EPA senior climate adviser now at Environmental Protection Network, an organization of ex-EPA officials that monitors environmental policies. The group provided calculations as a part of The Associated Press' analysis of impacts from proposed rule rollbacks.
Symons said some companies would welcome the end of the registry because it would make it easier to pollute.
It’s not clear how much the registry itself has contributed to declining emissions. More targeted regulations on smokestack emissions, as well as coal being crowded out by cheaper and less polluting natural gas, are bigger factors.
But the registry “does put pressure on companies to ... document what they’ve done or at least to provide a baseline for what they’ve done,” said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who heads Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tally national carbon emissions yearly.
Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator under Obama, said the registry makes clear how power plants are doing against each other, and that's an inducement to lower emissions.
""It is money for those companies. It's costs. It's reputation. It's been, I think, a wonderful success story and I hope it continues.”
The potential end of the reporting requirement comes as experts say much of the country's air goes unmonitored. Nelson Arley Roque, a Penn State professor who co-authored a study in April on these “monitoring deserts,” said about 40% of U.S. lands are unmonitored. That often includes poor and rural neighborhoods.
""The air matters to all of us, but apparently 50 million people can’t know or will never know'' how bad the air is, Roque said.
The EPA is also trying to claw back money that had been earmarked for air monitoring, part of the termination of grants that it has labeled as targeting diversity, equity and inclusion. That includes $500,000 that would have funded 40 air monitors in a low-income and minority community in the Charlotte, North Carolina, area.
CleaneAIRE NC, a nonprofit that works to improve air quality across the state that was awarded the grant, is suing.
“It’s not diversity, equity and inclusion. It’s human rights,” said Daisha Wall, the group's community science program manager. “We all deserve a right to clean air.”
Research strongly links poor air quality to diseases like asthma and heart disease, with a slightly less established link to cancer. Near polluting industries, experts say what’s often lacking is either enough data in specific locations or the will to investigate the health toll.
Indiana says it “maintains a robust statewide monitoring and assessment program for air, land and water,” but Brockman and others in this part of the state aren’t satisfied. They’re installing their own air and water quality monitors. It’s a full-time job to keep the network of monitors up and running, fighting spotty Wi-Fi and connectivity issues.
Fighting industry is a sensitive subject, Brockman added. Many families depend on jobs at coal-fired power plants, and poverty is real. She keeps snacks in her desk for the kids who haven’t eaten breakfast.
“But you also don’t want to hear of another student that has a rare cancer,” she said.

""That injunction effectively appoints the district court to a Cabinet role and bars the Executive Branch from terminating anyone, even though respondents conceded that some other [reductions in force] would plainly be proper,"" the SCOTUS filing reads.
On Wednesday, a federal appeals court declined to lift a judge’s order blocking President Donald Trump from carrying out his executive order that would shut down the department, according to Reuters. In the executive order, which was issued in March, Trump asserted that ""closing the Department of Education would provide children and their families the opportunity to escape a system that is failing them.""
FEDERAL APPEALS COURT THROWS ROADBLOCK AT TRUMP'S EDUCATION REFORM AGENDA
U.S. District Judge Myong Joun initially blocked the Trump administration’s attempt to dismantle the DOE in May. The ruling stopped a mass firing at the DOE that was announced in March and ordered the reinstatement of those who have been fired.
The DOE quickly rejected Joun’s ruling, with Deputy Assistant Secretary of the DOE’s Office of Communications and Outreach Madi Biedermann saying, ""President Trump and the Senate-confirmed Secretary of Education clearly have the authority to make decisions about agency reorganization efforts, not an unelected Judge with a political axe to grind. This ruling is not in the best interest of American students or families. We will immediately challenge this on an emergency basis.""
Trump made it clear that he would seek to restructure and even dismantle the DOE during his second term in office. In fact, when he nominated Education Secretary Linda McMahon, he said her goal should be to ""put herself out of a job."" The president cited poor performance as one of his reasons for seeking to shut down the DOE.
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DESIGNATES JUNE AS 'TITLE IX MONTH' AMID TRANSGENDER ATHLETE DEBATE
The Nation’s Report Card, which assesses how American students are performing in various subjects, showed seven out of 10 fourth graders are not proficient readers, which is a worse score than the last report card in 2022. The report card noted that reading scores showed ""no significant change"" since 1992.
The administration has faced both political and legal pushback on its quest to get rid of the department. In February, several Democrats attempted to enter the Department of Education building in D.C., but were blocked by an employee.
During the incident in February, Democrats repeatedly slammed the Trump administration and accused it of lacking transparency.

A Japanese court has ruled former executives at the utility managing the tsunami-wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant were not accountable for the 2011 meltdown crisis and do not need to pay damages to the company
TOKYO -- A Japanese court ruled former executives at the utility managing the tsunami-wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant were not accountable for the 2011 meltdown crisis and do not need to pay damages to the company.
The Tokyo High Court ruling on Friday reversed a lower court decision in 2022 ordering four former executives of the Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings to pay 13 trillion yen ($90 billion) to the company, saying they had failed to take the utmost safety precautions despite knowing the risks of a serious accident in a major tsunami.
A magitude 9.0 earthquake and tsunami in March 2011 destroyed key cooling systems at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, causing its three reactors to melt down, spreading large amounts of radiation in the area and keeping tens of thousands of residents from returning home due to radioactive contamination and other safety concerns.
The Tokyo District Court ruling three years ago was the only ruling that held the former TEPCO liable for the Fukushima disaster. It upheld the plaintiffs' argument that the executives had neglected to heed experts’ long-term tsunami predictions and failed to take adequate tsunami precaution measures soon enough.
The court said, however, the long-term tsunani prediction was not considered pressing data requiring immediate tsunami measures and it was understandable the executives had no sense of urgency from the data they had at that time, Kyodo News reported.
Friday’s ruling is a major disappointment for Fukushima residents and anti-nuclear activists seeking the managements’ responsibility in nuclear safety.
Plaintiffs and their lawyers criticized the ruling as “unjust” and said they planned to appeal to the Supreme Court.
Hiroyuki Kawai, a plaintiffs' lawyer, criticized the ruling as “logically flawed,"" saying it means nobody can be held liable for any safety negligence because tsunami and earthquake predictions are still impossible today.
A group of more than 40 TEPCO shareholders filed the lawsuit in 2012 demanding five former executives pay the company 22 trillion yen ($153 billion) in damages. The amount of the 2022 ruling against four of the executives was the highest ever ordered in a lawsuit.
Japan's top court in March found two former TEPCO executives not guilty of negligence over the Fukushima meltdowns, saying a tsunami of the magnitude that hit the plant was unforeseeable.

As charges linger over Landry, Louisiana Legislature passes dramatic changes to ethics law

Louisiana lawmakers overwhelmingly approved a set of dramatic changes to state ethics laws Wednesday that will make it much more difficult to charge elected officials and public employees with misconduct.
House Bill 674 alters the process the state ethics board used to bring charges against Gov. Jeff Landry two years ago that are still pending.
Landry’s charges won’t be affected by the legislation, but he pushed for the bill and is expected to let it pass into law. The governor’s personal attorney, Stephen Gelé, helped craft the language contained in it.
Beyond making it harder to bring ethics charges, the legislation also loosens limits on elected officials’ and state employees’ state travel, weakens restrictions on government contracts with public servants and their families, and reduces requirements for elected officials and political candidates’ disclosure of financial interests.
The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Beau Beaullieu, R-New Iberia, said it is a reaction to the ethics board’s overzealous enforcement that has frustrated officials in both parties. The anger toward the board was reflected in lawmakers’ overwhelming support of the bill.
The Louisiana Senate and House voted 34-2 and 92-1, respectively, for the ethics overhaul this week.
The votes came after ethics board members expressed concerns about the bill during their May meeting. Its top staff member, Ethics Administrator David Bordelon, described it as “skewing” the ethics investigation process in favor of the person accused of wrongdoing.
The state’s preeminent government watchdog group, the Public Affairs Research Council of Louisiana (PAR), also vociferously opposed the legislation.
“This is designed to make sure we don’t have ethics investigations,” PAR President Steven Procopio told lawmakers at a hearing last week.
The changes to the ethics board’s enforcement mechanisms affects a wide range of public servants, lobbyists and government contractors. The incoming laws will apply to every elected officer and public employee in state and local government – from a local librarian to the governor.
The bill becomes law in about three weeks or whenever the governor signs it, whichever comes first.
New barriers to enforcement
Once enacted, the legislation will create a loophole in the law that might allow any public official, government contractor or lobbyist to block ethics investigations by requesting an advisory opinion on their potential misconduct from the ethics board.
The bill prohibits the ethics board from bringing charges based on information that a person includes in their advisory opinion request, which could allow someone to protect themselves against charges by submitting such a document. If the board suspects there was ethical misconduct based on the advisory opinion request, it won’t be able to act on it anymore.
The board will also have to reach a higher standard to refer a matter for investigation. It will have to find “probable cause,” a legal standard that requires the board to have established it is likely a violation has occurred without the investigation being conducted, said Kathleen Allen, the state’s former ethics administrator who retired in December after 16 years.
“Also, it could open the Board up to litigation challenging its decision to refer a matter to investigation,” wrote Allen in a text Wednesday.
The ethics board will have far less time to investigate and decide whether to bring charges in cases. Under current law, the board has a year to act once an investigation is launched. The legislation would add several more steps to that process by allowing the subject of the complaint to object and respond to accusations more often during the board’s deliberations.
“They are lopping off a couple of months, minimum,” ethics board member Alfred “Butch” Speer, an appointee of former Gov. John Bel Edwards, said at a May meeting.
“If [the persons being investigated] drag their feet long enough, then we run out of time,” he added.
Governor’s influence
Once the bill becomes law, the governor will also have significantly more influence over whether charges are ever brought against someone.
The ethics board will now need to vote with a two-thirds majority multiple times in order for an investigation and charges against a person to go forward.
Following changes Landry pushed last year, the governor now controls nine of the 15 votes on the board. This means investigations and charges can’t proceed unless four of the governor’s appointees vote multiple times in favor of them.
Plane travel from political donors
Another portion of Beaullieu’s legislation targets the issue that got Landry in trouble with the ethics board – private plane travel. It eases restrictions on legislators’ travel for state business on private planes that political donors or outside organizations provide.
Legislators were previously only allowed to accept flights on private planes for public speeches if they were traveling within the United States or Canada. Once the new law takes effect, they will be able to accept private plane travel for government business anywhere in North America or the U.S. territories, including locations in the Caribbean, as long as they are making a public speech, participating in a panel discussion or making a media appearance.
More restrictions possible
Lawmakers are also close to passing a second piece of legislation that would place even more limitations on ethics complaints.
House Bill 160 by Rep, Kellee Hennessy Dickerson, R-Denham Springs, would require the identities of people who provide tips to the ethics board to be revealed to the person accused of misconduct, Currently, the board keeps this information confidential.
People who don’t pay to produce a “sworn” complaint – one made under legal oath attesting to the truthfulness of the allegations – would have to deliver their “non-sworn” complaint to the ethics board staff in person at their office in downtown Baton Rouge, even if they live hundreds of miles away.
Dickerson also wants to limit materials the ethics board can use to launch an investigation and bring charges solely to complaints and reports state agencies or officials produce. Currently, the board also regularly pursues investigations based on media reports.
Dickerson said she is bringing the legislation based on her personal experience with the ethics board, which fined her $1,500 in 2023.
Public employees are prohibited from being paid for outside work by their agency. The ethics board concluded Dickerson, when she was a member of the Livingston Parish School Board, helped a teacher get paid tens of thousands of extra dollars from the high school where he was works for removing trees and doing some light construction work at the school.
Dickerson said she was only reported to the ethics board because she was in a contentious election for her state representative seat that year.
“It’s a very chilling process,” she said at a legislative hearing Wednesday of the ethics board’s deliberations. “It’s a very derogatory process once the complaint has been made.”
Dickerson’s bill has already passed the House and only needs approval by the Senate and Landry to become law. The legislative session ends June 12.

After former LSU President William Tate abruptly departed campus for the same job at Rutgers University in New Jersey, political forces began jockeying to posture their preferred replacements to take the prized office.
LSU’s faculty will expect Tate’s replacement to have an academic background, including the highest degree, a body of research and time as a faculty member. But politically-appointed university board members are mulling names without this pedigree, including those at the highest echelons of elected office in Louisiana.
Before the LSU Board of Supervisors can take action on a replacement, two questions must be settled: Will Tate, who served as both president of the LSU System and chancellor of the Baton Rouge campus, be replaced by one person or two? And what kind of search will the board undertake?
Earlier this year, two board members confirmed to the Illuminator the possibility of splitting the president and chancellor roles is being discussed. The two positions were combined in 2012. The uncertainty could impact the pool of candidates, as some applicants might not want to take a job that could be split in two.
The effort to split the job is spearheaded by LSU Board Vice Chairman Lee Mallett, a Republican mega-donor from Lake Charles. He said the combined roles have not served the university well.
“We’ve tried it for over a decade, and I believe the results speak for themselves,” Mallett said in an emailed statement. “When a university is large, complex, and multifaceted, leadership must be distributed.”
LSU Board Chairman Scott Ballard, who was a member of the board in 2012 when the merger occurred, is generally opposed to splitting the roles again. He said in an interview he might consider dividing the jobs as “there may be a reason to,” though he did not elaborate on what that reason would be.
Ballard said the board will soon announce a search committee, which he predicted would work over the next six months or so to conduct a nationwide search for Tate’s replacement. Such a move could ease fears among some faculty who thought the board might choose and coronate a successor without their input.
Though Tate’s successor could very well be a top administrator at an out-of-state university, there are some in-state names circulating.
GET THE MORNING HEADLINES.
Matt Lee
Matt Lee, LSU’s vice president for agriculture and dean of its College of Agriculture, currently serves as interim president while the search plays out. An academic with an aptitude for politics, he could be seen as the compromise candidate.
Lee got his Ph.D. from LSU before joining the faculty at Mississippi State for five years, after which he returned to LSU. In Baton Rouge, he earned the rank of full professor before making the jump to administration.
Lee’s work as a sociologist has mostly focused on crime, and his publications have touched on Louisiana themes, including the aftermath of the BP-Deepwater Horizon oil spill and Hurricane Katrina.
Lee previously served as interim provost before Tate ultimately hired Roy Haggerty, who is also on his way out to take the same job at Oregon State University. Though being made vice president for agriculture might have been a consolation prize, the position better serves him if his goal is to replace Tate.
Lee has not responded to questions about whether he intends to apply for the job.
Leading the LSU AgCenter, which has a presence in all 64 parishes — and by extension, every legislative district — means Lee has had the opportunity to form connections with lawmakers and other public officials.
His political clout, his academic pedigree and his general affability could make him the choice who would make the most people happy.
Wade Rousse
Wade Rousse has served as president of McNeese State in Lake Charles for just over a year. Before taking the job, he had worked several other administrative jobs at the school since 2019.
Rousse is the candidate favored by Mallett, who is a Lake Charles resident.
“Dr. Rousse will stand on his own two feet,” Mallett said. “If he chooses to enter this process, I am confident in his ability to rise to the top based on merit, leadership, and qualifications.”
In an emailed comment, Rousse did not confirm or deny his interest in the position.
“While I am flattered that my name was mentioned as a candidate for its presidency, I remain laser-focused on building on our successes at McNeese State, where we have right-sized the university, stabilized our finances and reversed a 14-year enrollment decline,” Rousse said.
While Rousse has a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Illinois Chicago and some experience as an adjunct professor, he does not have the typical academic background expected of the president of a major research institution. And with just one year of experience running a regional university — with very different goals than an institution that spends over $500 million annually on research —- higher education observers question whether his administrative knowledge is enough to make up for his lack of academic experience.
Julia Letlow
U.S. Rep. Julia Letlow, R-Start, is rumored to be the most-favored political candidate for the job.
Letlow has represented Louisiana’s 5th Congressional district since 2021. Her district was redrawn in 2024 to include LSU, where she held her re-election victory party last year.
Letlow has a Ph.D. in communications from South Florida University and worked in administrative jobs at the University of Louisiana at Monroe before joining Congress. A finalist for the ULM presidency in 2020, she was passed over for Ronald Berry.
In remarks to students visiting her during Washington Mardi Gras earlier this year, Letlow described applying for the job as one of the most terrifying experiences of her life.
“It was horrible and the faculty were terrible to me,” Letlow said. “I didn’t get it, and that was so good … because it was preparing me for the next step.”
Letlow spokesman Matt Smith declined to comment for this story.
Like McNeese, UL-Monroe is a regional non-research university. While Letlow might have the favor of the political class, the fact she was passed over for that job raises questions for faculty as to what makes her qualified to lead a much larger, much more research-focused institution.
That could change if the LSU board ends up splitting the two jobs. While faculty would be unlikely to back Letlow for chancellor, she wouldn’t necessarily need to win their support to be successful as the system president, which is a much more political and administrative position.
YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.
Bill Cassidy
U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-Baton Rouge, is another rumored political pick for the job. He is currently in a fight for his political life in next year’s election after voting to convict President Donald Trump for his actions in the attempted insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021.
Though Cassidy might find an easy out — and a much higher paycheck — leading his alma mater, he said in an interview that he’s focused on re-election.
A two-time LSU graduate, Cassidy is a physician and was on its medical school faculty for many years before starting his political career.
The theory of Cassidy as a potential successor is predicated on the idea that getting Cassidy out of the U.S. Senate race would be a political boon for Trump-aligned conservatives who want to replace him with a more favorable Republican.
The desired political domino effect is not unprecedented in Louisiana higher education. Just last year, Gov. Jeff Landry threw his support behind state Supreme Court Justice Jimmy Genovese to become president of Northwestern State University. That allowed a Landry-backed candidate to run and win Genovese’s seat on the high court.
Other rumored names
Though they were both finalists for the job in 2021, former Lt. Gov. Jay Dardenne and current Louisiana Tech President Jim Henderson are very unlikely to enter the fray again.
While Dardenne is a Republican, his endorsement of former democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Landry foe, and a subsequent eight years of service as Edwards’ budget chief, makes him a non-starter with the Landry-controlled LSU Board of Supervisors. If his political disadvantage wasn’t enough, Dardenne’s lack of an academic background also puts him at odds with faculty expectations.
Dardenne is a two time LSU graduate, earning his undergraduate in mass communications and a J.D. from the Law Center.
Though he was passed over for the job previously, Dardenne, who was previously LSU student body president and a student member on the board of supervisors, has remained ubiquitous at LSU events, always dressed in purple and gold. That is unlikely to change.
Henderson served as president of the University of Louisiana System from 2017-23 and has been president of Louisiana Tech since then. He laughed when contacted about the possibility of him succeeding Tate and said he was happy where he is.
Though Henderson has experience running a research institution and plenty of political allies, his candidacy would come at the same time LSU is taking back control of the fiscally embattled University of New Orleans from the University of Louisiana System. That could prompt uncomfortable questions for Henderson about his knowledge of the crisis when he led the UL System.
And though he has a doctor of management from the University of Maryland, Henderson is not an academic and has never held a faculty job. He was also handed the Tech job under unusual circumstances, without a search committee or faculty feedback. Both factors could impact his standing in the eyes of LSU faculty.

A federal investigation has found that a Texas hospital that repeatedly sent a woman who was bleeding and in pain home without ending her nonviable, life-threatening pregnancy violated the law
WASHINGTON -- A Texas hospital that repeatedly sent a woman who was bleeding and in pain home without ending her nonviable, life-threatening pregnancy violated the law, according to a newly released federal investigation.
The government's findings, which have not been previously reported, were a small victory for 36-year-old Kyleigh Thurman, who ultimately lost part of her reproductive system after being discharged without any help from her hometown emergency room for her dangerous ectopic pregnancy.
But a new policy the Trump administration announced on Tuesday has thrown into doubt the federal government's oversight of hospitals that deny women emergency abortions, even when they are at risk for serious infection, organ loss or severe hemorrhaging.
Thurman had hoped the federal government's investigation, which issued a report in April after concluding its inquiry last year, would send a clear message that ectopic pregnancies must be treated by hospitals in Texas, which has one of the nation's strictest abortion bans.
“I didn’t want anyone else to have to go through this,” Thurman said in an interview with the Associated Press from her Texas home this week. “I put a lot of the responsibility on the state of Texas and policy makers and the legislators that set this chain of events off.”
Women around the country have been denied emergency abortions for their life-threatening pregnancies after states swiftly enacted abortion restrictions in response to a 2022 ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court, which includes three appointees of President Donald Trump.
The guidance issued by the Biden administration in 2022 was an effort to preserve access to emergency abortions for extreme cases in which women were experiencing medical emergencies. It directed hospitals — even ones in states with severe restrictions — to provide abortions in those emergency cases. If hospitals did not comply, they would be in violation of a federal law and risk losing some federal funds.
On Tuesday, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency responsible for enforcing the law and inspecting hospitals, announced it would revoke the Biden-era guidance around emergency abortions.
The law, which requires doctors to provide stabilizing treatment, was one of the few ways that Thurman was able to hold the emergency room accountable after she didn't receive any help from staff at Ascension Seton Williamson in Round Rock, Texas in February of 2023, a few months after Texas enacted its strict abortion ban.
Emergency room staff observed that Thurman's hormone levels had dropped, a pregnancy was not visible in her uterus and a structure was blocking her fallopian tube — all telltale signs of an ectopic pregnancy, when a fetus implants outside of the uterus and has no room to grow. If left untreated, ectopic pregnancies can rupture, causing organ damage, hemorrhage or even death.
Thurman, however, was sent home and given a pamphlet on miscarriage for her first pregnancy. She returned three days later, still bleeding, and was given an injected drug intended to end the pregnancy, but it was too late. Days later, she showed up again at the emergency room, bleeding out because the fertilized egg growing on Thurman’s fallopian tube ruptured it. She underwent an emergency surgery that removed part of her reproductive system.
CMS launched its investigation of how Ascension Seton Williamson handled Thurman’s case late last year, shortly after she filed a complaint. Investigators concluded the hospital failed to give her a proper medical screening exam, including an evaluation with an OB-GYN. The hospital violated the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, which requires emergency rooms to provide stabilizing treatment to all patients. Thurman was “at risk for deterioration of her health and wellbeing as a result of an untreated medical condition,” the investigation said in its report, which was publicly released last month.
Ascension, a vast hospital system that has facilities across multiple states, did not respond to questions about Thurman’s case, saying only that it is “is committed to providing high-quality care to all who seek our services.”
Doctors and legal experts have warned abortion restrictions like the one Texas enacted have discouraged emergency room staff from aborting dangerous and nonviable pregnancies, even when a woman's life is imperiled. The stakes are especially high in Texas, where doctors face up to 99 years in prison if convicted of performing an illegal abortion. Lawmakers in the state are weighing a law that would remove criminal penalties for doctors who provide abortions in certain medical emergencies.
“We see patients with miscarriages being denied care, bleeding out in parking lots. We see patients with nonviable pregnancies being told to continue those to term,” said Molly Duane, an attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights that represented Thurman. “This is not, maybe, what some people thought abortion bans would look like, but this is the reality.”
The Biden administration routinely warned hospitals that they need to provide abortions when a woman’s health was in jeopardy, even suing Idaho over its state law that initially prohibited nearly all abortions, unless a woman’s life was on the line.
But CMS’ announcement on Tuesday raises questions about whether such investigations will continue if hospitals do not provide abortions for women in medical emergencies.
The agency said it will still enforce the law, “including for identified emergency medical conditions that place the health of a pregnant woman or her unborn child in serious jeopardy.”
While states like Texas have clarified that ectopic pregnancies can legally be treated with abortions, the laws do not provide for every complication that might arise during a pregnancy. Several women in Texas have sued the state for its law, which has prevented women from terminating pregnancies in cases where their fetuses had deadly fetal anomalies or they went into labor too early for the fetus to survive.
Thurman worries pregnant patients with serious complications still won't be able to get the help they may need in Texas emergency rooms.
“You cannot predict the ways a pregnancy can go,” Thurman said. “It can happen to anyone, still. There’s still so many ways in which pregnancies that aren’t ectopic can be deadly.”",ABC News,['oversight'],"['Texas', 'Texas', 'WASHINGTON', 'Texas', 'Kyleigh Thurman', 'Trump', 'Thurman', 'Texas', 'Thurman', 'the Associated Press', 'Texas', 'Texas', 'the U.S. Supreme Court', 'Donald Trump', 'Biden', 'the Centers for Medicare', 'Medicaid Services', 'Biden', 'Thurman', 'Ascension Seton Williamson', 'Round Rock', 'Texas', 'Texas', 'Thurman', 'Thurman', 'Thurman', 'CMS', 'Ascension Seton Williamson', 'Thurman', 'Thurman', 'Thurman', 'Texas', 'Texas', 'Molly Duane', 'the Center for Reproductive Rights', 'Thurman', 'Biden', 'CMS', 'Texas', 'Texas', 'Thurman', 'Texas', 'Thurman', 'n’t']",
UN nuclear agency members draft resolution accusing Iran of failing to meet obligations,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/nuclear-agency-members-draft-resolution-accusing-iran-failing-122548703,"Thu, 05 Jun 2025 14:38:00 -0400","Western nations are planning to table a resolution at an IAEA meeting that will find Iran in non-compliance with its so-called safeguards obligations for the first time in 20 years, a senior western diplomat said","UN nuclear agency members draft resolution accusing Iran of failing to meet obligations
Western nations are planning to table a resolution at an IAEA meeting that will find Iran in non-compliance with its so-called safeguards obligations for the first time in 20 years, a senior western diplomat said
VIENNA -- Western nations are planning to table a resolution at a meeting of the U.N.’s nuclear agency that will find Iran in non-compliance with its so-called safeguards obligations for the first time in 20 years, a senior western diplomat said Thursday.
The move comes at a sensitive time as U.S. President Donald Trump's administration seeks to reach a deal with Tehran to limit its nuclear program. The two sides have held several rounds of talks, so far without agreement.
A draft resolution, jointly tabled by France, the U.K. and Germany, known as the E3, together with the United States, was circulated today after a final sign-off by Washington.
The State Department did not immediately comment.
The draft resolution, which was seen by The Associated Press, says: “Iran’s many failures to uphold its obligations since 2019 to provide the Agency with full and timely cooperation regarding undeclared nuclear material and activities at multiple undeclared locations in Iran ... constitutes non-compliance with its obligations under its Safeguards Agreement.”
The draft resolution furthermore finds that the IAEA's “inability ... to provide assurance that Iran’s nuclear programme is exclusively peaceful gives rise to questions that are within the competence of the United Nations Security Council, as the organ bearing the main responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.”
It requests IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi “to continue his efforts to implement this and previous resolutions and to report again, including any further developments on the issues.""
The text of the draft may change before it is formally tabled, as board members have the opportunity to suggest amendments.
Under the so-called safeguards obligations, that are part of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Iran is legally bound to declare all nuclear material and activities and allow IAEA inspectors to verify that none of it is being diverted from peaceful uses.
In the IAEA’s “comprehensive report” that was circulated among members states last weekend, the U.N. nuclear watchdog said that Iran’s cooperation with the agency has “been less than satisfactory” when it comes to uranium traces discovered by agency inspectors at several locations in Iran that Tehran has failed to declare as nuclear sites.
The IAEA has been seeking answers from Iran regarding the origin and current location of the nuclear material since 2019.
Western officials suspect that the uranium traces discovered by the IAEA could provide evidence that Iran had a secret nuclear weapons program until 2003.
Iran denies ever having had a nuclear weapons program and says its program is entirely peaceful.
The senior western diplomat called the resolution a “serious step,” but added that western nations are “not closing the door to diplomacy on this issue.”
“The objective of the resolution is for Iran to resolve the issue,” the source added, which is why the resolution will not immediately refer Iran’s non-compliance to the U.N. Security Council to consider triggering more sanctions. “They will have a window to finally comply and respond to all the requests that have been made over the last six years.”
The board of governors “stresses its support for a diplomatic solution to the problems posed by the Iranian nuclear programme, leading to an agreement that addresses all international concerns related to Iran’s nuclear activities, encouraging all parties to constructively engage in diplomacy,” the draft resolution reads.
However, if Iran fails to cooperate, an extraordinary IAEA board meeting will likely be held in the summer, during which another resolution could get passed that will refer the issue to the Security Council, the senior diplomat said.
The three European nations have threatened in the past to reinstate sanctions that have been lifted under the original 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which expires on Oct. 18.
Iran has previously retaliated to resolutions passed by the agency's board by further expanding its nuclear program and banning inspectors.
Iranian deputy foreign minister Kazem Gharibabadi warned the IAEA against taking any “politically-motivated action” by some board members, as this could undermine cooperation between Iran and the UN nuclear watchdog, he wrote in a post on X.

ICE Strands Migrants in Djibouti After Failing to Send Them to South Sudan,https://truthout.org/articles/ice-strands-migrants-in-djibouti-after-failing-to-send-them-to-south-sudan/,"Fri, 06 Jun 2025 18:03:37 +0000",Migrants and ICE agents are being forced to live in shipping containers on a US military base in hazardous conditions.,"The Trump administration could have sent eight migrants with deportation orders and the immigration agents who were escorting them to a facility in the U.S. after a federal judge recently barred officials from deporting them to war-torn South Sudan, where they could face persecution or torture.
Instead the administration sent them to U.S. Naval Base Camp Lemonnier in the East African country of Djibouti, where a court filing on Thursday said they face illness, the threat of rocket fire from nearby Yemen, temperatures that soar past 100°F daily, and rancid smoke from nearby burn pits where human waste and trash are incinerated.
Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, blamed U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy for “stranding” the 13 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and eight detainees at the naval base, where they have been housed since late May in a metal shipping container converted into a conference room with just six bunk beds.
The administration has frequently attacked judges for issuing rulings that have interfered with President Donald Trump’s ability to carry out his anti-immigration agenda.
But Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, pointed to court transcripts that showed the Trump administration had requested the migrants and agents be sent to Camp Lemonnier.
“No one asked them to do and no court order forces them to do it,” said Reichlin-Melnick Thursday.
In a court transcript, Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign told Murphy that “bringing them back would be a much broader remedy than necessary” and suggested the detainees could have a “reasonable fear interview where they are” in Djibouti to determine if they had a credible fear of persecution or torture if they were deported. Murphy had instructed officials to arrange reasonable fear interviews when he ruled in May that they could not be sent to South Sudan.
“The judge did NOT require that anyone be ‘stranded’ anywhere,” said Reichlin-Melnick. “In fact, it was the Trump administration that asked the judge for permission to hold the men in Djibouti! ICE could literally bring the men to any other U.S. base (or back to the U.S.) at any time!”
Murphy’s ruling in May interrupted a deportation flight carrying the migrants — who have been convicted of crimes and are from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, South Sudan, and Vietnam — to South Sudan.
The judge said the flight violated his previous order from April 18, which prohibited the administration from sending immigrants to third countries without providing them a chance to request humanitarian protections. That ruling was underpinned by the Convention Against Torture, which bars governments from deporting people to countries where they could be face torture.
“The judge gave the government a choice as to how to remedy the government’s violation of the court’s order — either return them and comply with the order in the United States or comply with the order overseas,” Trina Realmuto, a lawyer for the immigrants, told The Intercept. “The government opted to comply overseas after telling the court that they had the ability to do so. This is a situation the government both created and can remedy if it so chooses.”
The court filing on Thursday by Mellissa Harper of the Office of Refugee Resettlement described how within 72 hours of arriving at the makeshift detention facility in Djibouti, the agents and migrants began to suffer from symptoms for bacterial respiratory infections, including “coughing, difficulty breathing, fever, and achy joints.”
The filing explained that they are unable to get tested to determine what the illness is, and there is only a small supply of inhalers, Tylenol, eye drops, and nasal spray to treat the symptoms.
Based on what was described, Politico’s Kyle Cheney asked: “Why is the Trump administration forcing them to stay there?”
“ICE’s claims of difficulties here are ENTIRELY self-inflicted,” said Reichlin-Melnick. “THEY asked the judge for permission to hold the men in Djibouti. The plaintiffs wanted the men brought back here. I have sympathy for the low-level officers stuck there, but it’s ALL their bosses’ fault.”
The administration has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stay Murphy’s order requiring screenings for the migrants, claiming that ruling violated officials’ authority to deport immigrants to third countries if their home countries won’t take them back.
But in the case of at least one of the migrants, Jesus Munoz Gutierrez, the government of his home country of Mexico was not informed that he had been sent to Djibouti.
Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum suggested last month that Gutierrez could be repatriated if U.S. followed protocols to send him back to Mexico.
Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director for Detention Watch Network, told Newsweek that the administration’s insistence on detaining the migrants in a shipping container at Camp Lemonniere is “the latest move in Trump’s shocking expansion of third country deportations.”
“By expelling people out of sight and out of mind to remote prisons and war-torn, unstable countries,” said Ghandehari, “the Trump regime is attempting to normalize the offshoring of immigration detention and third country deportations as a new and expanded model of incarceration and deportation.”
Ghandehari added that “the use of shipping containers to detain people is heinous and enraging — and coupled with the extreme heat, disease, and threats of rocket attacks in Djibouti, can be deadly.”

Here’s a recap of what happened this morning.
Russia attacked Ukraine with Russian ballistic missiles and drones during a nighttime attack early on Friday, wounding at least three people, officials said.
Multiple explosions were heard in Kyiv, the capital, and falling debris triggered fires across several districts as air defence systems tried to intercept incoming targets, said the Kyiv city administration’s head, Tymur Tkachenko.
Authorities reported damage in several districts and rescue workers were responding at multiple locations. Officials urged residents to seek shelter.
The attacks came after Russia accused Kyiv of state terrorism over its drone operation striking Russian heavy bomber planes at air bases in Siberia and the far north at the weekend and said it would respond as and when its military saw fit.
In Friday’s Russian attacks a fire broke out in a 16-story residential building in Kyiv’s Solomyanskyi district and emergency services evacuated three people from the apartment. Rescue operations were continuing. Another fire broke out in a metal warehouse.
A Shahed drone exploded near an apartment building in Ukraine’s northern Chernihiv region, shattering windows and doors, the regional military administration chief said. Explosions from ballistic missiles were also recorded on the city’s outskirts, Dmytro Bryzhynskyi added.
US president Donald Trump said that during a call with Vladimir Putin on Wednesday he urged the Russian president to refrain from retaliating but fully expected Moscow to strike back over Ukraine’s assault on Russian heavy bomber planes.
The UN nuclear safety watchdog’s team at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine heard repeated rounds of gunfire that appeared to be aimed at drones reportedly attacking the site’s training centre, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency said on Thursday. There were no immediate reports of damage to the centre, it said.
German chancellor Friedrich Merz urged Trump in an Oval Office meeting to increase pressure on Russia to end the war.
North Korean leader Kim Jong-un vowed to “unconditionally support” Russia in the war at a meeting with top Russian security official Sergei Shoigu, Pyongyang state media reported. With agencies
Looking back at the lead-up to Russia’s assault on Ukraine this morning, Moscow had vowed to respond to Ukraine’s drone operation “how and when” it saw fit, amid reports that Vladimir Putin had told Donald Trump that Moscow was obliged to retaliate.
Ukraine had been bracing for retaliation after its SBU security service carried out a surprise drone strike over the weekend targeting four airbases and damaging up to 20 Russian warplanes deep inside the country, according to US officials, Andrew Roth and Pjotr Sauer have reported.
The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, was asked on Thursday what Moscow’s response would be and said:
How and when our military deems it appropriate.
Trump said Putin had “strongly” told him during their unannounced call on Wednesday that Russia would respond to the recent attacks on its airfields.
The US embassy in Ukraine warned of a continuing risk of “significant airstrikes” and advised its citizens to exercise caution.
Hours after Trump and Putin spoke, Russia launched a series of missiles and drones across Ukraine, killing at least five people in the northern city of Pryluky.
At least three wounded in missile and drone attack on Kyiv – officials
Ballistics missiles are also involved in Russia’s ongoing attack on Kyiv and at least three people have been wounded, officials say.
“Our air defense crews are doing everything possible,” Tymur Tkachenko, head of the Kyiv city administration, said on Telegram. “But we must protect one another — stay safe.”
Authorities reported damage in several districts and rescue workers were responding at multiple locations, the Associated Press reports.
Local officials urged residents to seek shelter.
In Solomyanskyi district, a fire broke out on the 11th floor of a 16-story residential building. Emergency services evacuated three people from the apartment and rescue operations were ongoing. Another fire broke out in a metal warehouse.
In northern Chernihiv region, a Shahed drone exploded near an apartment building, shattering windows and doors, according to regional military administration chief Dmytro Bryzhynskyi.
He added that explosions from ballistic missiles were also recorded on the outskirts of the city.
Ukrainian air defences trying to repel drone waves, says Kyiv
Russian drones approached Kyiv in waves and air defence units were attempting to repel them, the head of the city’s military administration said.
Tymur Tkachenko later warned of a risk of ballistic missiles being deployed against the capital, Reuters reports.
He said Russia’s drone attack on Kyiv early on Friday triggered fires in residential buildings in different parts of the city
Tkachenko said drones had struck the upper floors of a high-rise apartment building and started a fire in Darnytskyi district on the east side of the city, where he said emergency power cuts were possible.
One unofficial Telegram channel said a shopping centre in the area was ablaze.
Tkachenko said a fire had also broken out in an apartment building in a western district. Drone fragments had been spotted in three districts, he said.
Welcome to today’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine, where the capital is under attack from Russian drones early and authorities say drone fragments have fallen in different parts of the city.
Witnesses reported a series of explosions in Kyiv, with one of them reporting a large fire at a site where one drone had fallen.
“Enemy drones are approaching one after the other on approaches to the capital from different directions and in the city’s airspace,” Tymur Tkachenko, head of the city’s military administration, wrote on Telegram.
The attacks came after Russia accused Kyiv of state terrorism over its daring drone operation striking Russian heavy bomber planes at air bases in Siberia and the far north at the weekend and said it it would respond as and when its military saw fit.
Donald Trump said that during a call with Vladimir Putin on Wednesday he urged the Russian president to refrain from retaliating, but fully expected Moscow to strike back.
“It’s probably not going to be pretty. I don’t like it,” said Trump, who described what he called “great hatred” between Putin and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
Tkachenko said on Friday that in Kyiv drone fragments had been spotted in three districts on opposite sides of the Dnipro River that bisects the city. One drone had fallen on a building, he said, and details on damage and possible casualties were being collated.
In other key developments:
The IAEA’s team at Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine heard repeated rounds of gunfire that appeared to be aimed at drones reportedly attacking the site’s training centre, the head of the UN’s nuclear safety watchdog said on Thursday. There were no immediate reports of damage to the centre, it said.
Russia launched a series of missiles and drones across Ukraine hours after Trump and Putin spoke on Wednesday. At least five people – including a one-year-old boy, his mother and grandmother – were killed when a drone struck a residential building in the northern Ukrainian city of Pryluky.
German chancellor Friedrich Merz urged Trump to increase pressure on Russia to end the war.

President Donald Trump’s pick to be U.S. surgeon general has said the nation’s medical and food systems are corrupted by special interests and people out to make a profit at the expense of Americans’ health
PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- President Donald Trump’s pick to be the next U.S. surgeon general has repeatedly said the nation’s medical, health and food systems are corrupted by special interests and people out to make a profit at the expense of Americans’ health.
Yet as Dr. Casey Means has criticized scientists, medical schools and regulators for taking money from the food and pharmaceutical industries, she has promoted dozens of health and wellness products — including specialty basil seed supplements, a blood testing service and a prepared meal delivery service — in ways that put money in her own pocket.
A review by The Associated Press found Means, who has carved out a niche in the wellness industry, set up deals with an array of businesses.
In her newsletter, on her social media accounts, on her website, in her book and during podcast appearances, the entrepreneur and influencer has at times failed to disclose that she could profit or benefit in other ways from sales of products she recommends. In some cases, she promoted companies in which she was an investor or adviser without consistently disclosing the connection, the AP found.
Means, 37, has said she recommends products that she has personally vetted and uses herself. She is far from the only online creator who doesn’t always follow federal transparency rules that require influencers to disclose when they have a “material connection” to a product they promote.
Still, legal and ethics experts said those business entanglements raise concerns about conflicting interests for an aspiring surgeon general, a role responsible for giving Americans the best scientific information on how to improve their health.
“I fear that she will be cultivating her next employers and her next sponsors or business partners while in office,” said Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project, a progressive ethics watchdog monitoring executive branch appointees.
The nomination, which comes amid a whirlwind of Trump administration actions to dismantle the government’s public integrity guardrails, also has raised questions about whether Levels, a company Means co-founded that sells subscriptions for devices that continuously monitor users’ glucose levels, could benefit from this administration’s health guidance and policy.
Though scientists debate whether continuous glucose monitors are beneficial for people without diabetes, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has promoted their use as a precursor to making certain weight-loss drugs available to patients.
The aspiring presidential appointee has built her own brand in part by criticizing doctors, scientists and government officials for being “bought off” or “corrupt” because of ties to industry.
Means' use of affiliate marketing and other methods of making money from her recommendations for supplements, medical tests and other health and dietary products raise questions about the extent to which she is influenced by a different set of special interests: those of the wellness industry.
Means earned her medical degree from Stanford University, but she dropped out of her residency program in Oregon in 2018, and her license to practice is inactive. She has grown her public profile in part with a compelling origin story that seeks to explain why she left her residency and conventional medicine.
“During my training as a surgeon, I saw how broken and exploitative the healthcare system is and left to focus on how to keep people out of the operating room,” she wrote on her website.
Means turned to alternative approaches to address what she has described as widespread metabolic dysfunction driven largely by poor nutrition and an overabundance of ultra-processed foods. She co-founded Levels, a nutrition, sleep and exercise-tracking app that can also give users insights from blood tests and continuous glucose monitors. The company charges $199 per year for an app subscription and an additional $184 per month for glucose monitors.
Means has argued that the medical system is incentivized not to look at the root causes of illness but instead to maintain profits by keeping patients sick and coming back for more prescription drugs and procedures.
“At the highest level of our medical institutions, there are conflicts of interest and corruption that are actually making the science that we’re getting not as accurate and not as clean as we’d want it,” she said on Megyn Kelly's podcast last year.
But even as Means decries the influence of money on science and medicine, she has made her own deals with business interests.
During the same Megyn Kelly podcast, Means mentioned a frozen prepared food brand, Daily Harvest. She promoted that brand in a book she published last year. What she didn’t mention in either instance: Means had a business relationship with Daily Harvest.
Influencer marketing has expanded beyond the beauty, fashion and travel sectors to “encompass more and more of our lives,” said Emily Hund, author of “The Influencer Industry: The Quest for Authenticity on Social Media.”
With more than 825,000 followers on Instagram and a newsletter that she has said reached 200,000 subscribers, Means has a direct line into the social media feeds and inboxes of an audience interested in health, nutrition and wellness.
Affiliate marketing, brand partnerships and similar business arrangements are growing more popular as social media becomes increasingly lucrative for influencers, especially among younger generations. Companies might provide a payment, free or discounted products or other benefits to the influencer in exchange for a post or a mention. But most consumers still don’t realize that a personality recommending a product might make money if people click through and buy, said University of Minnesota professor Christopher Terry.
“A lot of people watch those influencers, and they take what those influencers say as gospel,” said Terry, who teaches media advertising and internet law. Even his own students don’t understand that influencers might stand to benefit from sales of the products they endorse, he added.
Many companies, including Amazon, have affiliate marketing programs in which people with substantial social media followings can sign up to receive a percentage of sales or some other benefit when someone clicks through and buys a product using a special individualized link or code shared by the influencer.
Means has used such links to promote various products sold on Amazon. Among them are books, including the one she co-wrote, “Good Energy""; a walking pad; soap; body oil; hair products; cardamom-flavored dental floss; organic jojoba oil; a razor set; reusable kitchen products; sunglasses; a sleep mask; a silk pillowcase; fitness and sleep trackers; protein powder and supplements.
She also has shared links to products sold by other companies that included “affiliate” or “partner” coding, indicating she has a business relationship with the companies. The products include an AI-powered sleep system and Daily Harvest, for which she curated a “metabolic health collection.”
On a “My Faves” page that was taken down from her website shortly after Trump picked her, Means wrote that some links “are affiliate links and I make a small percentage if you buy something after clicking them.”
It's not clear how much money Means has earned from her affiliate marketing, partnerships and other agreements. Daily Harvest did not return messages seeking comment, and Means said she could not comment on the record during the confirmation process.
Means has raised concerns that scientists, regulators and doctors are swayed by the influence of industry, oftentimes pointing to public disclosures of their connections. In January, she told the Kristin Cavallari podcast “Let’s Be Honest” that “relationships are influential.”
“There’s huge money, huge money going to fund scientists from industry,"" Means said. ""We know that when industry funds papers, it does skew outcomes.”
In November, on a podcast run by a beauty products brand, Primally Pure, she said it was “insanity” to have people connected to the processed food industry involved in writing food guidelines, adding, “We need unbiased people writing our guidelines that aren’t getting their mortgage paid by a food company.”
On the same podcast, she acknowledged supplement companies sponsor her newsletter, adding, “I do understand how it’s messy.”
Influencers who endorse or promote products in exchange for payment or something else of value are required by the Federal Trade Commission to make a clear and conspicuous disclosure of any business, family or personal relationship. While Means did provide disclosures about newsletter sponsors, the AP found in other cases Means did not always tell her audience when she had a connection to the companies she promoted. For example, a “Clean Personal & Home Care Product Recommendations” guide she links to from her website contains two dozen affiliate or partner links and no disclosure that she could profit from any sales.
Means has said she invested in Function Health, which provides subscription-based lab testing for $500 annually. Of the more than a dozen online posts the AP found in which Means mentioned Function Health, more than half did not disclose she had any affiliation with the company.
Means also listed the supplement company Zen Basil as a company for which she was an “Investor and/or Advisor.” The AP found posts on Instagram, X and on Facebook where Means promoted its products without disclosing the relationship.
Though the “About” page on her website discloses an affiliation with both companies, that’s not enough, experts said. She is required to disclose any material connection she has to a company anytime she promotes it.
Representatives for Function Health did not return messages seeking comment through their website and executives' LinkedIn profiles. Zen Basil's founder, Shakira Niazi, did not answer questions about Means' business relationship with the company or her disclosures of it. She said the two had known each other for about four years and called Means' advice “transformational,” saying her teachings reversed Niazi's prediabetes and other ailments.
“I am proud to sponsor her newsletter through my company,” Niazi said in an email.
While the disclosure requirements are rarely enforced by the FTC, Means should have been informing her readers of any connections regardless of whether she was violating any laws, said Olivier Sylvain, a Fordham Law School professor who was previously a senior adviser to the FTC chair.
“What you want in a surgeon general, presumably, is someone who you trust to talk about tobacco, about social media, about caffeinated alcoholic beverages, things that present problems in public health,” Sylvain said, adding, “Should there be any doubt about claims you make about products?”
Means isn’t the first surgeon general nominee whose financial entanglements have raised eyebrows.
Jerome Adams, who served as surgeon general from 2017 to 2021, filed federal disclosure forms that showed he invested in several health technology, insurance and pharmaceutical companies before taking the job — among them Pfizer, Mylan and UnitedHealth Group. He also invested in the food and drink giant Nestle.
He divested those stocks when he was confirmed for the role and pledged that he and his immediate family would not acquire financial interest in certain industries regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.
Vivek Murthy, who served as surgeon general twice, under Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, made more than $2 million in COVID-19-related speaking and consulting fees from Carnival, Netflix, Estee Lauder and Airbnb between holding those positions. He pledged to recuse himself from matters involving those parties for a period of time.
Means has not yet gone through a Senate confirmation hearing and has not yet announced the ethical commitments she will make for the role.
Hund said that as influencer marketing becomes more common, it is raising more ethical questions, such as what past influencers who enter government should do to avoid the appearance of a conflict.
Other administration officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz, have also promoted companies on social media without disclosing their financial ties.
“This is like a learning moment in the evolution of our democracy,” Hund said. “Is this a runaway train that we just have to get on and ride, or is this something that we want to go differently?”

Mary Miller, an Illinois representative, on Friday published – then deleted – a post on X saying that Giani Singh, a Sikh Granthi from southern New Jersey, should not have delivered the House’s morning prayer.
Miller at first mistakenly identified Singh as a Muslim and said that it was “deeply troubling” someone of that faith had been allowed to lead prayer in the House and it “should never have been allowed”, Miller posted on X.
“America was founded as a Christian nation, and I believe our government should reflect that truth, not drift further from it,” Miller continued. “May God have mercy.”
Miller first edited her post to change Muslim to Sikh – then opted to delete it.
Her comments triggered swift outrage, with the Democratic House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, saying: “It’s deeply troubling that such an ignorant and hateful extremist is serving in the United States Congress. That would be you, Mary.”
Similarly, David Valadao, a Republican congressman of California, said on Friday: “I’m troubled by my colleague’s remarks about this morning’s Sikh prayer, which have since been deleted. Throughout the country – and in the Central Valley – Sikh-Americans are valued and respected members of our communities, yet they continue to face harassment and discrimination.”
Jared Huffman, another Democratic US House member from California, wrote on X: “I often say that I serve in Congress with some of the greatest minds of the 18th century. With [representative] Miller I may need to take it back a few more centuries.”
Meanwhile, the Democratic congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman of New Jersey said on X: “It’s deeply troubling that someone with such contempt for religious freedom is allowed to serve in this body. This should have never been allowed to happen. America was founded as free nation, and I believe the conduct of its legislators should reflect that truth, not drift further from it.”
Grace Meng, a Democratic congresswoman from New York, also weighed in on Miller’s tweets, saying: “What’s deeply disturbing is the blatant ignorance and anti-Sikh, anti-Muslim xenophobia coming from my colleague across the aisle. There is no place in our country, and especially the halls of Congress, for this hate and intolerance.”
Meng went on to add: “The tweet may have been deleted, but we still have the receipts.”
The Congressional Asian Pacific American caucus (Capac) also condemned Miller, saying she had engaged in “anti-Sikh and anti-Muslim bigotry”.
“Sikhs and Muslims practice two separate and distinct religions, and conflating the two based on how someone looks is not only ignorant, but also racist,” Capac said in a statement.
The Sikh Coalition also responded on X, saying: “To be clear, deleting the tweet is not enough. Congresswoman Miller should apologize for her remarks – to both the Sikh and Muslim communities, because no one should be targeted on the basis of their identity.”
Similarly, the Hindu American Foundation said: “Whichever version of the tweet [Miller] was going with, it is racist, xenophobic and plainly un-American to lash out over a Sikh prayer. When you took your oath of office [congresswoman] Miller, you swore to uphold our constitution, whose first amendment prohibits your establishing an official religion or favoring one religion over another.”

Power bills in California have jumped nearly 50% in four years. Democrats think they have solutions,https://www.yahoo.com/news/power-bills-california-jumped-nearly-185727709.html,2025-06-06T18:57:27Z,,"Power bills in California have jumped nearly 50% in four years. Democrats think they have solutions
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California lawmakers this week advanced several efforts aimed at reining in utility profits and slashing electricity bills as part of their agenda to tackle the sky-high costs of living.
The proposals would make sweeping changes to how utilities fund expensive infrastructure projects like putting power lines underground to guard against wildfires. They also would add more oversight around wildfire mitigation spending and put new requirements on utility requests to increase rates. Supporters said the goal is to make the big investor-owned utilities start sharing some of the costs to fight wildfires and build new transmission infrastructure.
“This is not a set of modest tweaks that will make minor improvements at the edges of a problem without offending anyone,” said Democratic State Sen. Josh Becker, the bill’s author. “This is a big deal.”
One of the bills is part of the state Senate's package to address affordability amid growing concern about the high costs of everything from gas to groceries. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed an executive order last year urging lawmakers to do something to address skyrocketing electricity rates, which rose 47% on average for residential customers between 2019 and 2023, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Analysts Office.
But Republicans, who are in the minority in both chambers, say Democrats are not meaningfully addressing high prices. They did not support the energy reform bills, saying it wouldn't lower costs, and they unsuccessfully tried to force a vote on a proposal to limit utilities from raising power rates above the rate of inflation.
Rising rates
Utility rate increases in recent years have been approved by state regulators in part to help investor-owned utilities bury power lines aimed at stopping wildfires. Some of the deadliest and most destructive fires in recent years have been sparked by power equipment. Pacific Gas & Electric, whose equipment sparked a 2018 wildfire that killed 85 people in 2024, raised its rates six times to help cover the costs of putting power lines underground and other improvement projects.
While one in every five ratepayers can't pay their power bills, utilities like PG&E raked in record-breaking profits last year, according to The Utility Reform Network, a ratepayer advocacy group. The group supports Becker's measure and has sponsored a similar effort in the Assembly.
“There are no limits to how much the utilities can ask for in rate increases. There are no limits to how many times a year they can ask,” said Mark Toney, the group's executive director. “You can’t blame them for asking for the sky.”
Under Becker's proposal, utilities would be required to use public financing to fund the first $15 billion spent on capital investment projects. The option would allow utilities to access funding with lower interest rates, and utilities also would be prohibited from collecting a return on that investment for shareholders. That would save customers $8.8 billion over the next 10 years, Becker said.
The bill would also set up a state-backed fund to reimburse utilities for wildfire projects, among other things. But the state may not have money to pay for that this year.
The bill would also increase oversight of utility budgets and their wildfire spending. Utilities would have to include at least one rate increase proposal that doesn't exceed the rate of inflation in their requests. The proposal also calls for $60 billion worth of credits to apply on bills over the years during the summer months when usage is often at its peak.

Opposition from Republicans, utilities
Senate Democrats overwhelmingly advanced Becker's measure this week. But Republicans, utilities and the California Chamber of Commerce said it would only drive up more costs. The legislation “moves today's utility costs around without eliminating them,” the chamber said in a letter in opposition. New regulations around rate increase and shareholder returns also could halt utilities' investment in preventing wildfires or enhancing the grid, the letter said.
Republican State senators said rising power bills are caused by Democrats' policies and push for more electric vehicles and less reliance on fossil fuels. In the Assembly, meanwhile, Republicans have called for permitting reforms to make it faster and cheaper to build better utility infrastructure.
“The regulation regime that we have in this state is oppressive and definitely drives prices,” said Sen. Roger Niello, a Republican. “Your package of affordability is rather modest in number, but it is even more modest in its potential impact.”
Lawmakers also advanced a slew of other measures aiming to provide relief to ratepayers, including one that would prohibit utilities from using rates to pay for lobbying efforts and one that would allow California to join a regional energy market with other Western states to help increase grid reliability.",Yahoo News,"['executive order', 'oversight', 'executive order']","['California', 'SACRAMENTO', 'Calif.', 'AP', 'California', 'Josh Becker', 'Senate', 'Gavin Newsom', 'Legislative Analysts Office', 'Pacific Gas & Electric', 'PG&E', 'The Utility Reform Network', 'Becker', 'Assembly', 'Mark Toney', 'Becker', '$15 billion', '$8.8 billion', 'Becker', 'Utilities', '$60 billion', 'Senate', 'Becker', 'the California Chamber of Commerce', 'State', 'Assembly', 'Roger Niello', 'California']",Energy Infrastructure
St. George one step closer to its own school district.

Other Baton Rouge lawmakers, however, still oppose the proposed new school district, objecting to ongoing cross-district enrollment between St. George and the East Baton Rouge Parish school system, as well as the racial impact of the way the lines for the new city were drawn.
The House voted 61-24 in favor of Senate Bill 234, the St. George school enabling legislation; it needed a simple majority to pass. Twenty state representatives were absent. That bill now returns to the state Senate for concurrence in House amendments.
A second St. George school bill, Senate Bill 25, a proposed constitutional amendment, awaits action on the House floor. It requires a two-thirds majority to pass. That’s 70 votes if all members of the House are present. If it clears the House, it too will have to return to the Senate for a final vote.
The legislative session ends June 12.
If both bills pass the Legislature, the final decision on whether St. George gets its own school district would rest with the voters of Louisiana. A statewide referendum is planned for April 18, 2026 — there’s a chance it gets pushed back to November 2026. The proposed constitutional amendment needs to pass statewide as well as in the entirety of East Baton Rouge Parish.
If successful, the new school district would begin operating in July 2027. It would be the fifth public school district in East Baton Rouge Parish, following the lead of Baker, Central and Zachary, which broke away in 2003 and 2007.
Rep. Barbara Freiberg, R-Baton Rouge and former parish school board president, came out in favor of SB 234 after she said she worked for “hundreds of hours” on amendments with lead author Sen. Rick Edmonds, R-St. George, and co-author, Rep. Emily Chenevert, R-Baton Rouge.
Freiberg sought to have St. George absorb a greater share of an estimated $60 million in legacy costs, most of it connected with medical care of retirees. Now, the two sides have to start meeting within 60 days of the law taking effect to hash out a settlement of all assets and liabilities, including retiree health care costs.
Also the revised bill sunsets proposed cross-district enrollment, including in magnet schools; that enrollment ends when children finish at their current schools. The original version would have allowed cross-district magnet enrollment in perpetuity.
“I know we worked very, very hard and I think we have covered all the variables,” Freiberg said.
Freibergs said she has also worked closely with parish school leaders to improve the legislation. The parish School Board on May 19 approved a resolution opposing the two St. George bills “as written.”
Rep. Edmond Jordan, D-Baton Rouge, however, objected to the still lengthy cross-district enrollment — “That could take 13 years.” He noted that’s not how Baker, Central and Zachary schools were organized.
“Why would that be on the table when I thought the whole purpose of setting up the St. George school system was because the East Baton Rouge school system was running so poorly?” Jordan asked.
“It’s like they want their cake and to eat it too.""
Jordan also objected to the St. George city map, which is much different than the St. George boundaries first proposed in 2013.
“They drew the lines in a way that diluted black voter participation,” Jordan said.

The US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has said it will open two supply distribution centres intended to provide aid on Thursday, Reuters is reporting.
The group closed its facilities after the Israeli army warned that roads leading to distribution centres were “considered combat zones” and was due to reopen them this morning, but pushed the time back for what it said were maintenance and repair work. It did not say when distribution of supplies would resume later today.
The group has been fiercely criticised by humanitarian organisations, including the United Nations.
The UN has warned that most of Gaza’s 2.3 million population is at risk of famine after an 11-week Israeli blockade of the enclave.
Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday the bodies of two Israeli-Americans killed in Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack and held in Gaza had been returned to Israel. Netanyahu said the remains of Judih Weinstein Haggai and Gad Haggai were recovered and returned to Israel in a special operation by the army and the Shin Bet internal security agency.
Israeli president Isaac Herzog described the return of the bodies of Judih Weinstein Haggai and Gad Haggai as “a moment of deep pain, but also one of solace and the resolution of uncertainty”. “We will continue to do everything in our power to bring our sisters and brothers back from hell,” he said in a post on X.
Iran on Thursday “strongly” condemned the United States for vetoing a United Nations security council resolution that called for an immediate ceasefire and full humanitarian access in Gaza. Foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baqaei said in a statement that the US move to block the resolution, which was supported by 14 of the 15 members of the council, demonstrated “the country’s complicity in the crimes of the Zionist regime (Israel) and strongly condemned it”.
German foreign minister Johann Wadephul criticised Israel’s actions in the Gaza Strip at a press conference with his Israeli counterpart Gideon Saar in Berlin on Thursday, again calling for more humanitarian aid to be allowed into the territory. Wadephul decried the Israeli government’s announcement that it would allow 22 more settlements in the West Bank. Wadephul also said that recognising a Palestinian state now would send “the wrong signal” because “negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians must be concluded” first.
Aid needs to reach the people of Gaza “at speed and at volume”, UK prime minister Keir Starmer said as he restated his view the current situation was “utterly intolerable”. He told reporters on Thursday: “Of course, humanitarian aid needs to get in at speed and at volume, but that can only happen if we get back to a ceasefire”.
More than 2,700 children under the age of five in Gaza were diagnosed with acute malnutrition in the second half of May, “reflecting a sharp deterioration”, reports the Office of the UN high commissioner for human rights (OHCHR). This latest figure is almost triple the proportion of children diagnosed with malnutrition out of those screened in February 2025 during the ceasefire, OHCHR reported.
Three journalists have been killed and a fourth critically injured a fourth in an Israeli attack on Al-Ahli hospital, also known as the Baptist hospital, in Gaza City, Al Jazeera reported.
Israel claimed it was targeting an Islamic Jihad militant operating in the courtyard of the Al-Ahli hospital. Gaza’s health ministry has not yet identified the journalists or said which outlets they worked for.
Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli strikes killed at least 10 people in Gaza on Thursday as the military keeps up an intensified offensive. “Ten martyrs so far resulting from Israeli strikes since dawn,” agency spokesperson Mahmud Bassal told Agence France-Presse (AFP), adding that they had targeted an area where displaced civilians were sheltering in the southern city of Khan Younis and houses in Gaza City and the central town of Deir el-Balah. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to an AFP request for comment.
Brazil’s president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva on Thursday during a trip to Paris accused Israel of carrying out “premeditated genocide” in Gaza. “It’s a premeditated genocide from a far-right government that is waging a war against the interests of its own people,” he said at a joint press conference with France’s president Emmanuel Macron. While Lula has previously used the term “genocide”, Macron has refused to.
Donald Trump has signed a sweeping order banning travel from 12 countries and restricting travel from seven others, reviving and expanding the travel bans from his first term. Iran, Afghanistan and Yemen are among the 12 countries from which Trump has banned nationals travelling into the US from.
UN relief agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, on Thursday highlighted the lack of hygiene supplies for women and girls menstruating in the Gaza Strip. In a post on X on Thursday, the UN agency wrote: “There are around 700,000 women and girls of menstruating age from the Gaza Strip. Since the State of Israel imposed a siege on Gaza on 2 March, there has been a complete depletion of hygiene supplies, including sanitary pads.”
Ms Rachel, the children’s entertainer and educator whose YouTube videos have been watched by millions of families around the world, said she is willing to risk her career to keep advocating for suffering children in Gaza. In an interview with WBUR, a Boston-based public radio station, Ms Rachel, whose full name is Rachel Griffin Accurso, said she had received pushback for speaking out to raise awareness of the situation in Gaza, where more than 54,000 people have been killed in Israel’s ongoing military assault. But Accurso said she would continue to advocate for children’s safety.
Russian president Vladimir Putin is ready to “help resolve” the standoff between Iran and the United States over Tehran’s nuclear programme, the Kremlin said on Thursday. “We have a close partnership with Tehran. And President Putin said that he was ready to use this partnership to help resolve the Iranian nuclear issue,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
Visiting EU commissioner for the Mediterranean Dubravka Šuica said on Thursday that a €175m package for Syria was a “clear message” of support for its reconstruction. Šuica announced the package in Damascus on Wednesday, saying it would focus on sectors including energy, education, health and agriculture, helping rebuild Syria’s economy, support its institutions and promote human rights.
Iran 'strongly' condemns US veto of UN Gaza ceasefire resolution
Iran on Thursday “strongly” condemned the United States for vetoing a United Nations security council resolution that called for an immediate ceasefire and full humanitarian access in Gaza.
Foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baqaei said in a statement that the US move to block the resolution, which was supported by 14 of the 15 members of the council, demonstrated “the country’s complicity in the crimes of the Zionist regime (Israel) and strongly condemned it”.
Iran has ‘strongly’ condemned the US veto of a United Nations security council resolution calling for an “immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire” in Gaza, according to a breaking news line from Agence France-Presse (AFP).
The playwright Caryl Churchill has pulled out of a project at London’s Donmar Warehouse, citing the organisation’s sponsorship by Barclays and the bank’s links to Israel.
In a statement, Churchill, a longtime supporter of Palestinian rights, said that the London theatre should drop its association with the bank, which has been criticised for providing financial services to defence companies supplying Israel.
She said:
Theatres used to say they couldn’t manage without tobacco sponsorship, but they do. Now it’s time they stopped helping advertise banks that support what Israel is doing to Palestinians.
More than 300 arts workers and creatives, including the actors Alfred Enoch, Samuel West, Tim Crouch, Harriet Walter and Juliet Stevenson have signed an open letter supporting Churchill’s decision.
The project Churchill was working on had not been announced but would have been the first time she had worked with the Donmar since 2020’s Far Away.
Barclays sponsorship has led to controversy at a UK arts organisation before.
There has been no immediate response from Iran on Donald Trump’s travel ban. Iran is one of 12 countries that will be “fully” restricted from entering the US.
My colleagues, Rebecca Ratcliffe and Helen Livingstone, have this reaction from Jamal Abdi, the president of the National Iranian American Council:
The impact of the ban will once again be felt by Americans who were denied the ability to see their loved ones at weddings, funerals, or the birth of a child.
The move bans all travel to the US by nationals of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.
German foreign minister tells Israeli counterpart to allow more aid into Gaza
German foreign minister Johann Wadephul criticised Israel’s actions in the Gaza Strip at a press conference with his Israeli counterpart Gideon Saar in Berlin on Thursday, again calling for more humanitarian aid to be allowed into the territory.
According to Reuters, Wadephul also decried the Israeli government’s announcement that it would allow 22 more settlements in the West Bank.
Germany would continue to deliver weapons to Israel, he added, saying the country needed to defend itself.
Wadephul also said on Thursday that recognising a Palestinian state now would send “the wrong signal”, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). He said that “negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians must be concluded” before the recognition of a Palestinian state.
More than 2,700 under-fives in Gaza were diagnosed with acute malnutrition in second half of May, says OHCHR
More than 2,700 children under the age of five in Gaza were diagnosed with acute malnutrition in the second half of May, “reflecting a sharp deterioration”, reports the Office of the UN high commissioner for human rights (OHCHR).
In its latest Gaza humanitarian situation update, the UN agency, said that of 46,738 children under the age of five who were screened for malnutrition in the second half of May, 5.8% were diagnosed with acute malnutrition, up from 4.7% in the first half of May. This latest figure is almost triple the proportion of children diagnosed with malnutrition out of those screened in February 2025 during the ceasefire, OHCHR reported.
The humanitarian agency also warned that there are now only four stabilisation centres for the treatment of severe acute malnutrition cases with medical complications in the Gaza Strip, including two in Deir al-Balah, one in Khan Younis, and one in Gaza City.
“Stabilisation centres in north Gaza and Rafah have been forced to suspend operations, leaving children in these areas without access to lifesaving treatment,” it added.
Brazil’s president accuses Israel of 'premeditated genocide' in Gaza
Brazil’s president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva on Thursday during a trip to Paris accused Israel of carrying out “premeditated genocide” in the Palestinian territory of Gaza.
“It’s a premeditated genocide from a far-right government that is waging a war against the interests of its own people,” he said at a joint press conference with France’s president Emmanuel Macron, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).
While Lula has previously used the term “genocide”, Macron has refused to, saying last month it was not for a “political leader to use to term but up to historians to do so when the time comes”.
Aid needs to reach Gaza 'at speed and at volume' says UK prime minister
Aid needs to reach the people of Gaza “at speed and at volume”, Keir Starmer said as he restated his view the current situation was “utterly intolerable”, reports the PA news agency.
He told reporters:
In relation to what’s happening in Gaza, we’ve been absolutely clear that it is intolerable and we need to get back to a ceasefire urgently and that is our constant work with other allies to get us to that position.
We need those hostages to come out, many of them have been held for a very long time.
And of course, humanitarian aid needs to get in at speed and at volume, but that can only happen if we get back to a ceasefire so I’m absolutely clear that the situation as it is is utterly intolerable, and that’s why we’ve taken measures like the trading talks have been stood down, the sanctions we’ve put in and we’re working with allies to see what else we can do.
Israel has claimed it was targeting an Islamic Jihad militant operating in the courtyard of the Al-Ahli Hospital in an attack in which three local reporters were killed and six people were wounded (see earlier post). Gaza’s Health Ministry has not yet identified the journalists or said which outlets they worked for.
Over 180 journalists and media workers have been killed since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, the vast majority of them in Gaza, according to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists. Israel has said many of those killed in its strikes were militants posing as reporters.
US-backed logistics group to reopen two distribution centres intended to supply aid
The US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has said it will open two supply distribution centres intended to provide aid on Thursday, Reuters is reporting.
The group closed its facilities after the Israeli army warned that roads leading to distribution centres were “considered combat zones” and was due to reopen them this morning, but pushed the time back for what it said were maintenance and repair work. It did not say when distribution of supplies would resume later today.
The group has been fiercely criticised by humanitarian organisations, including the United Nations.
The UN has warned that most of Gaza’s 2.3 million population is at risk of famine after an 11-week Israeli blockade of the enclave.
Three journalists have been killed and a fourth critically wounded a fourth in an Israeli attack on Al-Ahli Hospital, also known as the Baptist Hospital, in Gaza City, Al Jazeera has reported.
“The attack was aimed directly at the hospital and resulted in multiple casualties,” the hospital director said. “This is the eighth attack of its kind targeting the facility since the start of the war, and this is a heavy burden on the residents since many hospitals in the Gaza Strip have been ceased their operation.”
A joint statement from the Israeli army and the Shin Bet internal security agency said the bodies of Israeli-American hostages, Judih Weinstein Haggai and Gad Haggai (see 8.33am BST), were recovered from the Khan Younis area of the southern Gaza Strip in an overnight operation.
“The rescue operation was conducted by … troops in coordination with the intelligence directorate and special forces,” it added, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).
An Israeli military official said the couple were killed on the morning of 7 October by fighters of the Mujahideen Brigades, an armed group close to Hamas ally Islamic Jihad.
Coverage of the war in Gaza is constrained by Israeli attacks on Palestinian journalists and a bar on international reporters entering the Gaza Strip to report independently on the war.
Israel has not allowed foreign reporters to enter Gaza since 7 October 2023, unless they are under Israeli military escort. Reporters who join these trips have no control over where they go, and other restrictions include a bar on speaking to Palestinians in Gaza.
Palestinian journalists and media workers inside Gaza have paid a heavy price for their work reporting on the war, with over 180 killed since the conflict began.
The committee to protect journalists has determined that at least 19 of them “were directly targeted by Israeli forces in killings which CPJ classifies as murders”.
Foreign reporters based in Israel filed a legal petition seeking access to Gaza, but it was rejected by the supreme court on security grounds. Private lobbying by diplomats and public appeals by prominent journalists and media outlets have been ignored by the Israeli government. To ensure accurate reporting from Gaza given these restrictions, the Guardian works with trusted journalists on the ground; our visual teams verify photo and videos from third parties; and we use clearly sourced data from organisations that have a track record of providing accurate information in Gaza during past conflicts, or during other conflicts or humanitarian crises.
Israeli president Isaac Herzog has described the return of the bodies of two Israeli-Americans, Judih Weinstein Haggai and Gad Haggai (see 8.33am BST), as “a moment of deep pain, but also one of solace and the resolution of uncertainty”.
“We will continue to do everything in our power to bring our sisters and brothers back from hell,” he said in a post on X.
Ms Rachel, the children’s entertainer and educator whose YouTube videos have been watched by millions of families around the world, said she is willing to risk her career to keep advocating for suffering children in Gaza.

But Accurso said she would continue to advocate for children’s safety.
“I wouldn’t be Ms Rachel if I didn’t deeply care about all kids. And I would risk everything, and I will risk my career over and over to stand up for them. It’s all about the kids for me,” Accurso told WBUR.
The UNhas described Gaza as “the hungriest place on Earth”, and warned that the Palestinian territory’s entire population is at risk of famine. Accurso said she had recently met with Palestinian women whose children were suffering in Gaza.
“When you sit with a mother who’s FaceTiming her boys in Gaza who don’t have food, and you see that anguish and you are there with her, it really moves you – I’m sorry to get emotional – to do everything you can for her,” she said.
“And of course, you say: ‘I need to do more. What can I do to help?’ I do have a big platform, and I look at it as a responsibility.”
In April, a pro-Israel group urged the US attorney generalto investigate Accurso over her messaging about children suffering in Gaza, and Accurso has been criticised by rightwing media and commentators.
Asked about the criticism, Accurso said:
It’s really painful. And I have to remind myself that people don’t know my heart, and people try to tell you who you are, but you know who you are. And I know how deeply and equally I care for all children, and I do lean on my faith in that situation.",The Guardian,['dei'],"['US', 'US', 'Gaza Humanitarian Foundation', 'Reuters', 'the United Nations', 'UN', 'Gaza', 'Benjamin Netanyahu', 'Hamas', 'Gaza', 'Israel', 'Netanyahu', 'Judih Weinstein Haggai', 'Gad Haggai', 'Israel', 'Shin Bet', 'Isaac Herzog', 'Judih Weinstein Haggai', 'X.', 'Iran', 'the United States', 'United Nations', 'Gaza', 'Esmaeil Baqaei', 'US', 'Israel', 'Johann Wadephul', 'Israel', 'the Gaza Strip', 'Gideon Saar', 'Berlin', 'Wadephul', 'the West Bank', 'Wadephul', 'Israel', 'Gaza', 'UK', 'Keir Starmer', 'Gaza', 'the Office of the', 'UN', 'OHCHR', 'OHCHR', 'Al-Ahli', 'Gaza City', 'Al Jazeera', 'Israel', 'Islamic Jihad', 'Gaza', 'Gaza', 'Gaza', 'Mahmud Bassal', 'Agence France-Presse', 'Khan Younis', 'Gaza City', 'Deir el-Balah', 'AFP', 'Brazil', 'Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva', 'Paris', 'Israel', 'Gaza', 'France', 'Emmanuel Macron', 'Lula', 'Macron', 'Donald Trump', 'Iran', 'Afghanistan', 'Yemen', 'Trump', 'US', 'UN', 'Unrwa', 'the Gaza Strip', 'UN', 'the Gaza Strip', 'the State of Israel', 'Gaza', 'Ms Rachel', 'Gaza', 'WBUR', 'Boston', 'Ms Rachel', 'Rachel Griffin Accurso', 'Gaza', 'Israel', 'Accurso', 'Vladimir Putin', 'Iran', 'the United States', 'Tehran', 'Kremlin', 'Tehran', 'Putin', 'Kremlin', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'EU', 'the Mediterranean Dubravka Šuica', '175', 'Syria', 'Šuica', 'Damascus', 'Syria', 'Iran', 'US', 'UN', 'Iran', 'the United States', 'United Nations', 'Gaza', 'Esmaeil Baqaei', 'US', 'Israel', 'Iran', 'US', 'United Nations', 'Gaza', 'Agence France-Presse', 'Caryl Churchill', 'London’s Donmar Warehouse', 'Barclays', 'Israel', 'Churchill', 'London', 'Israel', 'Theatres', 'Israel', 'Alfred Enoch', 'Samuel West', 'Tim Crouch', 'Harriet Walter', 'Juliet Stevenson', 'Churchill', 'Churchill', 'Donmar', 'UK', 'Iran', 'Donald Trump’s', 'Iran', 'US', 'Rebecca Ratcliffe', 'Helen Livingstone', 'Jamal Abdi', 'the National Iranian American Council', 'US', 'Afghanistan', 'Myanmar', 'Chad', 'Congo', 'Equatorial Guinea', 'Eritrea', 'Haiti', 'Iran', 'Libya', 'Somalia', 'Sudan', 'Yemen', 'Gaza', 'Johann Wadephul', 'Israel', 'the Gaza Strip', 'Gideon Saar', 'Berlin', 'Reuters', 'Wadephul', 'the West Bank', 'Germany', 'Israel', 'Wadephul', 'Agence France-Presse', 'Israel', 'Gaza', 'Gaza', 'the Office of the', 'UN', 'OHCHR', 'Gaza', 'UN', 'OHCHR', 'the Gaza Strip', 'Deir al-Balah', 'Khan Younis', 'Gaza City', 'Gaza', 'Rafah', 'Brazil', 'Israel', 'Gaza', 'Brazil', 'Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva', 'Paris', 'Israel', 'Gaza', 'France', 'Emmanuel Macron', 'Agence France-Presse', 'Lula', 'Macron', 'Gaza', 'UK', 'Gaza', 'Keir Starmer', 'Gaza', 'Israel', 'Islamic Jihad', 'the Al-Ahli Hospital', 'Gaza', 'Health Ministry', 'Gaza', 'New York', 'Committee to Protect Journalists', 'Israel', 'US', 'US', 'Gaza Humanitarian Foundation', 'Reuters', 'the United Nations', 'UN', 'Gaza', 'Al-Ahli Hospital', 'the Baptist Hospital', 'Gaza City', 'Al Jazeera', 'the Gaza Strip', 'Shin Bet', 'Judih Weinstein Haggai', 'Gad Haggai', 'BST', 'Khan Younis', 'Gaza Strip', 'Agence France-Presse', 'the Mujahideen Brigades', 'Hamas', 'Islamic Jihad', 'Gaza', 'the Gaza Strip', 'Israel', 'Gaza', 'Gaza', 'Gaza', 'CPJ', 'Israel', 'Gaza', 'the supreme court', 'Gaza', 'Guardian', 'Gaza', 'Isaac Herzog', 'Judih Weinstein Haggai', 'Gad Haggai', 'BST', 'Gaza', 'WBUR', 'Boston', 'Ms Rachel', 'Rachel Griffin Accurso', 'Gaza', 'Israel', 'Accurso', 'Ms Rachel', 'Accurso', 'WBUR', 'Gaza', 'Accurso', 'Gaza', 'Gaza', 'US', 'Accurso', 'Gaza', 'Accurso', 'Accurso']",

WASHINGTON (AP) — Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose mistaken deportation to El Salvador became a political flashpoint in the Trump administration’s stepped-up immigration enforcement, was being returned to the United States to face criminal charges related to what the Trump administration said was a massive human smuggling operation that brought immigrants into the country illegally.

With much of Gaza in rubble, men and children were forced to hold the traditional Eid al-Adha prayers in the open air and with food supplies dwindling, families were having to make do with what they could scrape together for the three-day feast. “This is the worst feast that the Palestinian people have experienced because of the unjust war against the Palestinian people,” said Kamel Emran after attending prayers in the southern city of Khan Younis. “There is no food, no flour, no shelter, no mosques, no homes, no mattresses … The conditions are very, very harsh.” The Islamic holiday begins on the 10th day of the Islamic lunar month of Dhul-Hijja, during the Hajj season in Saudi Arabia. For the second year, Muslims in Gaza were not able to travel to Saudi Arabia to perform the traditional pilgrimage. The war broke out on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants launched a surprise attack on Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 hostages. They are still holding 56 hostages, around a third of them believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israeli forces have rescued eight living hostages from Gaza and recovered dozens of bodies. Since then, Israel has killed more than 54,000 Palestinians in its military campaign, primarily women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry which does not distinguish between civilians or combatants in its figures. The offensive has destroyed large parts of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its population of roughly 2 million Palestinians. After blocking all food and aid from entering Gaza for more than two months, Israel began allowing a trickle of supplies to enter for the U.N. several weeks ago. But the U.N says it has been unable to distribute much of the aid because of Israeli military restrictions on movements and because roads that the military designates for its trucks to use are unsafe and vulnerable to looters. The U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome said Thursday that Gaza’s people are projected to fall into acute food insecurity by September, with nearly 500,000 people experiencing extreme food deprivation, leading to malnutrition and starvation. “This means the risk of famine is really touching the whole of the Gaza Strip,” Rein Paulson, director of the FAO office of emergencies and resilience, said in an interview. Over the past two weeks, shootings have erupted nearly daily in the Gaza Strip in the vicinity of new hubs where desperate Palestinians are being directed to collect food. Witnesses say nearby Israeli troops have opened fire, and more than 80 people have been killed according to Gaza hospital officials. Israel has accused Hamas of stealing aid and trying to block it from reaching Palestinians, and has said soldiers fired warning shots or at individuals approaching its troops in some cases. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a newly formed group of mainly American contractors that Israel wants to use to replace humanitarian groups in Gaza that distribute aid in coordination with the U.N., said Friday that all its distribution centers were closed for the day due to the ongoing violence. It urged people to stay away for their own safety, and said it would make an announcement later as to when they would resume distributing humanitarian aid.

"Planned Parenthood clinics provide basic health care. If they close, where will women go?",https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/planned-parenthood-provides-basic-health-care-clinics-close-will-many-rcna210757,"Fri, 06 Jun 2025 09:30:40 GMT","Citing deep funding cuts, at least 200 Planned Parenthood clinics nationwide are at risk.","When the Trump administration suddenly froze federal funding to more than 100 Planned Parenthood clinics this spring, the organization’s Michigan branch was already deep into hard discussions about its finances.
“The leadership team and our board had been scenario planning for months to try to fill those gaps to see how we could continue providing care,” said Ashlea Phenicie, chief external affairs officer of Planned Parenthood of Michigan.
The only option was clear. Michigan’s 14 Planned Parenthood clinics serve tens of thousands of women. In order to save clinics around the state that were either busier or in places where women had few other options, the team would have to close multiple clinics, including the only one in the state’s Upper Peninsula, a large, isolated and mostly rural area surrounded by a stretch of Lake Michigan. In Ann Arbor, home of the University of Michigan, the city’s two clinics would be combined.
It’s a reality playing out across the country.
At least 20 Planned Parenthood clinics have closed or will close within the year. For decades, the health care organization has been squeezed by the same pressures choking nearly all U.S. providers –– low insurance reimbursement rates, blocked Medicaid expansion, understaffing and rising costs of providing medical care that have forced hospitals and health clinic closures throughout the country.
Uniquely, Planned Parenthood, a nonprofit that serves more than 2 million patients nationwide every year, many of them uninsured, underinsured or who qualify for Medicaid, has also become the target of pointed funding cuts that started under the first Trump administration.
“What is different this time around is that it’s much more sweeping. It’s a deeper and broader cut that will affect both more clinics and more people,” said Farzana Kapadia, a professor of epidemiology and population health at the New York University School of Global Public Health.
In March, the Trump administration withheld funding by excluding many Planned Parenthood clinics from the Title X family planning program, a federal grant program that funds family planning and reproductive health care. Then, in late May, House Republicans delivered another enormous blow, voting to end funding for Planned Parenthood as part of the reconciliation bill.
Federal law already restricts federal funds from being used for abortion, except in cases of incest, rape or if a mother’s life is in danger, through a law called the Hyde Amendment.
But if passed, the reconciliation bill would cut off Medicaid reimbursement to any nonprofit that primarily offers family planning or reproductive health services, provides abortions beyond the Hyde Amendment exceptions and received more than $1 million in Medicaid reimbursements in 2024. As a nationwide organization, Planned Parenthood does all three.
If the bill passes in the Senate, it would block Planned Parenthood clinics from billing Medicaid for any health services at all, including cancer screenings, wellness exams and birth control. It's unclear if the new legislation would apply to Planned Parenthood nationally or on a state-by-state basis.
Over half of Planned Parenthood patients are covered by publicly funded health programs like Medicaid and in 2023, about 36% of all Title X services were provided by Planned Parenthood clinics. Eliminating these sources of funding would cut hundreds of millions of dollars from Planned Parenthood’s care costs every year. Targeting federal funding for any type of care for Planned Parenthood clinics is a way opponents of abortion rights can attempt to shut down clinics that do provide abortion, even if they also offer other care.
Phenicie said Republican lawmakers appear to understand that cutting off Planned Parenthood from Title X and Medicaid reimbursement will put the clinics that perform abortion in peril, even if these funds can’t cover the procedures. The slashed funds could affect all Planned Parenthood clinics whether they offer abortion services or not.
“They know so much of our patient base is on Medicaid or needs Title X to pay for their care, they know that cutting this off will allow them to cut off access to abortion and they are willing to make that trade,” she said.
Before the cuts, Planned Parenthood was already operating on thin margins. Now, clinics are struggling to operate at a loss.
“The numbers are so devastating that there are really no options other than closing some centers and consolidating others, and then investing in our virtual health centers that can serve people across the state,” Phenicie said.
Clinics provide basic health care
At least 1 in 3 women say they have gone to a Planned Parenthood clinic for care, as well as 1 in 10 men, according to a recent KFF Health poll. Nearly half of Black women have gone to a Planned Parenthood clinic, the poll found.
Abortions, the main reason the Trump administration has ended support for the clinics, account for just 4% of the services Planned Parenthood provides, according to a 2024 annual report.
The vast majority of Planned Parenthood’s services involve basic health care for women, including diagnosing and treating urinary tract and yeast infections and screening for cervical cancer and breast cancer. Some locations offer vaccination against HPV, hepatitis B, Covid and influenza.
More than half of care is related to testing for sexually transmitted infections and treatment. Another 25% is providing access to contraception, often at low or no cost. Cancer screenings and other non-abortion services make up 18%, the report showed.
Those important medical services haven’t swayed opponents of the clinics.
In January, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., introduced a bill that sought to ban Planned Parenthood from federal funding in the same ways the federal reconciliation bill would. The bill is called the Defund Planned Parenthood Act.
“My commitment to protecting life isn’t just personal, it’s rooted in both science and principle. Life begins at conception, and I’ve spent my time in the Senate fighting to protect the right to life,” Paul said in a press release.
Closing in states that support abortion rights
About 40% of Planned Parenthood’s funding comes from government health care reimbursements and grants. Many locations offer a sliding scale payment option for people who can’t afford health care. That money comes, in part, from government programs that are now being cut.
“Cutting this funding is really about cutting access to care for people who are not insured or who are underinsured to allow for tax breaks for people who can afford their medical care,” NYU’s Kapadia said.
Wendy Stark, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Greater New York, said that even when a patient has private insurance, “the reimbursement rates are just not meeting the costs of primary care.
“The U.S. health care system pays a tiny amount of health care dollars into primary and preventative care,” Stark said. “We are sitting in a micro version of that.”
Earlier this year, Planned Parenthood announced it was selling the building that housed its only Manhattan location. Planned Parenthood locations are also shuttering throughout the Midwest and in other states that have historically voted in favor of abortion rights, including Vermont.
In late May, Planned Parenthood announced it will close four clinics in Minnesota within a year. The state was the first to codify the right to abortion into law after the Dobbs decision overturned Roe v. Wade, but only one of the closing clinics performed abortions.
Four of the six Planned Parenthood clinics in Iowa, including one in Ames, where Iowa State University is located, will also be shuttered. Four Illinois clinics, none which performed abortions, stopped operating in March. In April, three locations closed and two were consolidated in Michigan, where the right to abortion is enshrined into state law. Two Utah locations closed in May after losing a significant amount of funding as a result of the Title X freeze.
“We are subsidizing almost every visit we do, even with insurance,” Stark said. “We also have a great deal of our patients who come who do not have insurance.”
The decision to sell the Manhattan clinic was a strategic but difficult decision, she said. The revenue from the sale could help keep other clinics in the state operating. Both the patients and staff of the Manhattan clinic can be absorbed by Planned Parenthood’s other New York City locations, which can minimize the impact the closure will have.
“When we consolidate in certain locations, we look at the whole area. Can we funnel patients to our next closest health center, are there other clinics that patients can be sent to?” Stark said, adding that this is more difficult to do in rural areas that already have extremely minimal health care options.
“If we face further erosion of our finances, we will have to make more hard decisions,” she said.
Straining a fragile health care system
Several state-level laws banned Planned Parenthood from receiving Title X funds in the decade preceding the sweeping federal exclusions.
Robin Marty, the executive director of WAWC Healthcare, formerly West Alabama Women’s Center, in Tuscaloosa, said these states can provide a picture of what health care may look like in states that have more recently faced Planned Parenthood closures.
“We exist as kind of a lesson to people of what resources are like if there is not a Planned Parenthood,” she said.
Planned Parenthood operates just one brick-and-mortar clinic in Alabama, in Birmingham, but offers telehealth throughout the state. There are just two in Louisiana and one in the Florida Panhandle.
There are no physical clinics in Mississippi, which has the highest teen birth rate in the nation. Alabama and Louisiana rank in the top seven, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. Mississippi also has the highest maternal mortality rate. Louisiana comes in second. Alabama is fourth.
“There aren’t places for people to go for free birth control or STI screenings or maternal care,” she said, referring to sexually transmitted infections.
WAWC Healthcare is one of the only providers in Alabama, outside of federally qualified health centers, which are run by states or counties, that does. Already, Marty said, the clinic relies heavily on nongovernmental grants in the absence of access to Title X, though the clinic does accept Medicaid.
“Every time I apply for a grant, I know I have only about a 10% chance of getting it, but I do it anyway because that’s the only way my patients can get care,” she said. Other than grants, “we rely on donors who each donate about $50 each time we contact them.”
Marty said other clinics that provide some of the same services as Planned Parenthood, which are already operating on razor-thin margins, if not at a loss, will be further strained by closures. This strain will be passed onto patients.
“You are talking about individuals who are living at or below the poverty level who already can’t afford health care on their own and then you are eliminating a major source of their health care,” Kapadia said.
The GOP megabill, which blocks Planned Parenthood from being reimbursed with Medicaid dollars, among other Medicaid cuts, is awaiting its fate in the Senate this week. For now, Title X funding is frozen for Planned Parenthoods in 20 states.
If the “Big Beautiful Bill” passes, another 200 of the roughly 600 Planned Parenthoods will be in danger, according to Planned Parenthood.
When Title X funding was cut off to Michigan Planned Parenthood between 2019 and 2021, the number of people seeking preventative care at its locations dropped 75%, Phenicie said.
Although there are other health centers that can pay for visits using Title X funds, they could not absorb the patients Planned Parenthood could no longer see, she added.
In the month leading up to this year’s closures, Planned Parenthood Michigan kept the four closing clinics open to honor all the appointments that had already been made, and spent hours trying to help patients line up care at other clinics or through telehealth with Planned Parenthood.
“Even if they would like to continue care, if they can’t be covered under Title X and they can’t use Medicaid, their options will be limited,” Phenicie said.

House Speaker Johnson: Dems who want ICE agents unmasked 'mandated mask wearing for years' during COVID,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-speaker-johnson-dems-who-want-ice-agents-unmasked-mandated-mask-wearing-years-during-covid,"Fri, 06 Jun 2025 13:53:10 -0400",House Speaker Mike Johnson said Friday that Democrats who want ICE agents to unmask are the same &quot;people who mandated mask wearing for years in America.&quot;,"House Speaker Mike Johnson told Fox News on Friday that Democrats pushing for ICE agents to unmask themselves are the same ""people who mandated mask wearing for years in America"" during the coronavirus pandemic.
Johnson was asked by Fox News for his reaction as ""some Democrats, including [House Minority] Leader [Hakeem] Jeffries, have suggested that the ICE agents who are arresting some of these migrants should not be wearing masks.""
""From the people who mandated mask wearing for years in America. It's absurd. They need to back off of ICE and respect our agents and stop protesting against them,"" Johnson said. ""They're trying to uphold the rule of law, and they don't want to be targeted by Democrat activists. So I'm in favor of whatever protocol.""
Jeffries said Tuesday that ICE agents who attempt to conceal ""their identities from the American people, will be unsuccessful in doing that"" and they will all be identified ""no matter what it takes, no matter how long it takes.""
ICE OFFICIAL PUTS POLITICIANS ON BLAST, DEMANDING THEY ‘STOP PUTTING MY PEOPLE IN DANGER’
Johnson was then asked Friday ""so you're okay with these agents sort of not identifying themselves when they're arresting migrants?""
""Why? So that they can target them?"" he responded. ""So they can put their names and faces online and dox them? That's what these activists do. So we have to protect those who protect our communities.
""And it's absurd for anybody, members of Congress or any other elected leader, to be calling out ICE for trying to do their job. They've made it difficult for them to do it for years, and I just think it's patently absurd,"" Johnson also said.
At his weekly press conference Friday, Fox News asked Jeffries if he was concerned that possibly demasking some ICE agents puts them or their families’ safety at risk.
""It seems to me that the officials at the Department of Homeland Security, including ICE, should be held to the same standards as every other part of law enforcement in terms of transparency,"" the Democrat from New York said.
HOMELAND SECURITY SAYS BOSTON’S MAYOR COMPARING ICE AGENTS TO NEO-NAZIS IS ‘SICKENING’
On Jeffries’ official X account, in September 2020, he wrote ""It’s not that complicated. Wear. A. Mask.""
Then around a year later, in August 2021, Jeffries said ""Get vaccinated. Wear a mask. Crush the virus.""
Two Democrat senators from Virginia, Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, also wrote a letter last month to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons and other top officials about ICE’s recent immigration enforcement operations taking an ""alarming and dangerous turn.""
""Across the country and in Virginia, masked ICE officers and agents without clearly visible identification as law enforcement have been arresting individuals on the streets and in sensitive locations, such as courthouses. Such actions put everyone at risk – the targeted individuals, the ICE officers and agents, and bystanders who may misunderstand what is happening and may attempt to intervene,"" they said.
WHITE HOUSE BACKS MAJOR LEGISLATION TO SPEED UP DEPORTATIONS
""We urge you to direct ICE officers and agents to promptly and clearly identify themselves as law enforcement officers conducting law enforcement actions when arresting subjects, and limit the use of face coverings during arrests and other enforcement actions to avoid intimidation and reduce safety risks to the public,"" the Senators added.
In August 2021, Kaine pushed mask wearing as well, writing in a Facebook post that he was ""Deeply concerned about the rapid rise of COVID-19 delta variant infections we are seeing across the Commonwealth"" and that ""We should do all we can to help stop the spread of the virus and keep ourselves and our loved ones safe, including following CDC guidance such as getting vaccinated, masking up indoors, and social distancing.""
""Folks, let’s continue to protect ourselves by getting vaccinated, masking up, and social distancing so we can safely return to all of the activities we love,"" Warner added at the time.

WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court late Wednesday upheld a lower court’s order requiring the U.S. Education Department to reinstate more than 1,300 fired employees and blocking an executive order to dismantle the department and a directive to transfer some services to other federal agencies.
The ruling from a three-judge panel in the United States Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit marks a setback for President Donald Trump’s education policy agenda that includes transferring the federal student loan portfolio and special education services out of the Education Department on the way to closing the department entirely.
The panel kept in place a preliminary injunction issued by a district court in Massachusetts requiring the administration to reverse course at least while a case challenging its education policies is ongoing.
“What is at stake in this case, the District Court found, was whether a nearly half-century-old cabinet department would be permitted to carry out its statutorily assigned functions or prevented from doing so by a mass termination of employees aimed at implementing the effective closure of that department,” 1st Circuit Chief Judge David J. Barron wrote in the panel’s opinion.
“Given the extensive findings made by the District Court and the absence of any contrary evidence having been submitted by the appellants, we conclude that the appellants’ stay motion does not warrant our interfering with the ordinary course of appellate adjudication in the face of what the record indicates would be the apparent consequences of our doing so,” Barron wrote.
The Trump administration had immediately challenged an order in May from U.S. District Judge Myong J. Joun of Massachusetts.
Joun granted a preliminary injunction in a consolidated case stemming from a pair of lawsuits from a coalition of labor and advocacy groups and a slew of Democratic attorneys general.
One of the lawsuits comes from a coalition of Democratic attorneys general in Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington state and Wisconsin.
The other lawsuit was brought by the American Federation of Teachers, its Massachusetts chapter, AFSCME Council 93, the American Association of University Professors, the Service Employees International Union and two school districts in Massachusetts.
The Education Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.

Laura Barron-Lopez: This ban potentially affects thousands of people, including a young girl from Afghanistan. And we're calling her Saira, blurring her face and altering her voice to protect her identity for her safety.She spoke to producer Zeba Warsi from Peshawar in neighboring Pakistan, where she traveled from — for her U.S. visa appointment. And now she doesn't know where to go.Saira, Student from Afghanistan: As an Afghan student, we cannot study in our country. I waited for one year to complete this process. The applying for a university in the United States is not easy. Laura Barron-Lopez: Despite her best efforts, Saira feels abandoned again. Saira: Although I have successfully obtained a student visa for this fall semester, but this is a new policy is giving me anxiety. Laura Barron-Lopez: Before the Taliban took over in 2021, she was a first year journalism student at Kabul University with big dreams. But the Taliban crushed them. For the last four years, they have banned women and girls from school and from most of public life.But Saira didn't give up. She fought against the Taliban by protesting in Kabul. And, last year, she applied to 11 colleges in the U.S. and got accepted to five. This fall, she was all set to attend a college in Pennsylvania to study political science. Saira: I really want to study political science because I want to work on Afghanistan politics area, especially for women's rights in Afghanistan. My only goal is to use this opportunity in the United States, use the United States — United States education only for — to serve for my country, serve for women like me who are suffering right now, who are banned for education, who cannot have their basic rights. Laura Barron-Lopez: Saira is in neighboring Pakistan, where she traveled with her family for her U.S. student visa appointment. But with the many uncertainties around travel restrictions on Afghan nationals like her, she's worried for her future. Saira: What I will do, how I can return back to home, where the Taliban, if they know that I came to Peshawar, Pakistan, for use visa for my — continuing my education to use, they would probably tell me or do something to me. Currently, my only hope is in United States. And I hope they hear our voices and know our concern that we are relying on your country, on your education. Laura Barron-Lopez: Amna, the White House told ""News Hour"" that a student like Saira would be able to enter the United States because she was already issued her visa before the president issued this proclamation just last night.But, still, students like Saira are very anxious right now because of the president's larger crackdown on foreign national students like her.

"As We Defend Medicaid, We Can’t Lose Sight of the End Goal: Free, Universal Care",https://truthout.org/articles/as-we-defend-medicaid-we-cant-lose-sight-of-the-end-goal-free-universal-care/,"Thu, 05 Jun 2025 19:11:33 +0000","While the GOP slashes health care funding at the federal level, some state governors are following suit.","Part of the Series
Fighting for Our Lives: The Movement for Medicare for All
As congressional Republicans muscle forward a budget bill that would strip health care away from millions of Americans, Democrats have been united in their formal opposition: No cuts to Medicaid, no cuts to SNAP, and no work eligibility requirements.
“Our message is extremely simple: Care, not cuts,” said Pennsylvania State Senate Democratic Leader Jay Costa at a rally of state legislators in Harrisburg on June 2. Last month, the country’s 23 Democratic governors released a joint statement decrying the proposed cuts, writing, “As governors, we stand united against any attempt to gut these critical programs that keep our country’s kids, seniors, and veterans healthy and safe — and we invite our Republican colleagues to join us.”
Democrats are correct to fight back against Donald Trump’s austerity agenda, which would fund tax cuts for the wealthy at the expense of working families, disabled people, and seniors. But attempts to undermine taxpayer-funded health care aren’t only coming from the right. But anyone truly concerned about the latest round of GOP attacks must go beyond playing simple defense and boldly advocate for what most countries around the world already have: free and universal health care.
In the budget bill, Republicans have proposed slashing health care spending by at least $715 billion, allowing Affordable Care Act tax credits to expire, and implementing work requirements for Medicaid eligibility. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that 16 million people would lose their health insurance by 2034 if Republicans’ proposed budget becomes law, and University of Pennsylvania researchers estimate that the losses would lead to 51,000 more people dying annually.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom — widely considered a Democratic frontrunner for the 2028 presidential race — has been a prominent critic of the GOP’s Medicaid cuts. “If Republicans move this extreme MAGA proposal forward, millions will lose coverage, hospitals will close, and safety nets could collapse under the weight,” Newsom said in a statement. “We must sound the alarm because the stakes couldn’t be higher.”
But in his home state, Newsom has sung a different tune. After running for governor on a universal health care platform in 2018, Newsom expanded coverage in Medi-Cal, the state’s Medicaid program, to undocumented immigrants last year. Now, he has already proposed reversing course, unveiling a budget last month that would cut undocumented adults out of that same program in 2026. This month, Newsom presented another idea for reducing state health care costs: a $2,000 asset test for disabled and elderly Medi-Cal recipients. This means that, to qualify for coverage, an individual would have to have less than $2,000 on hand in cash, savings, or checking accounts.
Newsom raised California Medi-Cal’s asset limit to $130,000 per person in 2022 and abolished it entirely last year, leading to an uptick in enrollment by Californians aged 65 and older. Reinstating a $2,000 asset test would mean that vulnerable people would have to live with zero financial cushion — no matter how low their monthly income — in order to qualify for crucial health coverage. A single medical bill can run more than $2,000, and Medi-Cal already doesn’t cover the long-term care services that disabled and elderly people often need, including assisted living and in-home care. What’s more, the initial $2,000 threshold was set in 1989, when the cost of living was far lower than it is today: In 1990, the median rent in California was $620, compared to roughly $2,800 in 2024. In other words, one month of rent could exceed the proposed limit.
Low-income disabled Californians have expressed fears that they would no longer be able to afford in-home caretakers if they were forced to give up their savings to meet the new asset requirements. “It’s draconian — $2,000 is no safety net for people,” Kim Selfon, an attorney in Los Angeles, told CalMatters.
In a recent segment, NPR analysts speculated that Newsom is “shifting to the center” to tee up a 2028 presidential run. That framing isn’t entirely correct — Newsom has long been a corporate-friendly centrist — but it’s true that his Medi-Cal rollbacks echo the general direction of the Democratic Party. As I reported last August, the Democratic Party removed mention of a universal public health option from its 2024 platform — a shift from its messaging four years prior, which stated a goal of “achieving universal, affordable, quality health care.” While Joe Biden promised a public option on the campaign trail in 2020, he stopped advocating for it after that December. In 2021, New York Democratic leaders blocked a vote on a bill that would have created a universal single-payer health care system in the state, even though it had the support from the majority of lawmakers. A similar bill was reintroduced in the state Senate this January, but it has not moved forward.
Another state Democratic governor recently made headlines for his unfriendly stance to robust and equitable health care access. On May 29, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis vetoed a bipartisan bill, passed unanimously by the state legislature, that would’ve banned surprise ambulance billing. (When Biden banned surprise medical bills in 2022, ground ambulance services were notably exempt.)
Democrats’ tack to the right on health care is both morally wrong and politically shortsighted — polls have shown time and time again that the majority of Americans actually support universal health care. Republicans know that attacks on Medicaid are unpopular: While Trump previously promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act, he has since tried to rewrite that history. Trump and the GOP have studiously avoided “repeal-and-replace” rhetoric when discussing the current budget package, instead opting to focus on the Medicaid cuts as targeting fraud and abuse. But make no mistake: Republicans are playing their same old game of gutting public health insurance, just with new window dressing.
Abandoning a public commitment to universal health care did not help the Democrats win the 2024 election. It will not help them in 2028. All it does is leave more and more Americans unhealthy, sick, and dead — because when the center shifts right, so does everybody else.

Four years ago, Andrew Cuomo stepped down as New York’s governor amid a barrage of sexual harassment allegations and a chorus of other Democrats demanding his resignation
A growing number of Democrats who called on Andrew Cuomo to resign as governor amid sexual harassment allegations are now backing his comeback bid for New York City mayor -- including one of his opponents in the race.
On Friday, state Sen. Jessica Ramos became the latest to flip-flop on Cuomo and endorse him, casting the former governor as the candidate best suited to run the city.
“We need results, we need experience and someone who knows how to deliver under pressure,” she said at a press conference held by the Cuomo campaign in Manhattan.
Though she is backing Cuomo, Ramos said she will remain in the race to advocate for “higher wages, more housing, and a stronger voice for working people.”
The reversal from Ramos, who had called on Cuomo to resign in 2021, came just months after she described him a “corrupt bully” who “brings nothing to this race but baggage"" when he entered the race.
With her endorsement, Ramos joined lawmakers such as Rep. Adriano Espaillat, state Assembly member and Brooklyn Democratic Chair Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn and Rep. Gregory W. Meeks, along with others who have changed positions on Cuomo and now welcome his leadership ahead of the city’s Democratic primary later this month.
“There are a lot of elected officials that have decided they want to look past any bad behavior because they want to look at more immediate needs,” said Basil Smikle, a Democratic political strategist and professor at Columbia University. “They seem him as a strong person. They probably think he’s the only one that can push back against Donald Trump.”
Cuomo left office after the state attorney general released a report that determined he sexually harassed at least 11 women. He has said he did not intentionally mistreat the women but had instead fallen behind what was considered appropriate workplace conduct, while at the same criticizing the pressure for his ouster politically motivated.
For Cuomo, securing the endorsements of those who once castigated him could ease voter concerns about his past scandals and bolster his long-held thesis that he was wrongfully forced to resign.
In a statement, Cuomo said he was proud to have Ramos' support and looked forward to working with her to ""put this city back on the right track and make this a stronger and more affordable place for all working men and women.”
“We’re both proud Queens kids and with it comes a ‘Queens attitude’ that is both tough and protective of our families and our neighbors and by extension all New Yorkers,” he said.
Ramos' endorsement came a day after U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez threw her weight behind mayoral hopeful Zohran Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist who has surged in the months leading up to the primary.
Ramos has grown critical of Mamdani as the left flank of the Democratic Party has coalesced behind him.
She jabbed at the social media-savvy Mamdani during a debate this week, saying she wished she'd run for mayor sooner but “I thought I needed more experience but turns out you just need to make good videos.""",ABC News,['columbia university'],"['Cuomo', 'NYC', 'Andrew Cuomo', 'New York’s', 'Andrew Cuomo', 'New York City', 'Jessica Ramos', 'Cuomo', 'Cuomo', 'Manhattan', 'Cuomo', 'Ramos', 'Ramos', 'Cuomo', 'Ramos', 'Adriano Espaillat', 'Assembly', 'Brooklyn Democratic', 'Gregory W.

Louisiana's campaign finance laws could soon get an overhaul.

Supporters say the legislation will “modernize” Louisiana’s Campaign Finance Disclosure Act so that it more closely aligns with federal rules. They also say the changes will more strongly protect the free speech rights of people who spend money to express political views.
“Campaign finance law should be clear to prevent the wasting of constitutionally protected free speech dollars,” said Stephen Gelé, an attorney who has been involved in writing the bill. “Complaints of violation of campaign finance law should be handled judiciously and fairly, protecting the right of due process guaranteed by the United States and Louisiana Constitutions as well as protecting taxpayer dollars.”
Gelé also represents Gov. Jeff Landry in an ongoing ethics dispute.
House Bill 693, sponsored by Rep. Mark Wright, R-Covington, advanced out of the Senate and Governmental Affairs Committee on Wednesday without objection. To pass the Legislature, the measure still needs a vote by the full Senate, as well as a final stamp of approval from the House.
During a public hearing last month, the Public Affairs Research Council, a good-government watchdog group, raised concerns about the impact of the legislation on campaign finance laws.
“There’s not a single thing here that I can find that makes it more transparent to the public,” said Steven Procopio, president of PAR. “It seems like it’s all about trying to make things easier for the elected officials.”
On Wednesday, after the Senate committee made some change to the bill, Procopio said his concerns about transparency remain, but amendments related to investigations of campaign finance violations avoid legislation that is “existentially bad.”
Procopio also said he was grateful that lawmakers heeded some of the concerns raised by the Public Affairs Research Council.
Political spending and free speech
Since 1980, the stated purpose of Louisiana’s Campaign Finance Disclosure Act has been to allow for the public disclosure of political fundraising and spending, in recognition of the fact that representative government depends on a knowledgeable electorate that has confidence in its public elected officials.
But under HB 693, the law would also acknowledge that “the financing of campaigns facilitates constitutionally protected political speech.”
Adding the recognition that campaign spending is protected speech is needed so that any legal interpretations of campaign finance laws don’t violate the Louisiana and U.S. Constitutions, Gelé said.
The bill would also require that the state’s campaign finance rules be interpreted “narrowly and strictly” in the interest of respecting free speech and due process rights.
And any ambiguity in campaign finance issues should be “interpreted in favor of a person accused of violating” the laws, the bill says.
New rules for political committees
The proposed law would define four separate types of political committees, each with their own rules and disclosure requirements:
- Political committees would be set up to spend money to support or oppose candidates, propositions, political parties or recalls.
- Principal campaign committees would be set up as the sole campaign committee of a candidate.
- Independent expenditure-only committees would be set up for political advocacy work that is not coordinated with a candidate.
- Leadership committees would be set up by elected officials — separate from their campaign committees — to support their holding of public office and to contribute to other officials’ committees.
A concept called a “joint fundraising agreement” would be added to Louisiana law and authorize committees and other organizations to collaborate on political fundraising.
Contribution limits for political committees were increased under a 2024 law and would not increase further under this year’s legislation.
The limits are $12,000 for major offices, $6,000 for district offices and $2,000 for smaller local offices.
Political committees that have more than 250 members, however, can make contributions in the amounts of $24,000, $12,000 and $4,000.
There is no limit on contributions to independent expenditure-only committees.right
New rules for spending
For all candidates and committees, current law contains a broad prohibition against contributions being “used, loaned, or pledged by any person for any personal use unrelated to a political campaign, the holding of a public office or party position.”
The proposal defines new, more detailed parameters for the things candidates and committees can and cannot spend campaign money on.
All candidates and committees would be allowed to spend money on lobbying, issue advocacy, donations to tax-exempt organizations, committee operating expenses, contributions to gubernatorial transitions and independent-expenditure committees. They could also back efforts to support or oppose propositions, recalls or gubernatorial transitions.
In all cases, the measure would prohibit the use of contributions for the “personal use” of a candidate, elected official or immediate family member.
“Personal use” would be defined as spending money on something that would exist “irrespective of the candidate's campaign or the holding of office” and isn’t connected to a campaign or holding of political office.
The bill sets out a list of items that would be presumed to be for personal use:
- Household food items or supplies
- Funeral expenses, unless they are for a campaign worker
- Clothing that isn’t used for campaign, fundraising or office-holding events
- Tuition payments
- Social, recreational and private club fees that aren’t for a fundraising event or campaign or office-holding activities
On Wednesday, the Senate committee agreed to strengthen the language prohibiting campaign funds for personal use.
Sen. Greg Miller, R-Norco, a member of the committee, said it was important to guard against the use of campaign funds “for subsidizing your lifestyle.”
“I don’t think we want to encourage that,” he said.
The bill also sets out a list of items that would not be considered personal use:
- Candidate and immediate family member attendance at political events including Washington Mardi Gras and conferences for political parties, professional groups or social advocacy groups.
- Security measures for a candidate, elected official, family members or campaign workers, including security systems and personnel
- Taxes on interest earned by campaign funds
- Campaign loan interest
- Costs to replace damaged, lost or stolen campaign items
For each of the four committee types, the legislation spells out additional spending rules.
New reporting requirements
Under the legislation, monetary thresholds that trigger a variety of campaign finance reporting requirements would increase.
For example, political committees would have to report contributions and expenditures when they reach $1,000, up from $500.
Similarly, committees that anticipate receiving or spending $1,000 a year would need to file a statement of organization, up from $500.
Reporting requirements for some out-of-state entities contributing to Louisiana elections would be triggered at $50,000 of spending, up from $20,000.
Anyone who isn’t a candidate or a committee would need to file disclosure reports for political spending for anything over $1,000, up from $500 currently. But unlike current law, disclosures would only be needed in specific cases of “express advocacy.”
Changes to Board of Ethics investigations
The Louisiana Board of Ethics administers and enforces the state’s Campaign Finance Disclosure Act, and it’s responsible for investigating any possible violations of campaign finance disclosure rules.
In instances where the ethics board undertakes a campaign finance investigation, it would also need to meet a higher bar to issue any subpoenas, and more detailed procedures would govern the subpoenas process.
After an investigation, the ethics board would need to have “probable cause” to justify bringing formal charges against someone for campaign finance violations.
If the board found that a campaign finance violation did occur, before filing any formal charges against the person being investigated, the board would have to create a report of the investigation, provide that report to the person being investigated, and give that person a chance to respond.
These changes related to board investigations are similar to those in another bill that sets stricter rules for how the Board of Ethics investigates potential conflicts of interest, nepotism, and other ethics law violations.

The campaign group said activists on the Rainbow Warrior this week observed a longline fishing operation by the Playa Zahara in the South Fiji Basin.
Georgia Whitaker, a senior campaigner with Greenpeace Australia Pacific, was on board during the operation. She claimed the activists watched as the vessel hauled in and killed three endangered mako sharks in half an hour.
She said a small crew, including a trained shark handler, boarded a support boat to approach the Spanish vessel after releasing 14 animals caught on its line – among them eight near-threatened blue sharks, four swordfish and an endangered longfin mako shark.
The activists also removed more than 210 hooks and 20km of longline.
“It was devastating seeing these beautiful creatures being caught, often on their gills, in their mouth, by huge baited hooks,” Whitaker said. “They were fighting for their lives and then minutes later you’d see blood spilling over the side of the boat.”
Whitaker said the vessel’s crew told Greenpeace they were acting legally and primarily targeting swordfish.
According to the European Union’s reporting to the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC), the Playa Zahara caught more than 600,000kg of blue shark in 2023 in the Pacific Southwest.
Patricia Rodríguez, a spokesperson for Viverdreams Fish, the company that owns Playa Zahara, said in a statement the boat acted in accordance with international law and capturing species such as the mako shark and blue shark was not prohibited.
“The species mentioned by Greenpeace are within the quotas and limits allowed by the competent authorities, and the capture, handling and unloading procedures are controlled and documented, by all the systems established by the EU and Spanish authorities,” Rodríguez said.
The statement accused Greenpeace of “a campaign of disinformation”, violating maritime laws, stealing the fishing gear and posing risks to crews on both vessels by its intervention.
“Our company is strongly committed to the sustainability of marine resources and regularly collaborates with scientists, independent observers and fisheries authorities to ensure compliance with conservation standards,” she said.
A Greenpeace analysis has estimated that almost half a million blue sharks were caught as bycatch in the Pacific Ocean last year – the highest number recorded since 1991.
The same report found nearly 70% of EU longline catches in the region in 2023 were blue sharks.
World leaders will meet in Nice next week for the UN ocean conference to discuss the high seas biodiversity treaty, which Australia signed in 2023 but is yet to ratify.
Greenpeace has urged the government to ratify the treaty within the first 100 days of its second term. The treaty requires 60 countries to ratify it before it comes into force, but as yet only 32 have done so.
Shark fishing is a lucrative global trade, worth an estimated $1bn annually. Global demand for shark meat has doubled in the past two decades.
Dr Leonardo Guida, a shark scientist with the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said the level of exploitation was alarming, given more than one-third of shark and ray species are threatened with extinction globally.
“Sharks are important in the ecosystem, they typically occupy the top of marine food webs,” he said. “Steep population declines will cause food webs to potentially become unstable and ultimately collapse, there is a clear impact their loss could have on food security for a lot of nations.”
Guida said the creation of no-take marine sanctuaries was essential – to preserve marine life and to understand how ecosystems respond to the combined pressures of overfishing and the climate crisis.
“These sanctuaries act as controls,” he said. “They help us compare areas impacted by fishing with those that are not, which is critical to building resilience in ocean wildlife and managing our fisheries in a rapidly changing world, such that we reduce our impact on different species.”",The Guardian,['compliance'],"['Greenpeace', 'New Zealand', 'the Playa Zahara', 'Georgia Whitaker', 'Greenpeace Australia Pacific', 'mako', 'longfin mako shark', 'Whitaker', 'Whitaker', 'Greenpeace', 'the European Union’s', 'Central Pacific Fisheries Commission', 'WCPFC', 'Playa Zahara', 'Patricia Rodríguez', 'Viverdreams Fish', 'Playa Zahara', 'Greenpeace', 'EU', 'Rodríguez', 'Greenpeace', 'Greenpeace', 'EU', 'Nice', 'UN', 'Australia', 'Greenpeace', 'an estimated $1bn', 'Leonardo Guida', 'the Australian Marine Conservation Society', 'Guida']",
Modi inaugurates ambitious rail project connecting Kashmir to Indian plains,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/modi-inaugurates-ambitious-rail-project-connecting-kashmir-indian-122565135,"Fri, 06 Jun 2025 06:06:16 -0400",India Prime Minister Narendra Modi has inaugurated one of the most ambitious and strategic railway projects the nation has ever built,"Modi inaugurates ambitious rail project connecting Kashmir to Indian plains
India Prime Minister Narendra Modi has inaugurated one of the most ambitious and strategic railway projects the nation has ever built
NEW DELHI -- Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday inaugurated one of the most ambitious railway projects ever built in India, which will connect the Kashmir Valley to the vast Indian plains by train for the first time.
Dubbed by government-operated Indian Railways as one of the most challenging tracks in the world, the 272-kilometer (169-mile) line begins in the garrison city of Udhampur in Jammu region and runs through Indian-controlled Kashmir’s main city of Srinagar. The line ends in Baramulla, a town near the highly militarized Line of Control dividing the Himalayan region between India and Pakistan.
The line travels through 36 tunnels and over 943 bridges. The Indian government pegged the total project cost at around $5 billion.
One of the project’s highlights is a 1,315-meter-long (4,314-foot) steel and concrete bridge above the Chenab River connecting two mountains with an arch 359 meters (1,177 feet) above the water. Indian Railways compared the height to the Eiffel Tower in Paris, which stands 330 meters (1,082 feet), and said the bridge is built to last 120 years and endure extreme weather, including wind speeds up to 260 kph (161 mph).
Modi visited the Chenab bridge with tight security, waving an Indian tri-color flag before boarding a test train that passed through picturesque mountains and tunnels to reach an inauguration ceremony for another high-elevation bridge named Anji.
The prime minister also helped launch a pair of new trains called “Vande Bharat” that will halve the travel time between Srinagar and the town of Katra in Jammu to about three hours from the usual six to seven hours by road.
Modi travelled to Indian-controlled Kashmir on Friday for the first time since a military conflict between India and Pakistan brought the nuclear-armed rivals to the brink of their third war over the region last month, when the countries fired missiles and drones at each other.
The conflict began with a gun massacre in late April that left 26 people, mostly Hindu tourists, dead in Indian-controlled Kashmir. India blamed Pakistan for supporting the attackers, a charge Islamabad denied.
Addressing a public rally in Katra, Modi lashed out at Pakistan and alleged Islamabad was behind the massacre. He said the attack was primarily aimed at Kashmir’s flourishing tourism industry and meant to fuel communal violence.
“I promise you, I won’t let developmental activities stop in Kashmir,” Modi said, adding that local industries and businesses will get a boost from the new rail connectivity.
The railway project is considered crucial to boosting tourism and bringing development to a region that has been marred by militancy and protests over the years. The line is expected to ease the movement of Indian troops and the public to the disputed region, which is currently connected by flights and mountain roads that are prone to landslides.
India and Pakistan each administer part of Kashmir, but both claim the territory in its entirety. Militants in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi’s rule since 1989. Many Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels’ goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country.

Analysis-Boeing rebuilding trust as airline bosses see improved jet quality,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysis-boeing-rebuilding-trust-airline-154712916.html,2025-06-05T15:47:12Z,,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Airline bosses are tentatively voicing greater confidence in Boeing's ability to deliver jets at the right quality in a step towards ending years of reputational damage for the embattled planemaker.
An annual summit of airline leaders in New Delhi this week struck a more optimistic tone about Boeing's recovery from overlapping safety, regulatory and industrial crises, though executives stressed Boeing still had much work left to do.
""What we've seen quarter to quarter is an improvement in safety, an improvement in quality,"" Seattle-based Alaska Airlines CEO Ben Minicucci told Reuters at the International Air Transport Association's annual meeting.
""Are they yet there? No, there's still a lot of work.""
In January last year, a door missing four bolts blew off a new Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 MAX jet at 16,000 feet. The ripple effect from the incident caused a crisis throughout the aviation industry, hitting suppliers, carriers and passengers.
Planemakers often have to run the gauntlet of airline criticism at IATA's annual meeting, where IATA head Willie Walsh last year urged Boeing to learn from errors that fuelled a crisis beginning with fatal crashes of two MAX jets in 2018 and 2019.
One of Boeing's most vocal recent critics has been Tim Clark, president of Emirates, the largest customer for big jets like the Boeing 777 and its long-delayed successor the 777X.
At his annual sit-down with reporters at the summit this year, Clark spoke more positively about getting ""clearer messages"" from Boeing's recently appointed leadership.
He welcomed a change of style under CEO Kelly Ortberg, revealing he had never met Ortberg's ousted predecessor Dave Calhoun.
""It was nice to meet the head of Boeing,"" he said.
Clark, whose airline has 205 of the still uncertified 777X on order, suggested growing confidence from Boeing in private.
""When I talk about cautious optimism, in the last few years I had seen none of that"" he said.
Ortberg, who took the helm last August, has said he will address safety and quality concerns and repair trust with regulators, staff and customers.
Boeing customers said the measures are showing some results.
While Boeing is still trying to ramp up production, there have been improvements in quality and visibility of deliveries.
""There is still further to go but it is definitely an improving story,"" said Peter Barrett, CEO of lessor SMBC Aviation, a major leasing company and Boeing customer.
AIRLINE INSPECTORS
Few are taking Boeing's recovery solely on trust.
Alaska Airlines has sent its own quality inspectors to Boeing's production lines and commissioned a quarterly audit.
Alaska's Minicucci said Boeing had put in a ""very diligent, deliberate process"" to reduce out-of-sequence work, a disruption to normal factory flows blamed in part for the oversight of the missing bolts.
He noted that Ortberg, who has moved to Seattle to be closer to the biggest jet plants, and Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stephanie Pope, appointed last March, regularly tour factories.
""They're getting out there, they're walking the floor, they're feeling what's going on,"" Minicucci said. ""I think that's different to what happened in the past.""
Other customers have noted progress, despite a bruising strike last year which halted most of Boeing's jet production.
United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby, who took part in a revolt by U.S. airlines that triggered Calhoun's exit after the Alaska incident, said last week Boeing had ""turned the corner"".
WORK REMAINS TO COMPLETE RECOVERY
Still, few airline chiefs have any illusions about the scale of turnaround needed to restore the status of Boeing factories.
""When I was there last year... I thought this is going nowhere at this rate,"" Clark said, adding he would return this year to see for himself the progress made since then.
Boeing declined to comment on specific airline opinions.
Nor does the brighter public tone mean airlines will necessarily ease pressure in private as they wait for new jets.
But several airline executives at the IATA event acknowledged that Boeing had passed one key test of support at the industry's biggest annual podium, as it slowly stabilises production.
""We have got a lot of work still to do (but) there is a lot of positivity from customers on our performance in the first five months of the year,"" Boeing Senior Vice President of Commercial Sales Brad McMullen said.
It now faces a decisive test as regulators review higher output after Boeing hit a temporary ceiling of 38 MAX jets a month. It also seeks certification of models including the 777X.
The acting head of the Federal Aviation Administration said on Wednesday higher output would not happen straightaway.
Originally due to receive the 777X in 2020, Clark held out little hope of getting the upgraded jet before IATA meets again in June next year. Boeing has said it is now due in 2026.
""The important thing is they get it out and it's certified to the rigours of the new Boeing: the new approach to building aircraft, safety of operation and all the quality controls that they were having difficulties with prior to that,"" Clark said.

WASHINGTON — Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus pledged Thursday to make more visits to immigration detention centers across the country to carry out oversight of the Trump administration’s crackdown.
The members detailed their visits to various detention centers over last week’s recess. Many people they visited in those centers were arrested while attending their court hearings or had no criminal record, they said.
“What we and our colleagues witnessed was the system being used to punish people simply for being an immigrant, and we all know that cruelty is the point with this president,” said New York Democratic Rep. Nydia Velázquez.
Continued oversight of immigration detention centers will only become more important, members of the all-Democrat caucus said, if congressional Republicans succeed in passing a massive tax and spending bill that would increase immigration enforcement funding by billions, including for detention centers.
Republicans are moving ahead with a legislative procedure known as reconciliation to fulfill President Donald Trump’s priorities without needing 60 votes in the U.S. Senate.
The vow to continue with oversight at detention centers comes after three congressional Democrats said they were accosted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials at a New Jersey detention center last month. That incident ended with the Newark Mayor Ras Baraka arrested, and Rep. LaMonica McIver facing federal charges. The charges against Baraka were dismissed about two weeks later.
“We will not succumb to any intimidation tactics,” CHC Chair Rep. Adriano Espaillat of New York said. “We will continue to comply with our duty to have oversight of these detention centers, and we will visit them within the parameters of the law.”
Members of Congress are allowed to conduct oversight visits at any Department of Homeland Security facility that detains immigrants, without prior notice, under provisions of an appropriations law.
Collateral arrests
Washington state Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a former chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, slammed the Trump administration’s expansion of government contracts with private prison companies to detain migrants.
“It is critically important that we members of Congress continue to investigate what are supposed to be civil detention centers, but instead operate as private for-profit prisons with substandard medical care and they make billions of dollars … in contracts from this administration detaining people of all legal statuses,” Jayapal said.
The detention center in New Jersey reopened this year and ICE awarded GEO Group Inc. with a $1 billion contract to run the facility.
Jayapal said when she conducted an oversight visit at the Tacoma, Washington, Northwest ICE Processing Center, which was formerly known as the Northwest Detention Center, over the recess, some of the people being detained were caught up in immigration enforcement raids targeting other people. Such immigration arrests are known as collateral arrests.
She said one woman she spoke to who was detained had been in the country for more than 20 years, but did not have a permanent legal status.
“She was swept up in a raid at the workplace, and she was detained less than a week before she was going to get married to a U.S. citizen,” Jayapal said.
She said another person she talked to was a man who had been in the U.S. for 31 years and is a permanent legal resident.
“These are not the so-called worst of the worst that Trump kept saying he was going to go after,” Jayapal said. “These are simply people who love this country, who have been in this country for decades, who are married to U.S. citizens and have U.S. citizen children, and do not understand why the country they love would be doing this to them.”
Democratic Rep. Lou Correa of California, said that he’s come across immigrants in detention centers who were arrested while attending their court hearings.
“These individuals are following the law, showing up … to court hearings, and they’re having their removal cases dismissed,” he said. “Immediately as they walk out of that courtroom, they are rearrested and put into what is called an expedited removal process … to quickly get them out of the country.”

Federal health agency says emergency abortion care guidance doesn’t reflect administration policy

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has rescinded guidance issued in July 2022 that emphasized hospitals are responsible for providing emergency abortion care despite state bans, saying it does not reflect the Trump administration’s policy.
The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) is a federal law requiring hospitals that accept Medicare funding to provide stabilizing treatment to anyone who comes to an emergency room seeking care. After the Dobbs decision in June 2022 that allowed states to regulate abortion access and more than a dozen states implemented total abortion bans, the Health and Human Services Department under former Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration issued guidance reinforcing hospitals’ obligations to patients under EMTALA, regardless of state policy. Abortion is a form of stabilizing care in certain situations, such as when a pregnant patient’s water breaks prematurely and the fetus is not yet viable.
“(Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) will continue to enforce EMTALA, which protects all individuals who present to a hospital emergency department seeking examination or treatment, including for identified emergency medical conditions that place the health of a pregnant woman or her unborn child in serious jeopardy,” the Tuesday announcement said. “CMS will work to rectify any perceived legal confusion and instability created by the former administration’s actions.”
The statement did not elaborate further on what that will mean in cases where the EMTALA mandate conflicts with state abortion bans. In court, Idaho’s attorneys arguing on behalf of the state have said EMTALA never requires an abortion to be performed as part of stabilizing care — an argument also made by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito when the court heard Idaho’s case last year. The justices sent the case back to the circuit court for further consideration, but the Trump administration dropped the Biden-era lawsuit against Idaho in early March.
Confusion over maternal care medication plagues politics in Louisiana and beyond
Abortion-rights advocacy organizations said the move sends a clear message that the administration is siding with anti-abortion foes.
“Stripping away federal guidance affirming what the law requires will put lives at risk,” said Fatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women’s Law Center, in a statement. “To be clear: this action doesn’t change hospitals’ legal obligations, but it does add to the fear, confusion, and dangerous delays patients and providers have faced since the fall of Roe v. Wade.”
Doctors in places like Idaho, where the Biden administration sued over the state’s near-total abortion ban as it relates to EMTALA, have said the ban is what created confusion. Court injunctions have been in place off and on through litigation over the past three years, and when it wasn’t in place for a four-month period in 2024, staff at the state’s largest hospital airlifted six patients to other states because there was uncertainty about whether they could be prosecuted under the state law. Patients can also file complaints under the EMTALA law, and if the hospital is found to be in violation, it could lose its status and funding as a Medicare provider.
St. Luke’s, the state’s largest hospital system, filed a new lawsuit as the plaintiff in January, anticipating that the Trump Department of Justice would drop it. The federal judge in that case issued a new injunction protecting St. Luke’s doctors from prosecution under the state ban, but other Idaho doctors outside of that health system are not protected by it.
The federal health agency also rescinded a letter written by Biden’s former HHS secretary, Xavier Becerra, that told U.S. health care providers the federal statute protected their clinical judgment and the actions they take to provide stabilizing treatment, regardless of the state where they practice.
There have been several lawsuits over EMTALA since 2022 besides in Idaho, including one in Tennessee filed in January by the Catholic Medical Association that specifically challenged the July 2022 guidance. The Association said the Biden-era memo and accompanying letter were issued without conducting proper administrative procedure, and alleged that it violated the religious freedom of doctors.
On Tuesday, when DHHS rescinded the guidance, the Association dropped the lawsuit.
Regina Davis Moss, president and CEO of a reproductive health and sexuality advocacy organization called In Our Own Voice, is a former HHS employee and longtime advocate for better reproductive health outcomes for Black women and girls and nonbinary people. Moss said Black women are already two to three times more likely to die during pregnancy than white women, and this policy change on EMTALA will only serve to make those statistics worse.
“We’re changing the whole scope and spirit of why we had to have EMTALA in the first place,” Moss said. “It’s leading to delays in care, and it’s putting pregnant people’s lives at risk.”

Musk says Trump is in the 'Epstein files.' Here's where the president has shown up in unsealed records.,https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-trump-epstein-files-2025-6,2025-06-06T17:00:24Z,The many Jeffrey Epstein-related documents that have already been released do not implicate Donald Trump in any sex-trafficking.,"- Elon Musk says the ""Epstein files"" haven't been released because Trump is in them.
- The president's name has cropped up repeatedly in Epstein-related court documents.
- Trump's name is included in Epstein's contact book and flight records.
Elon Musk has an allegation about why President Donald Trump hasn't released all of the so-called ""Epstein files.""
He's in them.
Musk's claim, tying the president to the dead financier and sex trafficker, is the latest punch in the escalating beef between the richest man in the world and the president of the United States.
""Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public,"" Musk posted on X Thursday afternoon. ""Have a nice day, DJT!""
""Mark this post for the future,"" he added in a follow-up post. ""The truth will come out.""
Musk didn't elaborate on his claim or provide evidence that backed up his assertion. House Democrats nonetheless seized on Musk's claim, with two members of the oversight committee demanding a response from Justice Department officials.
Trump's relationship with Epstein has long been part of the public record. None of that record supports any notion that the president was involved in Epstein's sex trafficking.
The two were friends in the 1980s, spending time in the same wealthy social circles in Palm Beach and Manhattan, and Trump's name has repeatedly come up in litigation related to Epstein. The two had a falling-out in the 2000s.
Trump has previously denied involvement in any wrongdoing related to Epstein. In 2019, following criminal charges against the financier, Trump said he ""wasn't a fan.""
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday that Musk's claims about Trump and Epstein were ""unfortunate.""
""This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted,"" Leavitt said in a statement. ""The President is focused on passing this historic piece of legislation and making our country great again.""
During his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump indicated he supported making government documents related to Epstein public if he were elected.
It's not clear exactly what Musk meant by the ""Epstein files."" Attorney General Pamela Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel have promised to release documents in possession of the Justice Department related to the wealthy pedophile.
Other agencies that may have Epstein-related documents, like the CIA, have been publicly silent about the matter.
We already have a lot of Epstein documents
Bondi and Patel have published one batch of documents, in February.
Aside from a three-page list of evidence seized during a 2019 criminal investigation into Epstein, it included only information that had previously been made public during the criminal case against his associate Ghislaine Maxwell and in other civil litigation.
Among those records are a copy of one of Epstein's contact books, which lists Trump and some of Trump's family members among hundreds of entries. The records also include some flight logs for Epstein's private jets; Trump is mentioned as a passenger.
Trump's Mar-a-Lago club featured prominently in Maxwell's criminal trial. One woman who said Epstein raped her testified that the financier took her to the club when she was 14 years old and introduced her to Trump. Another of Epstein's most prominent accusers, Virginia Giuffre, who died by suicide in April, has said she was recruited as a victim by Maxwell while at Mar-a-Lago. A Mar-a-Lago employee briefly testified at Maxwell's criminal trial about Giuffre's father's employment at the club.
Trump's name has also been included in long-running civil litigation related to Epstein. Documents including Trump's name became public in January 2024, when a federal judge unsealed and unredacted thousands of pages of court documents in a lawsuit that Giuffre brought against Maxwell. The judge had previously referred to Trump with the pseudonym ""Doe 174.""
The lawsuit did not accuse Trump of any wrongdoing. Many of the people whose names were initially kept under seal in the court documents were identified as Epstein's victims or had only an incidental connection to the financier.
The documents from that lawsuit include excerpts of a deposition by Johanna Sjoberg, who has accused Epstein of rape. At one point during the deposition, Sjoberg was asked about giving massages to various associates of Epstein at his residences, and she denied giving any to Trump. Asked about a trip to Atlantic City, she described visiting one of Trump's casinos after flying on Epstein's private jet.
""Jeffrey said, 'Great, we'll call up Trump, and we'll go to' — I don't recall the name of the casino, but — 'we'll go to the casino,'"" Sjoberg said in the deposition.
Other documents mention Trump only in passing, referencing him as one of the many high-profile people who have been friends with Epstein.
Epstein — who also spent time with other powerful figures, including Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, Steve Bannon, and Ehud Barak — died by suicide in a federal Manhattan jail while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges in 2019. As part of the same investigation, Justice Department prosecutors brought sex-trafficking charges against his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted in late 2021 and sentenced to 20 years in prison.
Musk was famously photographed with Maxwell at a 2014 Vanity Fair event. He has said she ""photobombed"" him.
The Tesla CEO has denied a connection to Epstein. Following a 2023 subpoena in litigation related to JPMorgan's ties to Epstein, Musk said he never took financial advice from him.

A Russian missile and drone attack across Ukraine kills 4 in the capital,https://www.nbcnews.com/world/ukraine/ukraine-russian-missile-drone-rcna211358,"Fri, 06 Jun 2025 01:28:24 GMT","A Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv early Friday killed at least four people and injured 20 others, city mayor Vitali Klitschko said.","KYIV, Ukraine — A Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv early Friday killed at least four people and injured 20 others, city mayor Vitali Klitschko said. It was part of a wider overnight assault that became the latest in a series of large-scale attacks targeting regions across Ukraine.
Klitschko said search and rescue operations were underway at several locations.
Multiple explosions were heard for hours in the capital, Kyiv, where falling debris set off fires across several districts as air defense systems attempted to intercept incoming targets, said Tymur Tkachenko, head of the Kyiv City Administration.
“Our air defense crews are doing everything possible. But we must protect one another — stay safe,” Tkachenko wrote on Telegram, urging people to seek shelter.
Fourteen-year-old Kyiv resident Vitalina Vasylchenko sheltered in a parking garage with her 6-year-old sister and their mother after an explosion blew one of their windows off its hinges.
“I heard a buzzing sound, then my dad ran to me and covered me with his hand, then there was a very loud explosion,” she said. “My whole life flashed before my eyes, I already thought that was it. I started having a panic attack... I’m shocked that I’m alive.”
Ukraine’s human rights chief, Dmytro Lubinets, called for a strong international response to Russia’s latest overnight attack, saying the assault violated basic human rights.
“Russia is acting like a terrorist, systematically targeting civilian infrastructure,” Lubinets wrote on Telegram. “The world must respond clearly and take concrete steps, including condemning the aggressor’s actions.”
Authorities reported damage in several districts in Kyiv, and rescue workers were responding at multiple locations.
Ukraine’s Interior Ministry said three emergency workers were killed in Kyiv while responding to the aftermath of Russian strikes. “They were working under fire to help people,” the ministry said in a statement.
In Solomyanskyi district, a fire broke out on the 11th floor of a 16-story residential building. Emergency services evacuated three people from the apartment, and rescue operations were ongoing. Another fire broke out in a metal warehouse.
Tkachenko said the metro tracks between two stations in Kyiv were damaged in the attack, but no fire or injuries occurred.
More than 2,000 households in Kyiv’s eastern bank remained without electricity Friday following the overnight Russian attack, the Kyiv City Administration said.
The attack targeted at least six regions across Ukraine, leaving a trail of civilian injuries, damaged infrastructure and disrupted utilities.
The number of people injured in a Russian attack on the western city of Ternopil early Friday rose to 10, including five emergency workers, regional governor Viacheslav Nehoda said. The strike damaged industrial and infrastructure facilities, left parts of the city without electricity, and disrupted water supplies.
Three people were injured in Ukraine’s central Poltava region following a Russian attack there that damaged administrative buildings, warehouses and a cafe, regional head Volodymyr Kohut said. Fires caused by the strike have been extinguished, and debris also fell on a private home.
Russian forces also struck the Khmelnytskyi region overnight, damaging a private residential building, outbuildings, a fence and several vehicles, regional governor Serhii Tiuryn said.
Meanwhile, air defense forces shot down three Russian missiles over the western Lviv region overnight, regional head Maksym Kozytskyi said.
In northern Chernihiv region, a Shahed drone exploded near an apartment building, shattering windows and doors, according to regional military administration chief Dmytro Bryzhynskyi. He added that explosions from ballistic missiles were also recorded on the outskirts of the city.
The nighttime attack came hours after U.S. President Donald Trump said it might be better to let Ukraine and Russia “fight for a while” before pulling them apart and pursuing peace, in comments that were a remarkable detour from Trump’s often-stated appeals to stop the three-year war.
Trump spoke as he met with Germany’s new chancellor, Friedrich Merz, who appealed to him as the “key person in the world” who could halt the bloodshed by pressuring Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Russia’s Defense Ministry said that air defenses downed 174 Ukrainian drones over 13 regions early Friday.

As feds resume student loan collections, states try to catch borrowers before they sink
States can’t cancel the debt, but they are filling gaps in information.

Over the past few months, Celina Damian’s phone has been ringing off the hook with one bewildered, anxious question after another: “What kind of loan is this?” “Am I in default?” “Will the government really take my wages?”
“Sometimes they just don’t know where to start,” said Damian, California’s student loan servicing ombudsperson.
“I’m talking to borrowers from all ages, from new borrowers to — I have 80-, 90-year-old borrowers,” she said.
The federal government last month restarted collections on defaulted loans. State student loan ombudspersons such as Damian have become some of the only sources of contact for worried borrowers lost in a tangle of conflicting information at the federal level about their loan status and repayment options.
The U.S. Department of Education began collecting on defaulted student loans in May for the first time since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.
Federal student loans issued by the U.S. Department of Education come with fixed rates, set repayment plans and borrower protections. Private servicers handle billing, repayment-plan enrollments and defaults.
More than 5 million borrowers are in delinquency, and nearly 10 million — about 25% of the federal student loan portfolio — are at risk of default within months, according to data from the U.S. Department of Education.
States can’t cancel that debt, but they do register and oversee servicers operating in their states, run ombuds offices, tweak tax rules and offer outreach or limited grants — actions aimed at reducing defaults and the economic fallout.
When borrowers default, states will likely feel the economic impact. They might lose tax revenue as homebuying stalls. They could end up paying more for Medicaid and social services if borrowers need to rely on them. And students with loan debt may be reluctant to go into lower-paying public-sector work, leading to staffing shortages at state agencies.
A borrower is considered delinquent after missing a payment to the servicing companies that handle billing, repayment plan enrollments, and defaults.
Damian’s office, established under California’s Student Borrower Bill of Rights, began as a narrow statutory role but now serves as a hub for outreach, “Student Loan 101” workshops and escalated complaints to federal agencies.
Roughly 16 states plus the District of Columbia have followed suit, creating ombuds offices to guide borrowers through confusing paperwork and misinformation. Damian believes these ombuds offices should be in every state, as borrowers across the country will likely have similar questions and little help at the federal level.
“If you don’t have an ombudsperson or even just a person at the state level who can educate borrowers, that will make a difference,” Damian told Stateline. “These borrowers are trying to pay, but the system is broken. No other financial product works this way.”
Student loans became a key issue during last year’s election race, with President Joe Biden blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court in his effort to offer relief to 40 million Americans. In its waning days, his administration did forgive loans for some 150,000 borrowers under previous programs.
But President Donald Trump opposes most loan forgiveness programs, and in May, the U.S. Education Department issued a “Dear Colleague” letter to higher education institutions, reminding them of their legal obligations to help former students understand repayment responsibilities and access support.
These borrowers are trying to pay, but the system is broken. No other financial product works this way.

Some conservative economists say that federal loan forgiveness and financial aid hurt all students, offering colleges an incentive to raise tuition or lower their own institutional aid.
Winston Berkman-Breen, the legal director at the Student Borrower Protection Center, a nonprofit aimed at protecting borrowers and improving the repayment system, said that more than 2 million borrowers are stuck in a backlog of unprocessed applications for income-driven repayment (IDR) plans — calculated pay structures meant to keep payments affordable based on a borrower’s income.
Other borrowers have called federal agencies for help only to find that U.S. Education Department staff, including servicer-oversight teams, have been laid off as the Trump administration works toward dismantling the department entirely.
“There was an expectation to repay,” Berkman-Breen said. “But there was also an expectation that people would have access to affordable plans. That promise has broken down.”
States now have three primary tools to address student loan debt, Berkman-Breen said: enforcement actions to protect consumers, such as the 39-state lawsuit against servicer Navient; legal oversight by suing to uphold or challenge federal policy; and direct outreach to help public servants access Public Service Loan Forgiveness and similar programs.
Nineteen states now require registration for companies that service student loans, he said. And more than a dozen states align with federal policy to exempt forgiven loan balances from state income taxes.
‘Can’t wait for Washington’
Connecticut state Rep. Eleni Kavros DeGraw, a Democrat, calls student debt “a drag on the economy,” and said states can’t afford to wait for Congress — mired in partisan gridlock over student loan forgiveness — to find common ground.
“[Student debt] is stopping people from buying homes, starting families and fully participating in the economy,” she told Stateline. “That hurts us as a state, as a city, and we can’t wait for Washington to figure it out.”
Last year, Connecticut created a bipartisan reimbursement program that provides up to $20,000 for graduates of local colleges who make payments and complete community service. The state has distributed more than $2 million so far.
Kavros DeGraw hopes the program can serve as a model, and has already talked with lawmakers in other states on possibly developing their own versions of it.
“These were people who were already paying,” Kavros DeGraw said. “It just made sense. I think it’s something that other states could explore this session, and it would provide an immense deal of relief.”
Lawmakers in other states also have considered student loan legislation. This year, New Jersey introduced bills to register education lenders and cap interest rates. Lawmakers in New Mexico, New York and North Carolina have proposed Borrower Bill of Rights legislation. Arizona has a registration bill for private servicers. None of these measures has advanced far.
According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, more than 20 states have enacted laws expanding loan forgiveness, repayment programs and servicer oversight in recent years.
Several states are also investing directly in workforce-aligned loan forgiveness: Georgia expanded its service-cancelable loan program to cover dental students working in rural areas. Idaho created a loan repayment incentive for rural nurses. Kentucky now offers $5,000 stipends to attract new teachers. Maryland authorized Anne Arundel County to launch a local forgiveness program for public school educators.
Repayment
Student loan stress is not evenly distributed. Seven states, all with Republican‐controlled legislatures, report delinquency rates above 30% among borrowers required to make payments.
Mississippi leads the nation with a conditional delinquency rate of nearly 45% — meaning borrowers who should be making payments are late. That’s just ahead of Alabama, West Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana, all of which have rates above 31%, according to recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
By contrast, Illinois, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont and New Hampshire maintain delinquency rates below 15%.
Experts say this chasm reflects deeper systemic differences, such as lower median incomes in higher delinquency states, along with weaker consumer protections and a higher share of students attending for-profit institutions or leaving college without a degree.
States also have promoted the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, established in 2007, that offers help to public service professionals. New Mexico has an outreach campaign that includes prospective teachers and health care workers. Maine has provided guidance to public defenders on how they can take advantage of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program and touts a related state tax credit on a marketing site to lure new residents.
“States can regulate and enforce, but they can’t fix the structural problems in how repayment is administered,” said Michele Zampini, senior director of college affordability at The Institute for College Access & Success, a research organization that advocates for students. “They’re helping around the edges, but the core system is still broken.”
A November report from the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau found at least 3.9 million borrowers received misleading or inaccurate bills from servicing companies.
“The repayment system is not in a good place to provide the services and repayment options borrowers are legally entitled to,” Zampini said.
The Student Loan Borrower Survey, conducted between October 2023 and January 2024, found that 61% of borrowers who received debt relief made a beneficial life change earlier than they otherwise could have. Yet borrower awareness remains dangerously low: Nearly 42% of federal borrowers have only been on the standard repayment plan, and 31% of those didn’t know other options, such as an income-based plan, existed.
In California, a major part of Damian’s job in the past few months has been to help borrowers access existing forgiveness programs.
Meanwhile, new federal policy proposals could reshape repayment entirely. The Trump-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act would consolidate existing IDR plans into a single tiered structure, with lower-income borrowers paying flat monthly rates and higher earners contributing 8% of their income. The bill also proposes extending standard repayment terms to 30 years — raising concerns it could delay forgiveness and inflate total interest costs.
The bill passed the U.S. House and is pending in the Senate.
‘Incentive to hike prices’
Andrew Gillen, a Cato Institute research fellow who recently testified before Congress, argues that any meaningful fix must address the incentives driving rising tuition — namely, federal aid being tied directly to college sticker prices.
“The link between rising tuition and increasing aid is what drives the Bennett Hypothesis, where federal student aid, in the form of loans, can lead to higher tuition costs at colleges and universities,” Gillen said in an interview. “If we instead use the median cost of attendance to calculate aid eligibility, we remove colleges’ incentive to hike prices just to capture more aid.”
Even without agreement on blanket forgiveness, experts agree on smaller bipartisan steps: streamlined repayment, stronger servicer oversight and targeted help for borrowers with the greatest need.
“We don’t want people defaulting. We don’t want payments that are too high for people just out of school. That should be the bipartisan starting point,” Zampini said.

The three orders will be critical to American safety and security, White House officials involved in the drafting of the orders indicated, particularly in light of major worldwide events coming to the United States in the next few years, such as the World Cup and the Olympics.
In addition to bolstering safety and security, the new orders will also spur greater innovation in the aerospace and drone sectors, something White House officials said has been stifled in recent years as a result of burdensome regulations.
""Flying cars are not just for the Jetsons,"" Michael Kratsios, a lead tech policy advisor at the White House said. ""Since the beginning of his first term, President Trump has recognized the incredible potential of drones to boost American productivity, create high-skilled jobs and meet national needs in areas like public safety, infrastructure, inspection, agriculture and more. But, for too long, red tape has hindered homegrown drone innovation, restricting commercial drone use and burdening their development.""
Kratsios said the same about supersonic aviation, noting ""Americans should be able to fly from New York to LA in under four hours.""
Besides promoting innovation, the orders seek to shore up American airspace sovereignty. This directive is aimed at not only addressing potentially criminal or terror-related threats. It also aims to increase penalties for and reduce the prevalence of drone misuse in American airspace.
""The president week one wanted us to take this issue seriously because of the national fury over the events over New Jersey,"" Sebastian Gorka, senior director of counterterrorism on the Trump administration's National Security Council, said of the new executive orders signed Friday.
""For far too many years, we have not had a requisite, necessary federal response — not only to the dominance of non-U.S. platforms in this field, but also protecting sensitive sites, military sites, critical infrastructure, but also just sporting events, mass events.""
REBECCA GRANT: AMERICA HAS A DRONE PROBLEM, AND NO ONE IS IN CHARGE
White House officials who advised the president on these new executive orders said there will be more protection for critical infrastructure for sporting venues as a result of the new directives, including the upcoming FIFA World Cup. They will also enable ""routine beyond visual line of sight commercial operations,"" such as drone deliveries, infrastructure maintenance and emergency response to incidents like wildfires.

The orders will also reduce the United States' reliance on foreign countries for drone and other aviation technology, officials added.
""These executive orders will accelerate American innovation in drones, flying cars and supersonic aircraft and chart the future of America's skies for years to come,"" Kratsios said. ""Our message is simple. American innovation belongs in American aerospace.""",FOX News,"['executive order', 'executive order']","['Donald Trump', 'White House', 'the United States', 'the World Cup', 'Olympics', 'White House', 'Jetsons', 'Michael Kratsios', 'the White House', 'Trump', 'Kratsios', 'New York', 'LA', 'New Jersey', 'Sebastian Gorka', 'Trump', 'National Security Council', 'U.S.', 'White House', 'FIFA World Cup', 'FOX', ""the United States'"", 'America', 'Kratsios']",Threats to Research and Higher Education Funding from Heightened Regulatory Change and Scrutiny

The spirited celebration of WorldPride, the peripatetic biennial international festival in support of LGBTQ+ rights which kicks off this month and is taking place in Washington DC, was staged instead at the Strathmore Music Center in Maryland, just north of the capital.
Sequin-clad drag queen Peaches Christ acted as host and New York drag queen Thorgy Thor played a violin solo to Beyoncé’s Crazy in Love to an audience of 1,166 people.
The orchestra had hoped to play at the Kennedy Center, Washington’s premier performing arts center, but shortly after returning to the White House, Donald Trump pledged on social media that there would be, in all-caps: “No more drag shows, or other anti-American propaganda” at the public-private arts space.
The Trump administration has issued executive orders limiting transgender rights, banned transgender people from serving in the armed forces, and rescinded anti-discrimination policies for LGBTQ+ people as part of a campaign to repeal diversity, equity and inclusion programs.
Michael Roest, conductor and founder of the International Pride Orchestra, a non-profit, reminded the audience that “people don’t feel safe to live and love openly”.
“That is the reason why we have this orchestra,” he said.
During the event, the Gay Men’s Chorus of Washington sang American the Beautiful, and a pianist, Sara Davis Buechner, who is transgender, dazzled while leading the orchestra on grand piano in the Gershwin favorite Rhapsody in Blue.
Both Stars and Stripes and rainbow flags were hoisted at the close.
Trump in February fired the leadership of the Kennedy Center, named himself chair and put a loyalist in charge.
The center then sent Roest a message that said: “We are not in a position at this time to advance a contract,” according to an email chain seen by Reuters, after months of prior negotiations. Considering themselves “disinvited”, event organizers began looking for alternative venues and the Strathmore offered its space, an orchestra spokesperson said.

U.S. laws have largely shielded gunmakers from liability when their firearms are used in crimes.The justices also agreed that a Catholic charity in Wisconsin should not have to pay state unemployment taxes while other faith groups were exempted. The group said that was a violation of its First Amendment rights.A third decision made it easier to claim so-called reverse discrimination in the workplace. That case centered on an Ohio woman who claimed she was passed over for positions and even demoted because she is straight.President Trump says trade talks between the world's two biggest economies will resume following weeks of rising tensions. That comes after Mr. Trump held what he called a very good phone call with Chinese leader Xi Jinping earlier today.

Earlier today, an immigration judge had ordered Marcelo Gomes Da Silva released on a $2,000 bond. Protester: Release Marcelo Gomes now! Protesters: Release Marcelo Gomes now! Geoff Bennett: Public support for the 18-year-old had been growing steadily since his arrest last weekend. Authorities said they were actually looking for the teenager's father, who owns the car his son was driving when he was detained.Following his release, Gomes da Silva described what happened when an officer confronted him. Marcelo Gomes Da Silva, Detained By ICE: He gave me no reason to stop me, no reason for a traffic stop, nothing. And, apparently, they say they're trying to get my dad, but I'm here, not my dad, so that doesn't make sense. Geoff Bennett: Gomes da Silva came to the U.S. from Brazil when he was 7 on a tourist visa. He was later issued a student visa, which has since lapsed.In the Middle East, Israel said today it recovered the bodies of two Israeli-American hostages who were kidnapped in Hamas' October 7 attack. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the military brought the remains of Judy Weinstein and Gad Haggai back to Israel after a special operation in Gaza overnight.Meantime, Gaza health official say Israeli airstrikes today killed at least 13 people, including three journalists who were struck in the courtyard of a hospital. The Israeli military said it targeted a militant operating there.And in Southern Gaza, aid distribution resumed today at two sites run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. The group shut its locations yesterday following several fatal shootings near its operations.Turning now to New Zealand, where Parliament suspended three Maori lawmakers today over a traditional dance they performed to protest a contentious bill. A majority of members voted for the temporary removals today, saying the lawmakers acted in a potentially intimidating manner.

President Donald Trump is moving to block nearly all foreign students from entering the country to attend Harvard University, his latest attempt to choke the Ivy League school from an international pipeline that accounts for a quarter of the student body
WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is moving to block nearly all foreign students from entering the country to attend Harvard University, his latest attempt to choke the Ivy League school from an international pipeline that accounts for a quarter of the student body.
In an executive order signed Wednesday, Trump declared that it would jeopardize national security to allow Harvard to continue hosting foreign students on its campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
“I have determined that the entry of the class of foreign nationals described above is detrimental to the interests of the United States because, in my judgment, Harvard’s conduct has rendered it an unsuitable destination for foreign students and researchers,” Trump wrote in the order.
It’s a further escalation in the White House’s fight with the nation’s oldest and wealthiest university. A federal court in Boston blocked the Department of Homeland Security from barring international students at Harvard last week. Trump’s order invokes a different legal authority.
Trump invoked a broad federal law that gives the president authority to block foreigners whose entry would be “detrimental to the interests of the United States.” On Wednesday, he cited the same authority when announcing that citizens of 12 countries would be banned from visiting the U.S. and those from seven others would face restrictions. Trump’s Harvard order cites several other laws, too, including one barring foreigners associated with terrorist organizations.
In a statement Wednesday night, Harvard said it will “continue to protect its international students.”
“This is yet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard’s First Amendment rights,” university officials said.
It stems from Harvard’s refusal to submit to a series of demands made by the federal government. It has escalated recently after the Department of Homeland Security said Harvard refused to provide records related to misconduct by foreign students.
Harvard says it has complied with the request, but the government said the school's response was insufficient.
The dispute has been building for months after the Trump administration demanded a series of policy and governance changes at Harvard, calling it a hotbed of liberalism and accusing it of tolerating anti-Jewish harassment. Harvard defied the demands, saying they encroached on the university’s autonomy and represented a threat to the freedom of all U.S. universities.
Trump officials have repeatedly raised the stakes and sought new fronts to pressure Harvard, cutting more than $2.6 billion in research grants and moving to end all federal contracts with the university. The latest threat has targeted Harvard’s roughly 7,000 international students, who account for half the enrollment at some Harvard graduate schools.
“Admission to the United States to study at an ‘elite’ American university is a privilege, not a right,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a post on X. “This Department of Justice will vigorously defend the President’s proclamation suspending the entry of new foreign students at Harvard University based on national security concerns.”
Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., called the measure ridiculous and said it has nothing to do with national security.
“It’s a thinly veiled revenge ploy in Trump’s personal feud with Harvard, and continued authoritarian overreach against free speech,” Jayapal said on the social media site X.
The order applies to all students attempting to enter the United States to attend Harvard after the date of the executive order. It provides a loophole to allow students whose entry would “benefit the national interest,” as determined by federal officials.
Trump’s order alleges that Harvard provided data on misconduct by only three students in response to the Homeland Security request, and it lacked the detail to gauge if federal action was needed. Trump concluded that Harvard is either “not fully reporting its disciplinary records for foreign students or is not seriously policing its foreign students.”
“These actions and failures directly undermine the Federal Government’s ability to ensure that foreign nationals admitted on student or exchange visitor visas remain in compliance with Federal law,” the order said.
For foreign students already at Harvard, Secretary of State Marco Rubio will determine if visas should be revoked, Trump wrote.
The order is scheduled to last six months. Within 90 days, the administration will determine if it should be renewed, the order said.
A State Department cable sent last week to U.S. embassies and consulates said federal officials will begin reviewing the social media accounts of visa applicants who plan to attend, work at or visit Harvard University for any signs of antisemitism.
In a court filing last week, Harvard officials said the Trump administration’s efforts to stop Harvard from enrolling international students have created an environment of “profound fear, concern, and confusion.” Countless international students have asked about transferring from the university, Harvard immigration services director Maureen Martin said in the filing. ___

Exclusive: OpenEvidence aims to be ‘Disney+’ with new JAMA deal
OpenEvidence this morning announced it has a new multi-year deal with JAMA to make full-text content from the American Medical Association‘s 13 journals available in its artificial intelligence-powered search engine for medical evidence. For example, a doctor searching for the efficacy of xanomeline-tropsime chloride (a schizophrenia medication) will see detailed results, including charts, pulled from a recent JAMA publication. The company earlier this year announced a similar deal with the New England Journal of Medicine. The company’s CEO and founder Daniel Nadler told me the company’s approach here is like Disney+. Doctors who want to search for information published by top journals and specialty societies will need to use OpenEvidence, just like people who want to stream Moana will need to go to Disney.
A streaming service isn’t the comparison that immediately comes to mind for OpenEvidence. Founded in 2022, the service uses a conversational prompt interface and generates responses much like OpenAI‘s ChatGPT, and OpenEvidence is competing with products like UpToDate that doctors use to search for evidence when making clinical decisions. From the earliest days, Nadler said the big differentiator for OpenEvidence, compared to generative AI chatbots, was that it cites its sources. He said that company has taken care to design the system so that it doesn’t invent answers the way other generative AI products do — in many cases, the service will respond to queries with verbatim text from studies. He said OpenEvidence is fundamentally a search product designed for the very narrow use case of doctors looking for medical evidence. He said the company’s “most valuable secret sauce” is a machine learning search algorithm, and he compared the company’s technology to “a really phenomenal colored number sticky system” that a student might use to label a textbook for an open book exam. The product is free for doctors and supported by advertising. The search is HIPAA compliant.
So far, OpenEvidence has produced impressive numbers. Nadler said that about 350,000 doctors have registered and on average the company fields “7.2 million clinical consultations a month.” OpenEvidence recently announced a $75 million fundraise led by Sequoia at a $1 billion valuation. It was recently reported that the company is in talks Google Ventures and Kleiner Perkins to raise over $100 million more — Nadler didn’t confirm the raise but confirmed that those firms are investors in OpenEvidence.
Are you a doctor using OpenEvidence or other AI search tools in your practice? We’re hoping to speak to as many as possible. Reach out if so.
Takeaways from Medicare’ big DC tech party
A who’s who of health IT leaders descended on the Hubert Humphrey building in DC on Tuesday for an invite-only event about how the federal health department’s Medicare agency and its health IT regulator might better facilitate the flow of data in the health care system. In recent weeks, Medicare officials have been beating the tech modernization drum. They hope to stimulate the development of more advanced tech products, including AI tools to help people manage their health.
My invite must’ve gotten lost in the mail, but a few takeaways from what I heard:
- CMS spelled out five priority tech areas it hopes to work on, including a few I hinted at in my story last week — a simpler digital identity authentication system for Medicare, and a national provider directory. The agency said will expand its Blue Button API that allows developers to help patients access their data, and it will plow forward with Data at the Point of Care, an initiative to make Medicare claims data easily accessible to providers so they can better understand a patient’s medical history. Finally, and most provocatively, the agency said it will participate in “trusted data exchange.”
- That last one is kind of a doozy! As Lisa Bari, an executive at Innovaccer and a former CMS official, pointed out on LinkedIn, it was a Rorschach Test— people saw what they wanted to see. If you are in favor of TEFCA (the government supported data sharing framework that’s been inching forward), you saw this as an endorsement of TEFCA. If you are against TEFCA and prefer to see the government support open standards that allow all manner of data sharing frameworks to flourish, you saw the failure to spell out T-E-F-C-A as a very telling omission. As I reported in STAT Health Tech earlier in the week, a health department budget document for 2026 suggested that ASTP/ONC, the HHS IT regulator, will continue to support TEFCA. Is there a disconnect between ASTP and CMS here?
- It’s notable that CMS announced its plans as health care organizations are mulling responses to an expansive request for information meant to inform its thinking. I’m not saying that the RFI won’t be carefully read by people at CMS, and that it won’t guide policy. But it’s been clear from the very beginning that the super detailed RFI came from leaders who very much have plans in mind.
I’m following the Medicare RFI and its tech modernization agenda closely. I’d love to hear your thoughts about it. Please reach out.
CHAI descends on Stanford, teasing NIH news
Brittany Trang writes with updates related to the Coalition for Health AI:
- Earlier this week, the organization announced that Pacific AI, an AI governance and compliance organization, will go through CHAI’s new assurance service provider certification process and join CHAI’s list of approved vendors. What’s assurance service provider certification? Check out Brittany’s recent AI Prognosis to learn about CHAI’s pivot from “assurance labs” to this broader certification for services across the AI lifecycle. Interestingly, Pacific AI will help CHAI write the standards that will be used to CHAI-certify AI governance providers, including itself — which seems like a conflict of interest. When asked about this, a CHAI spokesperson said that vendors, health systems, attorneys and others are helping them write these standards and that it’s “consistent with all of our other working groups and thought processes around gaining consensus.”
- Also, CHAI’s big summit is taking place today and tomorrow at Stanford, and National Institutes of Health principal deputy director Matthew Memoli is slated to “share AI-related news” at the conference. Stay tuned for an update.
FDA AI updates, an Eli Lilly app, and more
- On Monday, Brittany Trang broke the news that FDA was set to release it generative AI tool, Elsa, to workers. Brittany has fresh intel on the tool, how the rollout is going, and what industry thinks of it in her AI Prognosis newsletter.
- Welldoc announced that it’s the developer behind a new app meant to support people on Eli Lilly‘s GLP-1 medications. It includes features like medication reminders, medication information, and educational content. Welldoc is best known for its apps that support people with diabetes.
- Yahoo Finance reported that CVS Health plans to spend $20 billion (!) on a broad effort to improve the consumer experience of health care. Executive Keith Shah spelled out some of the ambitions on LinkedIn.
- h2, a platform for information about providers, acquired Veda Data Solutions, which works on ensuring accuracy of provider data. h2 earlier this year acquired Ribbon Health, another company working in the provider data space.
- TeleTracking, a platform that helps hospitals manage operations, has a new deal with Palantir Technologies to develop analytics for applications like optimizing staffing.
- Rune Labs, developer of an app for tracking Parkinson’s disease symptoms for the Apple Watch, is working with the Parkinson’s Foundation on research to correlate genetic data of people with the disease to digital data. A few years ago, I wrote about Rune and others using the Apple Watch to help people manage their Parkinson’s.
- Two former Ginkgo Bioworks employees, including Renee Wegrzyn, the former head of federal health moonshot agency ARPA-H — are starting on a new AI venture called Transfyr.

WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump has ordered an investigation into pardons and other executive actions issued by his predecessor, Joe Biden — launching an extraordinary effort to show that the Democrat hid his cognitive decline and was otherwise too mentally impaired to do the job.
Trump, who turns 79 this month, has long questioned the mental acuity and physical stamina of Biden, and is now directing his administration to use governmental investigative powers to try and back up those assertions. Biden, 82, and now undergoing treatment for prostate cancer, dismissed Trump's actions as “ridiculous.”
Here's a look at what Trump is alleging, what impact it could have, and why the country may never have seen anything like this before.
Trump directed his White House counsel and attorney general to begin an investigation into his own allegations that Biden aides hid from the public declining mental acuity in their boss. Trump is also casting doubts on the legitimacy of the Biden White House's use of the autopen to sign pardons and other documents.
It marks a significant escalation in Trump’s targeting of political adversaries, and could lay the groundwork for arguments by leading Republicans in Congress and around the country that a range of Biden’s actions as president were invalid.
“Essentially, whoever used the autopen was the president,” Trump said Thursday.
He then went further, suggesting that rogue elements within the Biden administration might have effectively faked the president's signature and governed without his knowledge — especially when it came to pushing policies that appeased the Democratic Party's far-left wing.
“He didn’t have much of an idea what was going on,” Trump said, though he also acknowledged that he had no evidence to back up those assertions. A Trump fundraising email released a short time later carried the heading, “A robot ran the country?”
Legal experts are skeptical about that the investigation will do much more than fire up Trump's core supporters.
“I think it’s more of a political act than one that will have any legal effect,” said Richard Pildes, a constitutional law scholar at New York University School of Law. He added: “I think it’s designed to continue to fuel a narrative that the administration wants to elevate, but courts are not going to second-guess these sorts of executive actions” undertaken by Biden.
Trump has long questioned the legitimacy of pardons his predecessor issued for his family members and other administration officials just before leaving office on Jan. 20, people whom Biden was worried could be targeted by a Trump-led Justice Department.
But Trump has more recently suggested Biden was unaware of immigration policies during his own administration, and said Thursday that aides to his predecessor pushed social issues like transgender rights in ways Biden might not have agreed with.
It is well-established that a president’s executive orders can easily be repealed by a successor issuing new executive actions — something Trump has done repeatedly since retaking the White House. That lets Trump wipe out Biden administration policies without having to prove any were undertaken without Biden's knowledge — though his predecessor's pardons and judicial appointments can't be so easily erased.
“When it comes to completed legal acts like pardons or appointing judges,” Pildes said, a later president “has no power to overturn those actions.”
Autopens are writing tools that allow a person’s signature to be affixed automatically to documents. The Justice Department, under Democratic and Republican administrations, has recognized the use of an autopen by presidents to sign legislation and issue pardons for decades — and even Trump himself acknowledges using it.
“Autopens to me are used when thousands of letters come in from young people all over the country and you want to get them back,” Trump said Thursday.
Michigan State University law professor Brian Kalt said the “consensus view is that, as long as the president has directed the use of the autopen in that particular instance, it is valid.”
“The only issue would be if someone else directed the use of the autopen without the President’s approval,” Kalt, an expert on pardons, wrote in an email.
Yes. Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution bestows the president with the power “to grant Reprieves and Pardons.”
“A president’s pardons cannot be revoked. If they could, no pardon would ever be final,” American University politics professor Jeffrey Crouch, author of a book on presidential pardons, said in an email. “There is no legal obstacle I am aware of to a president using an autopen on a pardon.”
Kent Greenfield, a Boston College law professor, said, “Once you pardon somebody, you can’t go back and un-pardon them.”
“If it’s done with a president’s authority, I don’t think it matters whether it’s done with an autopen or not,” Greenfield added. “The president’s authority is the president’s authority.”
Trump's suggestions that Biden's administration effectively functioned without his knowledge on key policy matters go beyond questions about pardons and the president using the autopen. Even there, though, the Supreme Court ruled in 2024 that former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution. At the time, Trump celebrated the ruling as a “BIG WIN” because it extended the delay in the Washington criminal case against him on charges he plotted to overturn his 2020 election loss.
Such immunity would likely cover Biden as a former president. It might not extend to Biden administration officials allegedly acting without his knowledge — though Trump himself acknowledged he's not seen evidence of that occurring.
Biden has dismissed Trump's investigation as “nothing more than a mere distraction.”
“Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations. Any suggestion that I didn’t is ridiculous and false,” he said in a statement.
In a word, no.
There have been allegations of presidents being impaired and having their administrations controlled by intermediaries more than the public knew — including Edith Wilson, who effectively managed access to her husband, Democratic President Woodrow Wilson, after his serious stroke in 1919. Wilson's critics grumbled about a shadow presidency controlled by his wife, but the matter was never formally investigated by Congress, nor was it a major source of criticism for Wilson's Republican successor, Warren G. Harding.
More recently, some questioned whether President John F. Kennedy struggled more than was publicly known at the time with Addison’s Disease and debilitating back pains while in office. And there were questions about whether dementia might have affected Ronald Reagan during his second term, before he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 1994, five years after he left office.
Trump himself was indicted four times, and convicted once, while Biden was in office — but those investigations were not ordered by Biden.

A jury in California has awarded more than $3 million in damages to a former Orange County prosecutor who alleged the county's district attorney targeted her and forced her out of her position after she tried to protect women in the office from retalia...
SAN DIEGO -- A jury in California on Thursday awarded more than $3 million in damages to a former Orange County prosecutor who alleged the county's district attorney targeted her and forced her out of her position after she tried to protect women in the office from retaliation for accusing a supervisor of sexual harassment.
The verdict marks the end of a two-week trial in San Diego in which former district attorney supervisor Tracy Miller accused Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer and former Chief Assistant District Attorney Shawn Nelson of a laundry list of misconduct that she said the county did not reasonably respond to, the Orange County Register reported.
“She was thrilled the jury came back and recognized what happened to her,” said Miller’s attorney Bijan Darvish. “But also reliving everything brings back some of the emotional feelings she was feeling at the time.”
The penalties awarded were for the former high-ranking prosecutor's future economic loss and emotional distress.
Miller sued the county, Spitzer and Nelson after she said she was essentially forced to leave her position in 2021. Spitzer and Nelson have denied these claims, while their attorney said Miller was not demoted and didn't lose pay or job duties.
Spitzer said in a statement that he respects the jury’s decision but that when he became district attorney in 2019, he “inherited an office in chaos” and did the best he could given the many overwhelming issues they were facing.
“I am heartbroken over the fact that any of my actions could have been interpreted as anything other than a good faith effort to clean up the public corruption in the Orange County District Attorney’s Office and to create a work ethic that adheres to what Orange County residents demand of its District Attorney,” he said.
Miller accused Spitzer and Nelson of humiliating her, using “gender-based slurs,” disrespecting her and undermining her authority.
She said the situation became especially contentious after she cooperated with the investigator looking into sexual harassment allegations against then-district attorney supervisor Gary Logalbo in 2020. She accused Nelson of speaking badly about the women who spoke out. She also said Spitzer attempted to get one of the women written up for accusing Logalbo, who was the best man at Spitzer’s wedding.
Afterwards, Miller said Spitzer targeted her and criticized her for taking notes during executive meetings, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Spitzer and Nelson have denied these claims.
Logalbo, who died in 2021, was found to have harassed four female attorneys.
The county, Spitzer and Nelson are liable for the $3 million in damages.
Miller was also awarded $25,000 in punitive damages, less than the more than $300,000 requested by her attorney.
Tracey Kennedy, an attorney for the county, Spitzer and Nelson had argued against punitive damages beyond the $3 million, saying the verdict was enough.
“A public verdict sends the message,"" she said in court.
Darvish said in court on Thursday that Miller had long dreamed of being a prosecutor and had had that position taken from her. He also said that she had opened the door for future generations of female prosecutors.
“It wasn’t an accident. It wasn’t negligence. It was intentional,” he said.
When Spitzer became district attorney, federal authorities were investigating allegations that county officials illegally used prisoners to try to get incriminating information from defendants awaiting trial. County authorities have repeatedly denied the existence of such an operation.
Miller, who had been a prosecutor for more than 20 years, was overseeing such important assignments as opioid litigation and the Huntington Beach oil spill, according to Spitzer.",ABC News,['federal authorities'],"['California', '$3 million', 'California', 'more than $3 million', 'Orange County', 'California', 'more than $3 million', 'Orange County', 'San Diego', 'Tracy Miller', 'Orange County', 'Todd Spitzer', 'Shawn Nelson', 'the Orange County Register', 'Miller', 'Bijan Darvish', 'Miller', 'Spitzer', 'Nelson', 'Spitzer', 'Nelson', 'Miller', 'Spitzer', 'the Orange County District', 'Orange County', 'Miller', 'Spitzer', 'Nelson', 'Gary Logalbo', 'Nelson', 'Spitzer', 'Logalbo', 'Miller', 'Spitzer', 'the Los Angeles Times', 'Spitzer', 'Nelson', 'Logalbo', 'Spitzer', 'Nelson', '$3 million', 'Miller', '25,000', 'more than $300,000', 'Tracey Kennedy', 'Spitzer', 'Nelson', '$3 million', 'Darvish', 'Miller', 'Spitzer', 'Miller', 'Huntington Beach']",Sexual Harrassment at Tulane University

Louisiana is poised to adopt new measures that watchdogs warn raise barriers to holding public officials accountable via the state’s ethics board
NEW ORLEANS -- Louisiana is poised to adopt new measures that watchdogs warn raise barriers to holding public officials accountable via the state's ethics board. The legislation was drafted by the personal attorney of Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, who faces charges brought by the board for violating state ethics laws.
Proponents say the measures give those accused of ethics violations more opportunities to respond to allegations, increases transparency and limits abuses of a process they claim is often unjust. But watchdog groups — and the Board of Ethics — warn the changes will undermine the board's ability to hold public officials accountable.
While the changes would not apply to Landry’s current charges, the legislation further bolsters the governor’s power over a state board largely made up of his own appointees. Having overwhelmingly passed in the House and Senate this week — only three lawmakers voted against it — the bill awaits Landry's signature.
Republican Rep. Gerald “Beau” Beaullieu, who sponsored the bill, said it was brought forth after officials complained that the board's investigation process was “more like being investigated by the Gestapo.”
Landry’s office declined to comment.
Another bill would share the names of complainants with officials they are accusing of wrongdoing, as well as limit the board's ability to launch investigations.
Landry’s private attorney, Stephen Gelé, drafted the legislation, which the governor supports.
Gelé is defending Landry against ethics charges brought in 2023 for undisclosed free plane rides to Hawaii when he served as the state's attorney general. Gelé said negotiations are progressing to “amicably resolve the charges.”
Last year, Gelé warned lawmakers that the ethics board’s investigatory powers are “dangerous, unwarranted, and threaten well-established fundamental constitutional rights"" and he has sought to rein them in with new legislation.
The bill's supporters say it gives the board more discretion about whether to pursue investigations and bring charges, cuts down on waste of taxpayer dollars and strengthens due process rights for the accused.
Yet these changes are raising red flags.
In a letter to lawmakers, the Board of Ethics warned that the bill’s requirement to share copies of all subpoenas with officials under investigation allows them to “influence a witness’s documents or responses.”
Critics say the bill undercuts the board's authority by granting local courts the power to quash investigations, gives officials opportunities to run out the clock on the board's one-year timeline to bring charges and prevents the board from investigating violations that were disclosed by public officials seeking the board’s advisory opinion.
The bill also requires a two-thirds board vote to approve an investigation into a sworn complaint and another two-thirds vote on whether to file charges. Current policy requires only majority votes.
Barry Erwin, president of the Council for a Better Louisiana, a nonpartisan government accountability group, said the bill's two-thirds vote requirements constitute a “high bar to overcome” for a board of political appointees.
“I just think in real life, in very political situations, it’s hard for some of these board members to act with the independence in the system we had before,” Erwin said.
The other bill under consideration — which Gelé said he did not craft and Landry has not publicly supported — would require anyone bringing an ethics complaint to disclose their name and file the complaint in person at the ethics board offices in Baton Rouge. The bill passed in the House with only seven lawmakers opposed and is pending final passage in the Senate.
In a legislative committee hearing, David Bordelon, general counsel for the ethics board, warned that the bill would enable officials “to intimidate a witness or potentially alter information that's requested.” Bordelon said the measure would “drastically reduce the number of complaints.""
The legislation's sponsor, Republican Rep. Kellee Hennessey Dickerson, said her bill is part of a fight for “truth” and “justice.”
“For those of us who have been through it, it helps develop peace of mind, knowing who your accuser is, especially when you are spending thousands upon thousands of dollars to try and clear your good name,” said Dickerson, who was fined $1,500 for an ethics violation in 2023.
She argued people frequently file complaints to harass their political opponents. Bordelon countered that the board dispassionately evaluates complaints and provides the accused with the opportunity to defend themselves if charges are brought.
The bill also prevents the ethics board from launching investigations based on non-governmental sources such as media reports.
Following legislation passed last year, the governor directly appoints nine of the board's 15 members, with the Legislature appointing the rest.
Officials with the legislative and executive branches now have more control over those who may be tasked with investigating them, watchdogs note.
“It’s gone from a process that was as much arm's length away from politics as we could make it, and we had it that way for many years, to a process now that is very much more political than we've ever seen it,"" Erwin said. “It’s going to be very difficult for the board to act in a way that guarantees that kind of oversight we want to have.”

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump issued a long-awaited “travel ban” late Wednesday to bar entry of nationals from a dozen countries and partially restrict entry for nationals from a smaller set of countries.
Countries that will have a full ban are Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.
Countries with partial bans are Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.
The proclamation goes into effect Monday.
Wednesday’s proclamation is a modified version of the travel ban from the president’s first term that barred entrance to nationals from predominantly Muslim countries. Federal courts struck down several versions of the travel ban until the Supreme Court upheld it in 2018. Former president Joe Biden repealed the travel ban when he came into office in 2021.
Wednesday’s proclamation allows for some exceptions, including visas that were issued to people from those countries before Wednesday, those who have been granted asylum by the U.S. or have a refugee status and lawful permanent residents.
The president’s proclamation cited national security concerns, but gave little detail on the reasoning that led to selecting the countries.
“Publicly disclosing additional details on which I relied in making these determinations, however, would cause serious damage to the national security of the United States, and many such details are classified,” according to the proclamation.
The Trump administration has moved to end temporary legal status such as humanitarian protections for nationals that hail from some of the countries on the ban list: Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti and Venezuela. Immigration advocates have challenged those moves to end those legal protections in federal courts across the country.

It just happened in one swing state
In a bipartisan move, Nevada's Democratic-controlled Legislature has passed a last-minute bill supported by the Republican governor that will require photo ID to vote in person
LAS VEGAS -- Facing a legislature dominated by Democrats, Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo stood before Nevada lawmakers earlier this year with a message that some did not expect to go far: “Set aside partisan politics.”
It was a plea that might have seemed more aspirational than realistic, given the country's deep polarization. Yet it set the stage for one of the session's most unexpected outcomes — a bipartisan agreement to bring voter ID requirements to the perennial battleground state by next year's midterm elections.
In a deal that came together in the waning days of the session, the Democratic-controlled Legislature approved a bill that combined a requirement for voter ID — a conservative priority across the country and something that has been on Lombardo's legislative wish list — with a Democratic-backed measure to add more drop boxes for mailed ballots in the state's most populous counties.
Lombardo is expected to sign the bill.
The compromise represents a form of bipartisan dealmaking that has been especially scarce in recent years as the country's political divisions have deepened, especially around any potential reform to voting and election laws.
President Donald Trump's lies about his loss in the 2020 presidential election fueled a wave of restrictive voting laws in Republican-led states that Democrats countered with changes to make voting more accessible, while an executive order Trump signed earlier this year seeking to overhaul how elections are run was met with a wave of Democratic lawsuits. Election legislation has mostly hit a dead end in states where the parties share power, making Nevada's bill all the more remarkable.
A requirement for voters to show photo identification at the polls has long been a nonstarter for Nevada Democrats, who have argued that it threatened to disenfranchise low-income voters and make it more difficult for people to vote, especially older voters, those with disabilities and those without driver’s licenses.
Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager, the Democrat who brokered the deal with Lombardo after the governor vetoed his original bill to expand drop box access, acknowledged it was a tough concession. But he said it was the best they could do with the time they had left.
“If you told me at the beginning of the session that we would be passing a voter ID bill, I probably would have told you you’re crazy,” he said in an interview Wednesday. “But I think that highlights the importance of being open and receptive.”
It's a stark contrast to the 2023 legislative session, the last time lawmakers met. Lombardo outlined voter ID as one of his main priorities, but Democrats in the statehouse refused to give the proposal a hearing.
The governor vowed he would take the issue directly to voters.
Last November, Nevada voters overwhelmingly approved the voter ID ballot initiative that Lombardo supported. Voters will have to pass it again in 2026 to amend the state constitution, and the requirement would then be in place for the 2028 presidential election.
Yeager said he was nervous about presenting the bill because he wasn't sure how Democrats would receive it, but told his colleagues over the weekend that voters seemed poised to give their final approval to the measure. He argued that passing a voter ID law now would give the state a two-year head start on implementing the requirements, to get ready before the next presidential contest.
Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar, a Democrat, said he respects the will of the voters and will work with the governor and local election officials “to continue strengthening our elections.” That includes, under the proposal, a new — and free — digital form of voter ID that his office will be in charge of rolling out.
Polls have shown that most Americans support voter ID laws, and that has been consistent over the years and across party lines. A 2024 Gallup poll found 84% of Americans supported requiring all voters to provide photo ID at their voting place to cast a ballot, consistent with Gallup findings from 2022 and 2016. That includes about two-thirds of Democrats, according to the 2024 survey.
“This may not be my favorite policy to have to implement, but I think as a Legislature we have a responsibility to do this,” Yeager told his colleagues.
State Sen. Carrie Ann Buck, a Republican, praised the effort, saying, “I think this is very thoughtful and very courageous of you to bring this in a bipartisan way ... I think our common goals are that every legitimate voter gets to vote.”
But not all Democrats were on board, with five voting against it when it passed the Senate.
“I recognize what you're attempting to do, to stave off something worse,” said Democratic Sen. Dina Neal. But she said she was “wrestling with the philosophical issue with voter ID.”
“I'm not in the space where I am openly willing to disenfranchise a population who may not even understand this law as written.”
If Lombardo signs the bill, Nevada will join 36 other states that either require or request voters show ID when voting in person, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Not all states require photo ID, though. Some accept documents such as a bank statement, and some allow voters without ID to vote after signing an affidavit. A few states allow poll workers to vouch for voters without an ID.
Under Nevada’s bill, voters will be required to show a form of photo ID when voting in person, which will include government-issued IDs and Nevada-issued university student IDs.
“Nevada has some of the most secure and accessible elections in the country,” Yeager said when he introduced the legislation, “and this bill is a set of compromises between the Legislature and the governor that I believe can ensure that tradition continues.”

The government’s findings, which have not been previously reported, were a small victory for 36-year-old Kyleigh Thurman, who ultimately lost part of her reproductive system after being discharged without any help from her hometown emergency room for her dangerous ectopic pregnancy. But a new policy the Trump administration announced on Tuesday has thrown into doubt the federal government’s oversight of hospitals that deny women emergency abortions, even when they are at risk for serious infection, organ loss or severe hemorrhaging. Thurman had hoped the federal government’s investigation, which issued a report in April after concluding its inquiry last year, would send a clear message that ectopic pregnancies must be treated by hospitals in Texas, which has one of the nation’s strictest abortion bans. “I didn’t want anyone else to have to go through this,” Thurman said in an interview with the Associated Press from her Texas home this week. “I put a lot of the responsibility on the state of Texas and policy makers and the legislators that set this chain of events off.” Uncertainty regarding emergency abortion access Women around the country have been denied emergency abortions for their life-threatening pregnancies after states swiftly enacted abortion restrictions in response to a 2022 ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court, which includes three appointees of President Donald Trump. The guidance issued by the Biden administration in 2022 was an effort to preserve access to emergency abortions for extreme cases in which women were experiencing medical emergencies. It directed hospitals — even ones in states with severe restrictions — to provide abortions in those emergency cases. If hospitals did not comply, they would be in violation of a federal law and risk losing some federal funds. On Tuesday, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency responsible for enforcing the law and inspecting hospitals, announced it would revoke the Biden-era guidance around emergency abortions. The law, which requires doctors to provide stabilizing treatment, was one of the few ways that Thurman was able to hold the emergency room accountable after she didn’t receive any help from staff at Ascension Seton Williamson in Round Rock, Texas in February of 2023, a few months after Texas enacted its strict abortion ban. An ectopic pregnancy left untreated Emergency room staff observed that Thurman’s hormone levels had dropped, a pregnancy was not visible in her uterus and a structure was blocking her fallopian tube — all telltale signs of an ectopic pregnancy, when a fetus implants outside of the uterus and has no room to grow. If left untreated, ectopic pregnancies can rupture, causing organ damage, hemorrhage or even death.

She returned three days later, still bleeding, and was given an injected drug intended to end the pregnancy, but it was too late. Days later, she showed up again at the emergency room, bleeding out because the fertilized egg growing on Thurman’s fallopian tube ruptured it. She underwent an emergency surgery that removed part of her reproductive system. CMS launched its investigation of how Ascension Seton Williamson handled Thurman’s case late last year, shortly after she filed a complaint. Investigators concluded the hospital failed to give her a proper medical screening exam, including an evaluation with an OB-GYN. The hospital violated the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, which requires emergency rooms to provide stabilizing treatment to all patients. Thurman was “at risk for deterioration of her health and wellbeing as a result of an untreated medical condition,” the investigation said in its report, which was publicly released last month. Ascension, a vast hospital system that has facilities across multiple states, did not respond to questions about Thurman’s case, saying only that it is “is committed to providing high-quality care to all who seek our services.” Penalties for doctors, hospital staff Doctors and legal experts have warned abortion restrictions like the one Texas enacted have discouraged emergency room staff from aborting dangerous and nonviable pregnancies, even when a woman’s life is imperiled. The stakes are especially high in Texas, where doctors face up to 99 years in prison if convicted of performing an illegal abortion. Lawmakers in the state are weighing a law that would remove criminal penalties for doctors who provide abortions in certain medical emergencies. “We see patients with miscarriages being denied care, bleeding out in parking lots. We see patients with nonviable pregnancies being told to continue those to term,” said Molly Duane, an attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights that represented Thurman. “This is not, maybe, what some people thought abortion bans would look like, but this is the reality.” The Biden administration routinely warned hospitals that they need to provide abortions when a woman’s health was in jeopardy, even suing Idaho over its state law that initially prohibited nearly all abortions, unless a woman’s life was on the line. Questions remain about hospital investigations But CMS’ announcement on Tuesday raises questions about whether such investigations will continue if hospitals do not provide abortions for women in medical emergencies. The agency said it will still enforce the law, “including for identified emergency medical conditions that place the health of a pregnant woman or her unborn child in serious jeopardy.” While states like Texas have clarified that ectopic pregnancies can legally be treated with abortions, the laws do not provide for every complication that might arise during a pregnancy. Several women in Texas have sued the state for its law, which has prevented women from terminating pregnancies in cases where their fetuses had deadly fetal anomalies or they went into labor too early for the fetus to survive. Thurman worries pregnant patients with serious complications still won’t be able to get the help they may need in Texas emergency rooms. “You cannot predict the ways a pregnancy can go,” Thurman said. “It can happen to anyone, still.

A Los Angeles sheriff’s deputy will serve four months in prison on a misdemeanor conviction for using excessive force after the new Trump-appointed U.S. attorney offered an unusual plea deal despite a jury convicting him of a felony
LOS ANGELES -- A Los Angeles sheriff's deputy will serve four months in prison on a misdemeanor conviction for using excessive force after the new Trump-appointed U.S. attorney offered an unusual plea deal despite a jury convicting him of a felony.
The victim's attorney asked a federal appeals court to reinstate the felony conviction, but the court declined to do so on Thursday.
Deputy Trevor Kirk was recorded tackling and pepper-spraying an older woman while she filmed a man being handcuffed outside a supermarket in June 2023. A federal jury in February found Kirk guilty of one felony count of deprivation of rights under color of law, a crime that carries a prison sentence of up to 10 years. Felony convictions also prevent law enforcement officials from continuing to serve or owning a gun.
But when U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli took office a few months later, federal prosecutors offered Kirk a plea deal — a dismissal of the felony if Kirk pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, and a recommendation of one year of probation. A judge agreed to the lessened charge but sentenced Kirk to four months in prison on Monday.
Essayli said in a video posted online that prosecutors also offered Kirk a misdemeanor plea agreement under the prior administration, which he turned down.
“After reviewing this case extensively and thoroughly and carefully reviewing the facts and the law, I made the decision to re-extend the misdemeanor plea agreement to Deputy Kirk,” Essayli said.
In court filings signed off by Essayli, prosecutors wrote they believed that Kirk's actions fell on the lower end of the excessive force spectrum, the woman did not suffer “serious bodily injury,"" and that the case was prosecuted improperly.
Some former prosecutors and police conviction experts called the step highly unusual, especially without any indication of prosecutorial misconduct, ethical violations or new evidence in the case. It follows President Donald Trump's vow to “protect and defend"" law enforcement officers from prosecution and his efforts to assert greater control over the U.S. Justice Department.
“It’s very unusual to offer a plea deal after a conviction,” said Jeffrey Bellin, a former federal prosecutor from Washington, D.C., who is now a law professor at William and Mary Law School. In cases where it could happen, there's usually new evidence of innocence, “not just the same evidence from a different perspective,” he said.
Kirk's attorney, Tom Yu, said they filed a motion for acquittal that was denied but planned to appeal the decision.
Caree Harper, who represents the woman Kirk injured, said in court filings that the federal government changed its account of the incident to make Kirk's actions seem justified.
In the original indictment, prosecutors wrote Kirk “violently” threw the woman to the ground. In the new plea agreement, the government alleged the woman “swatted” at Kirk and “resisted,” Harper wrote, which she said was not proven in the criminal trial nor testified to in civil litigation.
She said her client did not commit a crime, had no weapon, and did not try to flee or resist. She suffered from a black eye, a fractured bone in her right wrist, multiple bruises, scratches and significant chemical burning from the pepper-spray.
Harper said the plea agreement sent a “dangerous message” that law enforcement officials could be convicted of a felony and still “cut a backroom deal after the trial.”
Philip Stinson, a former police officer and attorney who studies police misconduct, said the plea deal offered to Kirk was “seemingly without precedent” in federal court cases prosecuting police officers for their on-duty crimes, according to his search of an internal database of more than 24,000 arrest cases in the last 20 years involving sworn law enforcement officers.
LA County Sheriff's Department spokesperson Nicole Nishida said Kirk will remain employed with the agency but relieved from duty while it conducts an internal investigation to determine if any policy or procedures were violated.
Kirk's case is the latest showing the Trump administration's plan to take a lighter hand in the federal government's traditional role in prosecuting police misconduct. Trump's April executive order on policing promised the “unleashing” of law enforcement and support for their legal defense.
The Justice Department announced in May it was canceling proposed consent decrees reached with Minneapolis and Louisville to implement policing reforms in the wake of the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. The department also announced it would retract its findings in six other sweeping investigations into police departments that the Biden administration had accused of civil rights violations.
Trump-appointed federal judges have also played a hand in dismissing cases against police officers, including murder charges against a former Atlanta police officer who shot and killed an unarmed man hiding in a closet in 2019.
Experts say the reliance on the federal government to perform this policing oversight comes from the close relationship between local prosecutors and police officers, who regularly work together to investigate crimes.
“We are often looking at the federal government to serve as a check and balance for local law enforcement officials who are accused of really egregious activity toward the public,” said Devin Hart, a spokesperson for the National Police Accountability Project.
All four members of the original prosecutors withdrew from the case after the new plea deal was presented, and at least one resigned from the office, according to court filings. Two others took the buyout offered to federal employees, spokesperson Ciaran McEvoy confirmed.",ABC News,"['civil rights', 'executive order', 'oversight', 'executive order']","['Los Angeles', 'Trump', 'U.S.', 'LOS ANGELES', 'Los Angeles', 'Trump', 'U.S.', 'Trevor Kirk', 'Kirk', 'U.S.', 'Bill Essayli', 'Kirk', 'Kirk', 'Kirk', 'Essayli', 'Kirk', 'Kirk', 'Essayli', 'Essayli', 'Kirk', 'Donald Trump', 'the U.S. Justice Department', 'Jeffrey Bellin', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'William', 'Mary Law School', 'Kirk', 'Tom Yu', 'Caree Harper', 'Kirk', 'Kirk', 'Kirk', 'Kirk', 'Harper', 'Philip Stinson', 'Kirk', 'Nicole Nishida', 'Kirk', 'Kirk', 'Trump', 'Trump', 'The Justice Department', 'Minneapolis', 'Louisville', 'George Floyd', 'Breonna Taylor', 'Biden', 'Atlanta', 'Devin Hart', 'the National Police Accountability Project', 'Ciaran McEvoy']",Sexual Harrassment at Tulane University

Trump’s proclamation was the latest attempt by his Republican administration to prevent the nation’s oldest and wealthiest college from enrolling a quarter of its students, who account for much of its research and scholarship. Harvard filed a legal challenge on Thursday, asking for a judge to block Trump’s order and calling it illegal retaliation for Harvard’s rejection of White House demands. Harvard said the president was attempting an end-run around a previous court order. A few hours later, U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs in Boston issued a temporary restraining order against Trump’s proclamation. Harvard, she said, had demonstrated it would sustain “immediate and irreparable injury” before she would have an opportunity to hear from the parties in the lawsuit. Burroughs also extended the temporary hold she placed on the administration’s previous attempt to end Harvard’s enrollment of international students. Last month, the Department of Homeland Security revoked Harvard’s certification to host foreign students and issue paperwork to them for their visas, only to have Burroughs block the action temporarily. Trump’s order this week invoked a different legal authority. If Trump’s measure were to survive this court challenge, it would block thousands of students who are scheduled to go to Harvard’s campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts, for the summer and fall terms. “Harvard’s more than 7,000 F-1 and J-1 visa holders — and their dependents — have become pawns in the government’s escalating campaign of retaliation,” Harvard wrote Thursday in a court filing. While the court case proceeds, Harvard is making contingency plans so students and visiting scholars can continue their work at the university, President Alan Garber said in a message to the campus and alumni. “Each of us is part of a truly global university community,” Garber said Thursday. “We know that the benefits of bringing talented people together from around the world are unique and irreplaceable.” Harvard has attracted a growing number of the brightest minds from around the world, with international enrollment growing from 11% of the student body three decades ago to 26% today.

"After ‘agroterror’ fungus is seized in Detroit, lawmaker says Michigan has best plan to blunt CCP influence",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/after-agro-terror-fungus-caught-detroit-mi-house-says-has-best-national-plan,"Fri, 06 Jun 2025 14:48:26 -0400",Republicans push for the strongest protections nationwide against Chinese influence while Gov. Gretchen Whitmer&apos;s inaction leaves state vulnerable,"EXCLUSIVE: After a dangerous fungus was intercepted in Detroit, Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall spoke out to Fox News Digital about the legislature's efforts to blunt Chinese influence and espionage.
The fungus, Fusarium graminearum, is considered capable of ""agroterrorism"" and was allegedly smuggled into the country by two Chinese nationals studying at the University of Michigan.
Hall, R-Kalamazoo, said he and colleagues have sounded the alarm for months about Beijing’s efforts and that the incident shows Michigan and other states need to be vigilant and prepared.
""As speaker, I led our Foreign Influence Protection package through the State House to block CCP operatives from buying Michigan farmland, infiltrating our universities and accessing our most sensitive data,"" he said.
""Our plan would have tackled this head-on and prevented Chinese government interference with our food supply and our universities.""
He called the bill package the strongest collection of protections against CCP interference nationwide but said it is being held up by Senate Democrats and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.
Requests for comment from Whitmer and Senate President Pro Tempore Jeremy Moss, D-Bloomfield, were not immediately returned.
""Their inaction means our farmland, our military bases and our universities are still at risk,"" Hall lamented while praising President Donald Trump for taking action to protect U.S. land and people from Chinese ""schemes.""
""Too many professors and administrators have let Beijing use our campuses as pawns. We will expose every CCP operation, root out every vulnerability and mobilize every state resource to secure Michigan — farmland, universities and beyond.""
While a Chinese embassy official claimed earlier this week to have no knowledge of the case involving two Chinese students allegedly attempting to bring a fungus to the University of Michigan, experts said the pathogen was capable of causing billions in damage to U.S. grain supplies.
The case drew some parallels to the coronavirus pandemic, which sparked global debate over whether a viral pathogen may have emerged from a lab and infected the world.
A Michigan House Republican Communications Office official said too many federal and state oversight bodies can be infiltrated by CCP sympathizers, and they have allowed foreign agents to run rampant on college campuses with CCP-backed research grants on dangerous things like Fusarium graminearum.
While state officials like Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs have vetoed attempts to block Chinese-linked land purchases, Michigan House leaders have said security breaches like the Fusarium graminearum incident prove the issue cannot go unchecked.

Republicans similarly criticized Whitmer for touting ""corporate subsidy"" deals with Chinese EV battery companies and a proposed Gotion vehicle plant in Big Rapids, Michigan.
In 2024, House Chinese Communist Party Select Committee Chairman John Moolenaar, also a Michigan Republican, said he uncovered ""indisputable evidence"" that Gotion High Tech was connected to supply chains involving forced labor in China.
""The American people expect companies in the U.S. to avoid all involvement with the Chinese Communist Party’s campaign of genocide,"" Moolenaar said.
The company, reportedly tied to both China and German-owned Volkswagen, denied the committee’s findings, calling them ""baseless and absolutely false.""
In October, five Chinese nationals studying in the Great Lakes State in partnership with a Chinese school were charged with espionage for what was an alleged spying operation outside Michigan National Guard Camp Grayling.
A Michigan House source said the package would also block schools from accepting foreign grants if found to be promoting any anti-American agenda and strip foreign data-mining apps from government devices through provisions from Reps. Rachelle Smit, R-Allegan; Nancy Jenkins-Arno, R-Lenawee; and William Bruck, R-Erie.

Is the nutrient taurine really a key to healthy aging?,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/aging/taurine-longevity-supplement-healthy-aging-study-rcna210604,"Fri, 06 Jun 2025 13:38:12 GMT",Scientists have long been trying to discover whether the popular supplement taurine can slow aging. A new study raises questions about the nutrient for longevity.,"Scientists have long been trying to discover whether the popular supplement taurine can slow aging.
Evidence had suggested that levels of the nutrient found in meat and shellfish declined after midlife in people, meaning that taurine might be considered a marker for healthy aging. A 2023 international study confirmed that taurine decreased with age and then showed that taurine supplements could slow the aging process in several species of animals.
Now, a new study published in Science on Thursday found that taurine levels did not decline with age but, rather, were unchanged throughout adult life or even increased in some older people.
The seeming contradiction suggests that taurine measurements wouldn’t be an indicator for longevity and raises questions about its use as an anti-aging supplement. After expecting to find that higher taurine levels in the blood protected against inflammation or some chronic diseases, the finding surprised even the authors of the new study.
“We did this study to confirm what the first had done,” co-author Dr. Luigi Ferrucci, scientific director at National Institute on Aging, said in a press briefing. “Our purpose was really not to find the exact same association, but to find a strengthening.”
When their study was finished, “there was a large discrepancy,” he said. “This discrepancy needs to be analyzed more in depth because that may reveal some important mechanism with aging.”
The new findings do not rule out the possibility that boosting taurine with supplements might improve health in some people.
Vijay Yadav, co-author of the earlier study and head of the Rutgers New Jersey Medical School Healthy Longevity Program, said the new data will be important to the understanding of how taurine affects the aging process because it shows that it matters where the underlying data was collected.
One of the biological databases that was analyzed for his study came from a very homogeneous group of people from Finland, whereas one of the major sources of data for the new study was residents of Baltimore where the population is very varied genetically, he said.
“This would suggest to me that different genetic backgrounds or populations have different taurine values and data from different races or ethnicities cannot be pooled to interpret results,” he said. “It just means we need to better define the variables, genetic background is certainly an important one.” Others could include whether an individual has fasted or recently eaten.
It may turn out to be similar to the situation when scientists were trying to understand the relationship between blood sugar and diabetes, Yadav said. Initially, for example, it wasn’t known that it made a difference if samples were collected from someone who was fasting or had already consumed a meal.
The human body can make small amounts of taurine, although people mostly get it from food. Shellfish, dark chicken and turkey meat contain the highest levels of taurine. Other meats have moderate amounts of taurine. Dairy products have small amounts of the amino acid.
To shed light on whether a taurine supplement improves health and delays biological aging, Yadav and his colleagues are currently running a double blind, randomized placebo controlled trial.
The two papers are a good example of how science can work, said Dr. Peter Abadir, a specialist in geriatrics and an associate professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University. Although the findings are very different, “that doesn’t mean one is right and one is wrong,” he added.
“The message from both these papers is we need more studies,” said Abadir, who was not involved with either.",NBC News,['johns hopkins university'],"['Luigi Ferrucci', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Vijay Yadav', 'the Rutgers New Jersey Medical School Healthy Longevity Program', 'Finland', 'Baltimore', 'Yadav', 'Yadav', 'Peter Abadir', 'Johns Hopkins University', 'n’t', 'Abadir']",

A federal judge has ruled that two federal agencies cannot punish Catholic employers and health care providers if they refuse, for religious reasons, to provide gender-affirming care to transgender patients or won’t provide health insurance coverage fo...
BISMARCK, N.D. -- Two federal agencies cannot punish Catholic employers and health care providers if they refuse for religious reasons to provide gender-affirming care to transgender patients or won't provide health insurance coverage for such care to their workers, a federal judge ruled Thursday.
The ruling from U.S. District Judge Peter Welte, the chief federal judge in North Dakota, bars the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services from enforcing a health care rule it imposed in 2024 under Democratic President Joe Biden. The rule said that existing policies against sex discrimination covered discrimination based on gender identity, so that health care providers risked losing federal funds if they refused to provide gender-affirming care.
Welte also barred the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission from telling employers that a failure to have health plans cover gender-affirming care for their workers would represent discrimination based on sex that could lead to a lawsuit against them and penalties.
The judge rejected a request from an order of nuns, two Catholic homes and the Catholic Benefits Association, which represents employers, to impose similar bans on each agency covering abortion and fertility treatments Catholic organizations consider immoral. He said those claims were “underdeveloped” and not ready for court review.
But he concluded that allowing the two agencies to enforce policies on gender-affirming care or health coverage for it would restrict employers' and health care providers' ability to live out their religious beliefs, violating a 1992 federal law meant to provide broad protections for religious freedoms. The HHS rule had a provision allowing the agency to make case-by-case exceptions based on religious beliefs, but Welte said that would be insufficient.
“The case-by-case exemption procedure leaves religious organizations unable to predict their legal exposure without furthering any compelling antidiscrimination interests,” wrote Welte, who is based in Fargo.
The two agencies did not immediately respond to email messages seeking comment Thursday.
The Catholic Benefits Association serves more than 9,000 employers and about 164,000 employees enrolled in member health plans, according to its website.
The group, founded in 2013, says it “advocates for and litigates in defense of our members’ First Amendment rights to provide employee benefits and a work environment that is consistent with the Catholic faith.” The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects religious freedoms.
Association General Counsel Martin Nussbaum welcomed the ruling, saying the organization’s members “want to do the right thing in their health plan and in their medical services that they provide for those medical providers, and this gives them protection to doing that.”
And he said the judge's ruling suggests there are no mandates from the federal government on abortion or fertility treatments, so there is “no need to provide protection.”
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2020 that the Civil Rights Act's protections against discrimination based on sex also cover anti-LGBTQ+ bias in employment. The landmark 1964 act doesn't have specific provisions dealing with bias based on sexual orientation or gender identity.
But courts also have intervened to limit how far the federal government can go in combating anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination when religious organizations or employers with religious beliefs against LGBTQ+ rights are involved.
Both the HHS rule and the EEOC's policy on sex discrimination have their roots in efforts by President Barack Obama to protect LGBTQ+ rights in 2016, in his last year in office.
When President Donald Trump began his second term in January, he issued an order saying the federal government would not recognize transgender people's gender identities. In April, two employees said the EEOC was classifying all new gender identity-related discrimination cases as its lowest priority, essentially putting them on indefinite hold.
The 2024 HHS rule also covered bias based on ”pregnancy or related conditions,"" and the Catholic health care providers argued that they might face losing federal funds if they refused to perform abortions, in line with Catholic opposition to abortion. But HHS said the rule wouldn't have forced them to perform abortions or provide health coverage for abortions — only that it couldn't refuse to care for someone because they'd had one, according to Welte.

The advocate general for the European Union’s highest court is urging the court to rule that Hungary violated EU law by restricting LGBTQ+ content for minors
BUDAPEST, Hungary -- The advocate general for the European Union’s highest court on Thursday urged the court to rule that Hungary violated the bloc’s laws and fundamental values when it passed legislation barring the availability of LGBTQ+ content to minors under 18.
The non-binding opinion from the European Court of Justice’s Advocate General, Tamara Capeta, states that the legislative changes adopted by Hungary's right-wing populist government violate several rights protected by the EU, “namely the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of sex and sexual orientation, the respect for private and family life, the freedom of expression and information, as well as the right to human dignity.”
Hungary's law, adopted in 2021 by Prime Minister Viktor Orbán's ruling Fidesz party, prohibited the display of content to minors that depicts homosexuality or gender change, while also providing harsher penalties for crimes of pedophilia.
The government has argued its policies, including a more recent law and constitutional amendment that effectively ban the popular Budapest Pride event, seek to protect children from what it calls “sexual propaganda.”
But critics of the legislation have compared it to Russia’s gay propaganda law of 2013, and say it conflates homosexuality with pedophilia as part of a campaign ploy to mobilize Fidesz's conservative voter base.
In her opinion, Capeta rejected Hungary's justification that the measures are aimed at protecting children, since the legislation “prohibits portrayal of ordinary lives of LGBTI people, and is not limited to shielding minors from pornographic content, which was prohibited by the law in Hungary already.”
She also wrote that Hungary has not offered any proof that content which portrays the ordinary lives of LGBTQ+ people has a negative effect on the healthy development of minors.

Linda McMahon says there's been 'progress' from Harvard and Columbia amid Trump's attacks,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/linda-mcmahon-progress-harvard-columbia-trump-attacks-rcna210413,"Fri, 06 Jun 2025 17:38:00 GMT","Education Secretary Linda McMahon on Friday defended President Donald Trump's attacks on elite universities like Harvard and Columbia, while saying that she is seeing ""progress"" from the institutions on the administration's demands.""I have seen progress.","Education Secretary Linda McMahon on Friday defended President Donald Trump's attacks on elite universities like Harvard and Columbia, while saying that she is seeing ""progress"" from the institutions on the administration's demands.
""I have seen progress. And you know why I think we’re seeing progress? Because we are putting these measures in place, and we’re saying we’re putting teeth behind what we’re looking at,"" McMahon said in an interview with NBC News at her office in Washington.
Still, McMahon said Harvard still needs to do more to combat antisemitism on campus and vet international students.
“It’s very important that we are making sure that the students who are coming in and being on these campuses aren’t activists, that they’re not causing these activities,” the education secretary said.
“Students should not come on campus and be afraid to be there and not feel safe to be on campus,"" McMahon added.
The secretary acknowledged that the universities have taken positive steps to combat what she said was growing antisemitism on campus, but credited Trump for pushing them to do so.
""I'm really happy to see what Harvard did, but I wonder if maybe they didn't get a little spur from our action, because they talk a lot about it, but I think we really started to see a lot of their actions once we were taking action,"" McMahon said.
Her comments came after Trump on Wednesday signed a proclamation that aims to deny visas for foreign students seeking to study at Harvard. A federal judge in May blocked Trump from revoking Harvard’s ability to enroll foreign students.
Asked directly whether international students already enrolled at Harvard would have to leave the U.S. due to Trump's proclamation, McMahon demurred, saying, ""Well, that's actually more up to the State Department than it is to Department of Education,"" and reiterating that ""we have to do more careful vetting.""
She echoed comments Trump made Thursday in the Oval Office, when he told reporters that he had no problem with Harvard enrolling foreign students, as long as their names were disclosed to the federal government.
""We want to have foreign students come. We’re very honored by it, but we want to see their list,"" Trump said during a meeting with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.
""Harvard didn’t want to give us the list. They’re going to be giving us the list now. I think they’re starting to behave, actually, if you want to know the truth,"" the president added.
The Trump administration has also accused Harvard and Columbia of fomenting antisemitism on campus, with the federal government in April canceling $2 billion in grants to Harvard and in March canceling $400 million in grants to Columbia. Each grant cancellation came alongside a statement from the Trump administration’s Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism accusing the universities of not doing enough to combat antisemitism on campus.
The cancellation of Harvard’s federal grants came after several members of the Trump administration wrote to Harvard’s leadership with 10 demands that included a requirement to screen admissions of foreign students “to prevent admitting students hostile to the American values and institutions inscribed in the U.S. Constitution and Declaration of Independence, including students supportive of terrorism or anti-Semitism.”
The letter also included demands that Harvard audit their student body, faculty and staff for “viewpoint diversity,” to discontinue all diversity, equity and inclusion programs on campus and to root out what the Trump administration labeled as antisemitism in certain programs and schools on campus.
On Friday, McMahon defended the contents of the letter, saying that ""only 3 percent of [Harvard's] faculty were conservatives.""
""Do you think that's a diversity of viewpoint on campus? Because those — you can't possibly believe that,"" she added. ""And I do think that that's one of the things that Harvard and Columbia and other universities are taking a serious look at, is, what is that balance?""
Asked directly what a diversity of viewpoints would practically look like on campus, McMahon called for ""balancing what the curriculum is going to be.""
""I think Harvard and other universities need to do a better job in that,"" she added.
The Trump administration in recent months has also targeted individual students who it says are advocating for terrorism and antisemitism by participating in pro-Palestinian speech or protests.
In March, the administration drew national outrage after federal authorities arrested Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil, a permanent U.S. resident and graduate student. A federal judge last month ruled that the effort to deport Khalil was likely unconstitutional.
And in early May, Tufts University student Rumeysa Ozturk was freed from ICE custody after she had been detained by federal law enforcement agents in Massachusetts in March.
McMahon on Friday painted the international students facing arrest and detention as “students at Columbia and Harvard en masse attacking other students, yelling hate crimes at those students, making them afraid to walk across their campus, and driving them even underground.”
“I think the American public is looking at that, is saying, ‘I want my kids to go to college and be safe. They shouldn’t have to worry going from class. That’s not why — that is not why I sent them to campus,’” the education secretary added.
McMahon also said that any foreign students arrested for violence or for antisemitism will have the chance to prove whether the detention is “unjust.”
“If there’s a false arrest made, and that person shows that, that that was an unjust [arrest] and that person is released, OK,” she said. “But how many others are not being arrested because we don’t have the proper vetting in place?”
McMahon also spoke favorably about the Trump administration’s decision earlier Friday to ask the Supreme Court to allow it to continue with mass layoff plans at the Department of Education after a federal judge blocked the move. The layoffs were part of a broader Trump plan to dismantle the department.
“The president made it very clear to me, when he asked me to serve in this job, that he believed that I would be successful in my job once the Department of Education was dismantled, and that the agencies, other agencies, would continue the work of the Department of Education. So I have known what that mandate was from the very beginning,” McMahon said.
The Department of Education, in its budget proposal this week, is also seeking to cut its funding to the department’s Office of Civil Rights, which is tasked with investigating claims of discrimination, from $140 million to $91 million. There is currently a backlog of cases.
“We haven’t missed any statutory deadlines and are performing our tasks because we’re operating more efficiently,” McMahon said. “We have streamlined that department.”
This comes as the administration has also targeted efforts to promote diversity, equity and inclusion in the federal government and at elite universities and has targeted transgender students across the country.
On Friday, McMahon defended Trump's efforts to eliminate DEI programs on college campuses, saying that she favored merit-based admissions instead.
""What we found when we admit students through merit and meritocracy and, and their studies, that diversity comes on campuses by itself,"" McMahon said. ""You don't need to have a particular program that says we have to have diversity, equity, inclusion.""
McMahon also said she agreed with the Trump administration's assertion that allowing transgender girls to participate in girls sports was a violation of the federal Title IX anti-discrimination law.
""What the president has said in his executive order [is] men are men and women are women, and so women should participate in women’s sports and men should participate in men’s sports. Otherwise it’s not a level playing field,"" McMahon said, referring to athletes by their sex at birth.
Asked directly whether she though the Trump administration's decision to sue Maine over federal funds was a proportional response to the issue of transgender girls participating in girls' sports, the education secretary simply said, ""To uphold the laws of the United States, we have to take action.""",NBC News,"['civil rights', 'antisemitism', 'federal grants', 'federal grant', 'discrimination', 'education secretary', 'executive order', 'title ix', 'dei', 'federal authorities', 'international students', 'revoking', 'executive order', 'protests', 'columbia university', 'tufts university', 'visa']","['Education', 'Linda McMahon', 'Donald Trump', 'Harvard', 'Columbia', 'McMahon', 'NBC News', 'Washington', 'McMahon', 'Harvard', 'McMahon', 'Trump', 'Harvard', 'McMahon', 'Trump', 'Harvard', 'Trump', 'Harvard', 'Harvard', 'U.S.', 'Trump', 'McMahon', 'the State Department', 'Department of Education', 'Trump', 'the Oval Office', 'Harvard', 'Trump', 'Friedrich Merz', 'Harvard', 'Trump', 'Harvard', 'Columbia', '$2 billion', 'Harvard', '$400 million', 'Columbia', 'Trump', 'Joint Task Force', 'Harvard', 'Trump', 'Harvard', 'the U.S. Constitution and Declaration of Independence', 'Harvard', 'Trump', 'McMahon', 'Harvard', 'Harvard', 'Columbia', 'McMahon', 'Harvard', 'Trump', 'Columbia University', 'Mahmoud Khalil', 'U.S.', 'Tufts University', 'Rumeysa Ozturk', 'Massachusetts', 'McMahon', 'Columbia', 'Harvard', 'McMahon', 'McMahon', 'Trump', 'the Supreme Court', 'the Department of Education', 'Trump', 'the Department of Education', 'the Department of Education', 'McMahon', 'The Department of Education', 'Office of Civil Rights', '$140 million to $91 million', 'McMahon', 'McMahon', 'Trump', 'DEI', 'McMahon', 'McMahon', 'Trump', 'Title IX', 'McMahon', 'Trump', 'Maine', 'the United States']",Threats to Research and Higher Education Funding from Heightened Regulatory Change and Scrutiny; Athletics in Higher Education

The admission came after Israeli media reports quoted defence sources as saying Netanyahu had authorised giving weapons to a clan reportedly led by a man known as Yasser Abu Shabab, a Rafah resident from a Bedouin family, known locally for his involvement in criminal activity. Israel allegedly provided Abu Shabab’s group, which calls itself the “Anti-Terror Service”, with Kalashnikov assault rifles, including weapons seized from Hamas.
“On the advice of security officials, we activated clans in Gaza that oppose Hamas. What’s wrong with that?” Netanyahu said in a short video he posted on social media. “It only saves the lives of Israeli solders, and publicising this only benefits Hamas.”
Strong criticism of the initiative has come from opposition parties in Israel. In a social media post on X, Yair Golan, the leader of the Democrats in the Knesset, said: “Netanyahu is a threat to Israel’s national security. Instead of bringing about a deal … bringing the hostages home and providing security for Israeli citizens, he is creating a new ticking timebomb in Gaza.”
Palestinians in Gaza marked the start of Eid al-Adha, one of Islam’s most important holidays, on Friday with prayers outside destroyed mosques and homes and food supplies dwindling. Food distribution points run by the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation reopened on Friday before closing a few hours later.
Work at the sites was previously halted this week in response to a series of deadly shootings by Israeli soldiers that on Tuesday killed 27 Palestinians and injured hundreds as they were waiting for food. The UN says more than 2,700 children in Gaza are suffering from acute malnutrition.
Israeli jets meanwhile continued to pound the territory and, according to Gaza’s civil defence agency, 38 Palestinians were killed by the Israeli military on Friday, including 11 in a single strike in the north. Israel said four soldiers were killed in combat.
On Thursday, after the allegations on arming Hamas-opposed clans in Gaza circulated in the media, Netanyahu’s office said Israel “was working to defeat Hamas through various means, based on the recommendations of all the heads of the security establishment”.
The former defence minister and opposition lawmaker Avigdor Lieberman alleged that Abu Shabab’s group was affiliated with Islamic State. “The Israeli government is giving weapons to a group of criminals and felons, identified with Islamic State, at the direction of the prime minister,” Lieberman, who heads the opposition Yisrael Beiteinu party, told Kan Bet public radio.
The basis for Lieberman’s allegation of ties to IS was unclear. Abu Shabab’s group has previously been accused of involvement in smuggling operations linked to Egyptian jihadi groups.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Abu Shabab’s involvement with Israeli troops was confirmed last week through several videos circulating on social media in Gaza, showing him operating alongside Israeli soldiers in IDF-controlled areas.
Last week, Abu Shabab’s family issued a statement disowning him, accusing him of collaborating with Israeli forces. “We, like everyone else, were surprised by video footage broadcast by the resistance showing the involvement of Yasser’s groups within a dangerous security framework, reaching the point of operating within undercover units and supporting the Zionist occupation forces, who are brutally killing our people,” the statement said.
“We affirm that we will not accept Yasser’s return to the family. We have no objection to those around him liquidating him immediately, and we tell you that his blood is forfeit.”
On 28 May, Jonathan Whittall, the head of United Nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs in occupied Palestinian territories, said: “The real theft of aid since the beginning of the war has been carried out by criminal gangs, under the watch of Israeli forces, and they were allowed to operate in proximity to the Kerem Shalom crossing point into Gaza.”
When contacted by the Guardian, Whittall confirmed he was “referring to gangs such as Abu Shabab”.
On several posts on Facebook, reported by local media, Abu Shabab denied the allegations of looting, saying he was taking the goods only to feed himself and his family.
Despite nationwide protests demanding a ceasefire deal and the release of Israeli hostages still held in Gaza after Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack, Netanyahu’s coalition remains solid, buoyed up by the steadfast support of far-right parties.
That unity may soon be tested, however, after the ultra-Orthodox Shas party in Netanyahu’s coalition announced it would support dissolving the Knesset.
The Shas party’s decision comes after no significant progress in advancing a law in effect exempting ultra-Orthodox citizens from the military draft.
Israel has mandatory army service but for decades made an exemption for ultra-Orthodox Jews, also known as Haredi, who are allowed to continue full-time Torah study. But an alternative plan seeks to extend the duration of military service for conscripts and raise the age for reservists, while also urging an end to the customary exemptions granted to yeshiva students.
Due to the war in Gaza, the IDF is saying yeshiva students must be drafted, as it urgently needs an additional 10,000 combat soldiers and about 3,000 soldiers for other roles.

Amna Nawaz: In the day's other headlines: President Trump says he had a good conversation today with Russian President Vladimir Putin, but that it would not lead to — quote — ""immediate peace.""Trump posted on social media that they discussed Ukraine's Sunday attack on Russian aircraft and that Putin said Russia needs to respond. New satellite images show Belaya air base in Eastern Siberia before the attack and after with the ashes of what appear to be Russian bombers on the tarmac.Ukraine also released video today from the attack. Officials claim to have destroyed or damaged 41 Russian warplanes. Moscow says those estimates are exaggerated. Today, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy proposed a temporary cease-fire until he and Putin can meet. Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukrainian President (through interpreter): The Russians are not ready for a cease-fire, at least not at the level of the current delegations. They believe this is an issue for the leaders to decide. They told us directly the cease-fire is a matter for a different level. Amna Nawaz: This comes as the Ukraine Contact Defense Group met in Belgium today for the first time without the U.S. secretary of defense. The Pentagon says that scheduling issues prevented Pete Hegseth from attending. The U.S. has played a leading role in the gathering of Ukraine backers. Former Defense Chief Lloyd Austin helped found the group three years ago.Despite his absence from today's gathering, Hegseth will meet with NATO defense ministers in Brussels tomorrow.A federal judge issued an order today to prevent the deportation of Mohamed Sabry Soliman's family. He's the Egyptian man charged in this week's firebomb attack on a Jewish group in Boulder, Colorado. Soliman's wife and five children were taken into federal custody yesterday by U.S. immigration officials. He faces federal hate crime charges and state charges of attempted murder for the attack that injured 15 people.Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said today that the family is being processed for removal proceedings. Soliman's family members have not been charged with any crime.In Gaza, an aid group temporarily paused food deliveries today at its three distribution sites. That's after health officials say dozens of Palestinians were killed this week in multiple shootings near the facilities. The U.S. and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation says there's been no violence at the sites themselves. Israel's military says it fired near people it described as suspects after firing warning shots and they're looking into reports of injuries.In the meantime, hospital officials say Israeli strikes killed more than two dozen people overnight and into today across Gaza. One of the attacks hit a tent in Gaza City, killing two women and a child.Turning now to India, a stampede outside of a cricket stadium in the southern city of Bengaluru today killed at least 11 people and injured more than 30 others. Thousands of fans had gathered to celebrate the winners of the Indian Premier League. Authorities say the crush began when some people who didn't have passes tried to break into the stadium.Footage from the scene showed the injured being rushed off in ambulances as festivities inside the stadium continued. This comes roughly five months after a stampede at a Hindu religious festival in Northern India killed at least 30 people.In Saudi Arabia, Muslims from around the world are taking part in the annual Hajj pilgrimage to mecca amid warnings of excessive heat. People visited the grand mosque today as temperatures soared past 100 degrees. More than 1,300 pilgrims died in high heat last year, prompting changes this time around.Authorities are cautioning people not to go out during the day and children under 12 are banned.

"'Ghost networks' are harming patients, but attempts to eliminate them have fallen short",https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/ghost-networks-health-insurance-companies-therapy-rcna210591,"Thu, 05 Jun 2025 21:40:07 GMT","Insurance companies often refer patients to lists of providers who are unreachable, out of network or don’t accept new patients.","The clock started ticking when Michelle Mazzola’s son, Guy, was diagnosed with autism before his second birthday. Doctors told her the sooner Guy received therapy for his nonverbal communication and behavioral challenges, the better chance he had of reaching his full potential — and perhaps entering a kindergarten with neurotypical students.
Like many parents, Mazzola hoped to find therapists who were covered by their insurance. So she consulted a directory of providers listed as “in-network” on her insurance company’s website.
Mazzola spent two weeks calling providers on the list, but found no viable options.
“Probably 50% of the time no one answered the phone or the phone number was wrong,” she said. “Then you would get people on the phone and they’d say, ‘Yeah, we have about a nine-month wait list.’”
She had stumbled upon what’s informally known as a “ghost network” — a directory of providers that are largely unreachable, out of network or don’t accept new patients. Studies suggest it’s common to encounter these networks while looking for covered care.
By prolonging the search for a provider, ghost networks can delay patients’ ability to get diagnosed and treated, or cause them to forgo care altogether. But regulatory efforts to force insurance companies to update their directories or penalize them for inaccurate provider information have fallen short, prompting some patients to turn to the courts.
A class action lawsuit filed last year on behalf of federal employees in New York against Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield claims the company’s ghost networks amount to deceptive advertising by making people think they’re purchasing insurance with an extensive list of in-network providers.
The suit further claims that inaccurate directories help insurance companies “evade the costs” of covering people’s care. It alleges that plaintiffs who could not rely on Anthem’s directory were forced to use out-of-network doctors, saddling them with thousands of dollars in extra costs. In moving to dismiss the case, Anthem has argued that federal law pre-empts the plaintiffs from suing as members of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.
Mazzola, who lives in Connecticut and runs a construction company with her husband, is not a plaintiff in the suit. She estimated that she pays about $7,000 out of pocket each month for Guy’s care, even after appealing denied claims and getting reimbursed for some out-of-network costs. She believes she wouldn’t have to pay that sum if the providers in Anthem’s directory were available.
“You take it at face value when you’re buying a plan that this is what I’m getting,” Mazzola said. “I would have gladly gone to any of those [in-network] providers if they actually were taking patients.”

A spokesperson for Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield said the company meets access requirements outlined under state law.
“We also work hard to ensure that our provider directories are up-to-date and as accurate as possible, which requires a shared commitment from providers to update their information when there are any changes,” the spokesperson said.
Anthem said its provider network offers most of the services Guy needs, but due to the specialized nature of those services, it can be challenging to get appointments immediately. The company said it reviewed the list of providers that Mazzola tried to contact and found five errors related to incorrect phone numbers or addresses, which it said it will work with providers to fix.
NBC News reached out to 21 providers listed in Anthem’s network, and found 20 either didn’t take patients Guy’s age or had no availability for months.
Another class action lawsuit filed in April on behalf of state and local employees in New York against Carelon Behavioral Health, which provides health care services through insurance plans, claims that ghost networks delayed plaintiffs’ access to mental health treatment. Carelon said it does not comment on pending litigation.
The two class action suits are among the first to challenge insurance companies over ghost networks, said Steve Cohen, a lawyer at Pollock Cohen in New York who is representing the plaintiffs in both cases as well as Mazzola.
“Patients are in need of help,” Cohen said. “They call provider after provider who are listed in this directory to get no answer, to be told it’s not a doctor’s office, to be told they don’t accept the insurance. It’s incredibly frustrating and often complicates getting medical care. It’s dangerous.”
A widespread problem
Mazzola’s experience is familiar to many, regardless of their insurance plan or health issue.
“The vast majority of the time, a doctor’s information is not going to be correct,” said Dr. Neel Butala, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine who co-founded a company that uses artificial intelligence to help large health plans improve provider data.
Butala reviewed physician directories from five large health insurers and found that 81% of entries had inconsistencies, such as address errors or the wrong specialty’s being listed for a physician. His findings were published in JAMA Network Open. A government review of Medicare Advantage plans found that the share of inaccurately listed provider locations ranged from nearly 5% to 93%, depending on the directory.
Ghost networks can pose a particular challenge to finding mental health providers, many of whom have long patient waitlists or have stopped taking insurance. After having called nearly 400 listed numbers for mental health providers in New York, the state attorney general’s office found that 86% were ghost entries. Staffers on the Senate Finance Committee similarly contacted 120 mental health providers listed as in-network by Medicare Advantage plans and found that ghost entries made up more than 80%.
“In my view, it’s a breach of contract for insurance companies to sell their plan for thousands of dollars each month while their product is unusable, unusable due to a ghost network,” Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said at a Senate hearing on mental health access in 2023.
Anneliese Hanson, who was a network market manager at Cigna Behavioral Health until several years ago, said she felt pressure to make provider networks seem more robust to appeal to current or prospective members.
“If our target was to have 100 autism specialists within a certain [geographic area], we would be working towards meeting that target on paper, rather than actually checking and ensuring that there were 100 autism providers,” Hanson said.
A Cigna spokesperson said that it takes rigorous measures to ensure its directory is updated and accurate and that it has a dedicated team of specialists to help patients access behavioral care quickly and conveniently.
In response to Hanson’s comments, the spokesperson said: “These untrue and inflammatory assertions have no basis in reality, neither back then nor today.”
Cohen said federal and state standards require insurance companies to offer an ample number of in-network health care providers within a defined distance of a patient’s home. Those requirements may encourage insurers to pad their directories, he said.
But Butala pushed back on that idea: “I don’t think there’s any actually bad actors,” he said. “I think everyone wants to get this right.”
Butala said there’s an incentive for insurance companies to put out the right information, since a bad member experience could cause them to lose customers.
One explanation for ghost networks, he said, is that providers report doctors’ information in a way that’s conducive for billing, but isn’t necessarily accessible to patients. Insurers often receive data that’s difficult and time-intensive to comb through, he said.
“I think it’s just a really hard problem to solve,” he said.
A better solution?
Mazzola said she and her husband, also named Guy, have been fortunate enough to afford their son’s autism therapy so far. The younger Guy, now 2, is not speaking yet but has gotten better at making eye contact and using sign language to communicate words.
But the Mazzolas still feel the insurance system didn’t work for them as promised.
“You pay for insurance your whole life, hoping [a diagnosis] never happens, but when it does, that you can put your head on the pillow at night knowing they’re going to be there for you. And that just wasn’t the case,” Guy Mazzola said.
Legal and medical experts say some protections against ghost networks exist but aren’t consistently enforced. Under the No Surprises Act, a federal law that took effect in January 2022, private health plans are required to verify and update their provider directories at least every 90 days. If members receive out-of-network care because the directory information was inaccurate, insurance companies must reimburse them for any costs that exceed the in-network price.
Patients can also file complaints to state regulators, who have the authority to fine companies for directory errors. But a ProPublica investigation last year determined that such fines are rare. In an average year, insurance regulators issue fewer than a dozen fines for directory errors, the investigation found — and even then, the penalties are small.
One solution that might reduce the prevalence of ghost networks is a centralized directory of providers that all health plans could refer to. But health policy experts see that as a long-term goal that would be difficult to implement.
Butala said AI can help insurers scrub their directories for errors.
“I don’t think health plans are skimping on throwing people at the problem,” he said. “I think they’ve been throwing too many people at the problem, and now they realize maybe AI can actually make it better.”
But the Mazzolas also think insurance companies should be willing to pay more providers, so it’s not a challenge to offer services in-network.

"Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill” Will Lead to 51,000 Preventable Deaths Each Year",https://truthout.org/articles/trumps-big-beautiful-bill-will-lead-to-51000-preventable-deaths-each-year/,"Wed, 04 Jun 2025 20:01:26 +0000",Annual cuts to Medicaid would average $70 billion — roughly the same amount the wealthy will save in tax cuts.,"In a letter sent to Senate leaders on June 3, a team of health experts at Yale University and the University of Pennsylvania warn that funding cuts included in the budget reconciliation package narrowly passed by House Republicans last month would lead to 51,000 more people dying across the United States each year.
The package, labeled the “big beautiful bill” by President Donald Trump, includes deep cuts to Medicaid, which provides health insurance for lower-income and disabled people. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that a total of 10.9 million people will lose health insurance by 2034 if the current bill becomes law and Congress allows cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act Marketplace to go through. An additional 5.1 million people would lose coverage because the bill fails to extend tax credits for ACA Marketplace plans, and Health and Human Services has proposed new rules limiting the program’s enrollment periods and making other changes, bringing the total to 16 million.
The estimate of 51,000 preventable deaths is based on details from a previous analysis from CBO, which initially found that 13.7 million people would lose their health care coverage by 2034. Since CBO has now revised that estimate to be higher in response to queries from Democrats, the estimate of 51,000 deaths could, in fact, be an undercount.
The legislation would also repeal federal safe staffing standards that require nursing homes and long-term care facilities to maintain a minimum ratio of nurses to patients in order to provide proper care, which the researchers estimate would result in 13,000 additional deaths annually.
The Senate is taking up the “big, beautiful bill” after House Republicans passed the budget package on a razor thin, one-vote margin, despite protests from Democrats and a handful of moderate Republicans from swing districts. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) requested the analysis on mortality as ranking members on the Senate Budget Committee and the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, respectively.
“In other words, when you throw 13.7 million Americans off the health care they have … when you increase the cost of prescription drugs for low-income seniors, and when you make nursing homes throughout America less safe, not only will some of the most vulnerable people throughout our country suffer, but tens of thousands will die,” Sanders said in a statement on Tuesday.
The latest calculations from public health experts adds to a growing pile of research on the devastating potential impacts of budget cuts, which Trump and his fellow Republicans are pushing for to cover tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy. If the current bill becomes law, annual cuts to Medicaid would average over $70 billion over the coming years — the same amount millionaires and billionaires would gain in tax cuts each year, according to the Economic Policy Institute (EPI).
Even with those cuts to critical health care programs, the budget package is projected to increase the national debt by $3.1 trillion over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. In an open letter to the Senate on Monday, EPI and six Nobel laureate economists said the nation’s structural deficits are already too high, and the bill would put upward pressure on inflation and interest rates while reducing incomes for the bottom 40 percent of earners. Taken together, the economists wrote, “the House budget constitutes an extremely large upward redistribution of income” while adding to the national debt.
“These steep cuts to the social safety net are being undertaken to defray the staggering cost of the tax cuts included in the House bill, including the hidden cost of preserving the large corporate income tax cut passed in the 2017 tax law,” the economists wrote. “But even these sharp spending cuts will pay for far less than half of the tax cuts (not even including the cost of maintaining the corporate income tax cuts of the 2017 law).”
The budget reconciliation package makes cuts to health care funding in multiple ways, although the proposal to impose work requirements on adult Medicaid enrollees has received the most media attention. The researchers at Yale and the University of Pennsylvania focused on three policies impacting three distinct groups: individuals who will lose all Medicaid coverage, lower-income seniors who will lose subsidies that help pay for prescription drugs, and people who are expected to die in nursing homes if the safe staffing requirements are removed.
According to their data, the researchers estimated an additional 51,000 preventable deaths annually, including:
- 11,300 deaths from the loss of Medicaid or Affordable Care Act Marketplace coverage, given that CBO first estimated 7.7 million people will lose coverage. That number has since been updated to 10.9 million.
- 18,200 deaths due to the loss of Medicaid coverage among 1.38 million low-income Medicare beneficiaries, causing loss of access to low-income prescription drug subsidies.
- 13,000 deaths among Medicaid enrollees in nursing homes due to the rollback of 2024 nursing home minimum staffing rule.
In addition, the bill does not extend 2021’s enhanced premium tax credits for ACA Marketplace insurance plans. If lawmakers allow these tax credits to expire and the rule changes at the Department of Health and Human Services become effective, an estimated 5.1 million people will lose affordable health insurance, leading to an additional estimated 8,811 preventable deaths, bringing the total to at least 51,000.
“We know that when people are enrolled in Medicaid it saves lives compared to people not having health coverage, and we know the bill will increase churn and disenrollment in Medicaid,” said Rachel Werner, director of the University of Pennsylvania’s Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics and co-author of the analysis, in an interview. “It’s estimated that millions will lose coverage, and that will translate to loss of life.”
Polling consistently shows that cuts to Medicaid and the health care safety net are deeply unpopular, and many rural and lower-income districts in red states depend on Medicaid to keep hospitals and clinics running. Perhaps this explains why Trump has made a show of publicly urging House Republicans not to “touch” Medicaid. Now that Medicaid is indeed on the chopping block, Trump and his allies in Congress are turning to lies and misinformation.
In a statement on Monday, the White House said the idea that “people will literally die” due to Medicaid cuts is a “hoax” and a “disgusting lie” told by Democrats. The bill would penalize states that used their own funds to expand Medicaid to cover some immigrants who would not qualify for federal funding; the White House claimed Medicaid would be “strengthened” by removing 1.4 million undocumented immigrants from the rolls. That coverage loss would also extend to documented children and pregnant women under the proposed policy, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), a top health policy think tank.
Trump and his allies in Congress are also defending controversial Medicaid work requirements included in the House bill, which would require adult recipients to prove that they are working at least 80 hours per month to maintain their health coverage. People with disabilities would also likely be required to prove they qualify for exceptions, and all enrollees would face more paperwork and barriers to coverage. The policy would reduce federal spending by $280 billion over 10 years by kicking people off Medicaid rolls.
The White House said on Monday that “4.8 million able-bodied adults on Medicaid are choosing not to work,” a claim also made by Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, who recently told NBC’s Meet the Press that the 4.8 million people are “refusing” to work and will not lose coverage “if they choose too.”
However, as the Washington Post points out, 4.8 million is the number of people estimated to become uninsured due to work requirements, not the number of young men “sitting around and playing video games” instead of getting a job, as Johnson has previously suggested. KFF analysis shows 92 percent of adults on Medicaid are either working or likely qualify for exceptions to work requirements, as most Medicaid enrollees who do not work are caregivers, parents, students, or have a disability.
Arkansas instituted Medicaid work requirements in 2018, which led to 18,000 adults losing health coverage over the four months before a court stepped in to halt further implementation. A study by Harvard University researchers found the work requirements were effective at cutting Medicaid rolls during that time period but had no effect on employment. Research on other states has found that few programs linked to Medicaid work requirements actually help enrollees find jobs.
Some Republicans have outright lied about the reconciliation bill, suggesting they are not pursuing Medicaid cuts when they are. Others are resorting to callous mockery. When constituents confronted Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa at a recent town hall with questions about people dying without health coverage, she shrugged and told them: “Well, we all are going to die.”
After a video of the exchange went viral, Ernst doubled down with a bizarre video in what appears to be a graveyard, suggesting that those who are afraid of preventable deaths under the Medicaid cuts are like children who believe in the tooth fairy and should embrace “my lord and savior, Jesus Christ.”
“Sen. Ernst’s flippant comments over the weekend reveal a grim reality: Republicans in Congress know that their tax bill will rip away lifesaving health care from their constituents, jeopardizing lives just to pad billionaires’ pockets … and they just don’t care,” said Kobie Christian, a spokesperson for the economic justice campaign Unrig Our Economy, in a statement.
The “big, beautiful bill” will likely undergo changes in the Senate, where conservative fiscal hawks are anxious about increasing the federal deficit, and defenders of public health refuse to blow holes in a safety net that provides coverage for millions of people in order to pay for tax cuts.
“In the wealthiest country in the world, we should be guaranteeing health care to all as a human right, not taking health care away from millions of seniors and working families to pay for tax breaks for billionaires,” Sanders said.

"Risch urges 'top to bottom' USAID spending review after waste, fraud exposed",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/risch-urges-top-bottom-usaid-spending-review-after-waste-fraud-exposed,"Fri, 06 Jun 2025 09:02:27 -0400","Risch said descriptions included in USAID didn’t provide enough information, and must undergo review.","Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, said a thorough review of spending from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is warranted, following the Trump administration’s efforts to overhaul the agency.
USAID was an independent agency to provide impoverished countries aid and offer development assistance, but the agency was upended since February when President Donald Trump installed Secretary of State Marco Rubio to oversee the organization amid concerns that USAID did not advance U.S. core interests. Since then, the agency has faced layoffs and is being absorbed into the State Department.
This increased scrutiny on USAID spending is valid, according to Risch.
""The amount of money that we're spending on that has to be reviewed top to bottom,"" Risch said during an event Wednesday at the Washington-based think tank the Hudson Institute.
‘FIRED ME ILLEGALLY’: EMOTIONAL EX-USAID EMPLOYEES LEAVE BUILDING WITH BELONGINGS AFTER MASS LAYOFFS
Risch said that several weeks into the Trump administration, he and others, including Rubio, evaluated a list of programs that detailed $3 million in funding for ""promotion of democracy in Lower Slobovia."" According to Risch, the description didn’t provide enough information and items like these are totaling up to billions of dollars that must undergo review.
""Lower Slobovia"" is a fictional place and a term used by Americans to describe an underdeveloped foreign country.
""We can do so much better, not only in how, how much money we spend, but how we spend it,"" Risch said. ""So, if you say, well, we're eliminating this program, be careful you don't say, 'Oh, that means we're walking away from human rights.' Look, America is human rights. If America leads the way on human rights. We are the world standard on human rights. We have no intention of giving that position up.""
The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) targeted USAID in its push to eliminate wasteful spending. The agency came under fire for many funding choices, including allocating $1.5 million for a program that sought to ""advance diversity, equity and inclusion in Serbia’s workplaces and business communities"" and a $70,000 program for a ""DEI musical"" in Ireland.
‘HYSTERIA’: WHITE HOUSE SHUTS DOWN CONCERNS OVER USAID DOCUMENT PURGE
As a result, Rubio announced on March 11 that the State Department completed a six-week review and would cancel more than 80% of USAID programs — cutting roughly 5,200 of USAID's 6,200 programs.
Fox News Digital was the first to report later in March that the State Department planned to absorb the remaining operations and programs USAID runs so it would no longer function as an independent agency.
The move means eliminating thousands of staff members in an attempt to enhance the existing, ""life-saving"" foreign assistance programs, according to a State Department memo that Fox News Digital obtained.
NEXT US NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR? HERE'S WHOM TRUMP MIGHT PICK TO REPLACE WALTZ
""Foreign assistance done right can advance our national interests, protect our borders, and strengthen our partnerships with key allies,"" Rubio said in a March statement to Fox News Digital. ""Unfortunately, USAID strayed from its original mission long ago. As a result, the gains were too few and the costs were too high.""

""We are reorienting our foreign assistance programs to align directly with what is best for the United States and our citizens,"" Rubio said. ""We are continuing essential lifesaving programs and making strategic investments that strengthen our partners and our own country.""
Meanwhile, Democrats slammed the restructuring of the agency, labeling the move ""illegal.""
""Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s destruction and dismantling of USAID is not only disastrous foreign policy and counter to our national security interests; it is plainly illegal,"" the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., said in a statement in March.

Big-box stores could help slash emissions and save millions by putting solar panels on roofs. Why aren't more of them doing it?,https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/20/us/solar-power-on-big-box-store-rooftops-climate/index.html,"Sun, 20 Mar 2022 07:01:50 GMT","As the US attempts to wean itself off its heavy reliance on fossil fuels and shift to cleaner energy sources, many experts are eyeing a promising solution: your neighborhood big-box stores and shopping malls.","As the US attempts to wean itself off its heavy reliance on fossil fuels and shift to cleaner energy sources, many experts are eyeing a promising solution: your neighborhood big-box stores and shopping malls.
The rooftops and parking lot space available at retail giants like Walmart, Target and Costco is massive. And these largely empty spaces are being touted as untapped potential for solar power that could help the US reduce its dependency on foreign energy, slash planet-warming emissions and save companies millions of dollars in the process.
At the IKEA store in Baltimore, installing solar panels on the roof and over the store’s parking lot cut the amount of energy it needed to purchase by 84%, slashing its costs by 57% from September to December of 2020, according to the company. (The panels also provide some beneficial shade to keep customers’ cars cool on hot, sunny days.)
As of February 2021, IKEA had 54 solar arrays installed across 90% of its US locations.
Big-box stores and shopping centers have enough roof space to produce half of their annual electricity needs from solar, according to a report from nonprofit Environment America and research firm Frontier Group.
Leveraging the full rooftop solar potential of these superstores would generate enough electricity to power nearly 8 million average homes, the report concluded, and would cut the same amount of planet-warming emissions as pulling 11.3 million gas-powered cars off the road.
The average Walmart store, for example, has 180,000 square feet of rooftop, according to the report. That’s roughly the size of three football fields and enough space to support solar energy that could power the equivalent of 200 homes, the report said.
“Every rooftop in America that isn’t producing solar energy is a rooftop wasted as we work to break our dependence on fossil fuels and the geopolitical conflicts that come with them,” Johanna Neumann, senior director for Environment America’s campaign for 100% Renewable, told CNN. “Now is the time to lean into local renewable energy production, and there’s no better place than the roofs of America’s big-box superstores.”
Advocates involved in clean energy worker-training programs tell CNN that a solar revolution in big-box retail would also be a significant windfall for local communities, spurring economic growth while tackling the climate crisis, which has inflicted disproportionate harm on marginalized communities.
Yet only a fraction of big-box stores in the US have solar on their rooftops or solar canopies in parking lots, the report’s authors told CNN.
CNN reached out to five of the top US retailers — Walmart, Kroger, Home Depot, Costco and Target — to ask: Why not invest in more rooftop solar?
Many renewable energy experts point to solar as a relatively simple solution to cut down on costs and help rein in fossil fuel emissions, but the companies point to several roadblocks — regulations, labor costs and structural integrity of the rooftops themselves — that are preventing more widespread adoption.
The need for these kinds of clean energy initiatives is becoming “unquestionably urgent” as the climate crisis accelerates, said Edwin Cowen, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Cornell University.
“We are behind the eight ball, to put it mildly,” Cowen told CNN. “I would have loved to see policy help incentivize rooftop solar 15 years ago instead of five years ago in the commercial space. There’s still a tremendous amount of work to do.”
What’s the holdup?
Neumann said Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, possesses by far the largest solar potential. Walmart has around 5,000 stores in the US and more than 783 million square feet of rooftop space — an area larger than Manhattan — and more than 8,974 gigawatt hours of annual rooftop solar potential, according to the report.
It’s enough electricity to power more than 842,000 homes, the report said.
Walmart spokesperson Mariel Messier told CNN the company is involved in renewable energy projects around the world, but many of them are not rooftop solar installations. The company has reported having completed on- and off-site wind and solar projects or had others under development with a capacity to produce more than 2.3 gigawatts of renewable energy.
Neumann said Environment America has met with Walmart a few times, urging the retailer to commit to installing solar panels on roofs and in parking lots. The company has said it’s aiming to source 100% of its energy through renewable projects by 2035.
“Of all the retailers in America, Walmart stands to make the biggest impact if they put rooftop solar on all of their stores,” Neumann told CNN. “And for us, this report just underscores just how much of an impact they could make if they make that decision.”
According to Environment America, Walmart had installed almost 194 megawatts of solar capacity on its US facilities as of the end of the 2021 fiscal year and additional capacity in off-site solar farms. The company’s installations in California were expected to provide between 20% to 30% of each location’s electricity needs.
Target ranked No. 1 for on-site solar capacity in 2019, according to industry trade group Solar Energy Industries Association’s most recent report. It currently has 542 locations with rooftop solar — around a quarter of the company’s stores — a Target spokesperson told CNN. Rooftop solar generates enough energy to meet 15% to 40% of Target properties’ energy needs, the spokesperson said.
Richard Galanti, the chief financial officer at Costco, said the company has 121 stores with rooftop solar around the world, 95 of which are in the US.
Walmart, Target and Costco did not share with CNN what their biggest barriers are to adding rooftop or parking lot solar panels to more stores.
Approximate number of households companies could power with rooftop solar
“My suspicion is that they want an even stronger business case for deviating from business-as-usual,” Neumann said. “Historically, all those roofs have done is cover their stores, and rethinking how [they] use their buildings and thinking of them as energy generators, not just protection from rain, requires a small change in their business model.”
Home Depot, which has around 2,300 stores, currently has 75 completed rooftop solar projects, 12 in construction and more than 30 planned for future development, said Craig D’Arcy, the company’s director of energy management. Solar power generates around half of these stores’ energy needs on average, he said.
Aging rooftops at stores are a “huge impediment” to solar installation, D’Arcy added. If a roof needs to be replaced in the next 15 to 20 years or sooner, it doesn’t make financial sense for Home Depot to add solar systems today, he said.
“We have a goal of implementing solar rooftop where the economics are attractive,” D’Arcy told CNN.
CNN also reached out to Kroger, which owns about 2,800 stores across the US. Kristal Howard, a Kroger spokesperson, said the company currently has 15 properties — stores, distribution centers and manufacturing plants — with solar installations. One of the “multiple factors affecting the viability of a solar installation” was the stores’ ability to support a solar installation on the roofs, Howard said.
Cowen, the engineering professor at Cornell, said solar is already attractive, but that labor costs, incentives and the different layers of regulation likely pose some financial challenges in solar installations.
“For them, this means usually hiring a local site firm that can do that installation that also knows local policy,” Cowen said. “It’s just another layer of complexity that I think is beginning to make sense because the costs have come down enough, but it needs kind of reopening that door of getting into an existing building.”
Rep. Sean Casten of Illinois, who co-chairs the power sector task force in the House, said the US has “failed to provide the incentives to people who have the expertise to go in and build these things.” The reason both retail companies and the power sector have not made much progress on solar is because “our system is so disjointed” and has a complex regulation structure, Casten said.
“Why aren’t we doing something that makes economic sense? The answer is this horribly disjointed federal policy where we massively subsidize fossil energy extraction, and we penalize clean energy production,” Casten told CNN. “For a long, long time, if you wanted to build a solar panel on the rooftop of Walmart, your biggest enemy was going to be your local utility because they didn’t want to lose the load.
“We could have done this decades ago,” Casten added. “And had we done it, we would not be in this dire position with the climate, but we’d also have a lot more money in our pocket.”
Acting on climate, equitably
For Charles Callaway, director of organizing at the nonprofit group WE ACT for Environmental Justice, strengthening the rooftop solar capacity in big box retail stores is a no-brainer, especially if companies allow the local community to reap benefits either through installation jobs or sharing the electricity produced later.
Either way, it would put a massive dent in curbing the climate crisis and help usher in an equitable transition away from fossil fuels — and it’s doable, Callaway told CNN.
The New York City resident led a worker training program that helped train more than 100 local community members, mostly people of color, to become solar installers. He also formed a solar workers cooperative to ensure many of the participants of the training program get jobs in a tough market.
In the last two years, Callaway said his group has not only installed solar panels on roofs of affordable housing units, but also equipment capable of producing 2 megawatts of solar energy on shopping malls up in upstate New York. He emphasized that hiring locally would be most beneficial since local installers know the community and local regulations best.
“One of my huge concerns is social equity,” Cowen said. “Access to renewable energy is a fairly privileged position these days, and we’ve got to figure out ways to make that not true.”
Jasmine Graham, WE ACT’s energy justice policy manager, said the potential of building rooftop solar on big box superstores is encouraging, only “if these projects use local labor, if they are paying prevailing wages, and if this solar is being used in a manner such as community solar, which would allow [utility] bill discounts for folks that live in the same utility zone.”
Pressure is mounting for global leaders to act urgently on the climate crisis after a UN report in late February warned the window for action is rapidly closing.
Neumann believes the US can meet its energy demand with renewables. All it takes, she said, is the political will to make that switch, and the inclusion of the local community so no one gets left behind in the transition.
“The sooner we make that transition, the sooner we’ll have cleaner air, the sooner we’ll have a more protected environment and better health and the sooner we’ll have a more livable future for our kids,” Neumann said. “And even if that requires investment, it is an investment worth making.”

(AP) — A Massachusetts high school student who was arrested by immigration agents on his way to volleyball practice has been released from custody after a judge granted him bond Thursday. Marcelo Gomes da Silva, 18, who came to the U.S. from Brazil at age 7, was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents Saturday. Authorities have said the agents were looking for the Milford High School teenager’s father, who owns the car Gomes da Silva was driving at the time and had parked in a friend’s driveway. “It shouldn’t have happened in the first place. This is all a waste,” his lawyer, Robin Nice, told reporters after a hearing in Chelmsford. Gomes da Silva, who was expected to be released Thursday afternoon on $2,000 bond, appeared via video from elsewhere in Massachusetts.

We just disrupted a community’s life,” Nice said. “These kids should be celebrating graduation and prom, I assume? They should be doing kid stuff, and it is a travesty and a waste of our judicial process to have to go through this.” She said Gomes da Silva slept on the cement floor of a room holding 25 to 35 men, many twice his age, most of the time he was detained, with no windows, no time outside and no permission to shower. He was able to brush his teeth twice. Nice said that at one point Gomes da Silva asked for a Bible and was denied. He went to the hospital Wednesday because he had concerns about a concussion he received before he was detained and was suffering from a bad cold, Nice said.

Not ICE’s target, but detained anyway U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said earlier this week that ICE officers were targeting a “known public safety threat” and that Gomes da Silva’s father “has a habit of reckless driving at speeds in excess of 100 miles per hour through residential areas.” “While ICE officers never intended to apprehend Gomes da Silva, he was found to be in the United States illegally and subject to removal proceedings, so officers made the arrest,” she said in a statement. Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said Monday that “like any local law enforcement officer, if you encounter someone that has a warrant or … he’s here illegally, we will take action on it.” Gomes da Silva initially entered the country on a visitor visa and was later issued a student visa that has since lapsed, Nice said. She described him as deeply rooted in his community and a dedicated member of both the school marching band and a band at his church. The immigration judge set a placeholder hearing date for a couple of weeks from Thursday, but it might take place months from that, Nice said. “We’re optimistic that he’ll have a future in the United States,” she said. A federal judge considering Gomes da Silva’s request to be released while his immigration case proceeds has given the government until June 16 to respond and ordered that Gomes da Silva not be moved out of Massachusetts without 48 hours’ notice given to the court. The government sought permission Wednesday to move Gomes da Silva to a detention facility in a different New England state, Nice said. A judge quickly denied the request. A shaken community “I love my son. We need Marcelo back home. It’s no family without him,” João Paulo Gomes Pereira said in a video released Wednesday. “We love America. Please, bring my son back.” The video showed the family in the teen’s bedroom. Gomes da Silva’s sister describes watching movies with her brother and enjoying food he cooks for her: “I miss everything about him.” Students at Milford High staged a walkout Monday to protest his detainment. Other supporters wore white and packed the stands of the high school gymnasium Tuesday night, when the volleyball team dedicated a match to their missing teammate. Hanna Ghannan, who graduated from the school the day after Gomes de Silva was detained, was among those cheering outside the courthouse as the news came that her classmate would be let out on bond. “I’m just happy that everyone’s coming to together as a community because there is a lot of hate — and I mean a lot of hate,” she said. Amani Jack, also a recent Milford High graduate, said her classmate’s absence loomed large over the graduation ceremony, where he was supposed to play in the band. She said if she had a chance to speak with the president, she’d ask him to ‘just put yourself in our shoes.’ “He did say he was going to deport criminals,” she said. “Marcelo is not a criminal. He’s a student. I really want him to take a step in our shoes, witnessing this. Try and understand how we feel. We’re just trying to graduate high school.” Veronica Hernandez, a family advocate from Medford who said she works in a largely Hispanic community where ICE has had an active presence, said cases like Gomes da Silva’s show immigration enforcement is serious about taking “anybody” without legal status, not just those accused of crimes. “I think seeing that something so simple as a child driving themselves and their friends to volleyball practice at risk struck a chord,” she said.

Many LGBTQ+ travelers have expressed concerns about or decided to skip the World Pride gathering going on in Washington due to anxieties about safety, border policies and a hostile political climate
WASHINGTON -- Days before she was to deliver opening remarks to World Pride’s human rights conference in Washington, Phyll Opoku-Gyimah, the co-founder of UK Black Pride, said she was denied entry to the United States after her visa was revoked due to her travels to Cuba earlier this year.
Opoku-Gyimah, widely known as Lady Phyll, said she applied immediately for a nonimmigrant visa. The earliest date she was given: September.
“I’ve called. I’ve written. I’ve pleaded,” she said over a video livestream. “And the answer was a cold, bureaucratic ‘No.’”
Many LGBTQ+ travelers have expressed concerns or decided to skip World Pride due to anxieties about safety, border policies and a hostile political climate. Yet cross-national strategizing has still been central to the gathering as international attendees echoed that they wanted to send a clear message of opposition to U.S. officials with their presence.
“This is World Pride on Trump’s doorstep,"" said Yasmin Benoit, a British model and asexual activist. ""And that’s all the more reason to be here. We want to show the U.S. that there’s a lot of eyes on what’s happening here.”
World Pride gathers LGBTQ+ advocates from around the globe and has taken place most recently in Australia, Sweden and Denmark. This year, which marks the 50th anniversary of Washington's Pride festival, is the first time the city is hosting the gathering. Yet for many, the global celebration has been complicated by President Donald Trump's policies targeting transgender people and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.
Trump, a Republican, has said that whether a person is a man or woman is determined by that person's biological characteristics at birth, and about two-thirds of U.S. adults agree with him, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll. He has denounced DEI policies as a form of discrimination that threatens merit-based decision-making.
Several countries, including Denmark, Finland and Germany, issued cautions for LGBTQ+ travelers visiting the U.S. for World Pride, culminates in a closing festival this weekend with a parade, a rally and concerts. Capital Pride Alliance, which organized World Pride D.C., included an advisory for transgender and nonbinary international travelers alongside security protocols.
Egale Canada, one of the country’s largest LGBTQ+ advocacy organizations, announced in February that its members would not attend any events in the U.S. through June, including World Pride. It cited concerns for transgender and nonbinary staff members.
“I didn't feel it was safe to have our staff crossing into the U.S. with the current hostilities, through legislation and rhetoric,” said Helen Kennedy, the organization’s executive director.
The African Human Rights Coalition, meanwhile, called for a boycott of World Pride in Washington “because the event is being held in a venue ... governed now by an antagonistic fascist regime which presents distinct dangers to foreign LGBTQI+ attendees,” the organization said in a statement.
Jessica Stern, a former U.S. special envoy for the human rights of LGBTQI+ people, acknowledged that many potential attendees decided to skip World Pride as they “wonder if they’ll be safe in U.S. airports and on our streets.”
“Thank you for coming to the U.S. amid a time of great uncertainty,” she said in her opening remarks before an emcee later instructed attendees to shout out where they had traveled from. Answers included New Zealand, Sweden, England, Zimbabwe, Australia, Nigeria and India.
As an increasing number of international travelers have expressed anxiety, John Tanzella, president of the International LGBTQ+ Travel Association, said he has assured people that Washington is an inclusive city but advised them to stay informed of local policies, connect with LGBTQ+ organizations on the ground and book with trusted businesses with track records of inclusion. The organization is working on guidance for transgender and nonbinary travelers in the U.S. for the World Pride parade and march.
“Safety always comes up, especially in the current climate, but there’s also a deep desire to bring our community together,” he said. “For many, World Pride in Washington, D.C., feels extra meaningful given its location. There’s caution, yes, but above all, people want to show up, be seen and be heard.”
Benoit's friends had warned her not to travel to the U.S., and her anxiety was mounting in the days leading up to her flight. She planned to avoid telling customs agents she was traveling for World Pride. But when that information surfaced, she said agents took her passport and asked her questions for an additional hour about where she was staying and for how long.
Still, she said, it is more important now than ever to “send a message to Trump in his own backyard"" and to embrace the global nature of World Pride.
“The ability to bring people together to understand how interconnected everything is, how this harmful rhetoric may bleed over to other countries, is really important,"" she said. “And it’s an opportunity to access resources and people you may not have access to back home.”
Essy Adhiambo, executive director of the Initiative for Equality and Non Discrimination, deleted all the social media apps on her phone before her 35-hour journey from Mombasa, Kenya, worrying that her phone might be searched. Still, Adhiambo said being visible as an international LGBTQ+ community is powerful amid threats to the community across the globe.
“We must continue to protest in the current context we are in,"" she said. ""Those of us who are able to make this journey have to hold space for those who could not, especially our trans siblings. We want to amplify our message on the land of the people who are supporting homophobia.”
Nikki Phinyapincha, co-founder of Trans Pride Thailand, set off on a 25-hour journey to World Pride from Thailand after issuing a travel advisory from her organization for Thai LGBTQ+ people.
“The political climate and instability is not new, but it makes it more important that we are here,"" she said. ""We need to keep doing this work, strategizing together and being adaptive.”
For people from marginalized communities, Opoku-Gyimah said, “just traveling to speak truth can often feel like a mountain.”
“We have to prove our worth at every border, every checkpoint,” she said.
Yet Opoku-Gyimah applauded the international nature of World Pride amid ""connected, coordinated ... and increasingly violent"" attacks against LGBTQ+ communities across the globe. She said the U.S. government’s rolling back of DEI initiatives, protections for the transgender community and reproductive rights have had ripple effects abroad, including in the U.K.

Mary Miller, an Illinois representative, on Friday published – then deleted – a post on X saying that Giani Singh, a Sikh Granthi from southern New Jersey, should not have delivered the House’s morning prayer.
Miller at first mistakenly identified Singh as a Muslim and said that it was “deeply troubling” someone of that faith had been allowed to lead prayer in the House and it “should never have been allowed”, Miller posted on X.
“America was founded as a Christian nation, and I believe our government should reflect that truth, not drift further from it,” Miller continued. “May God have mercy.”
Miller first edited her post to change Muslim to Sikh – then opted to delete it.
Her comments triggered swift outrage, with the Democratic House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, saying: “It’s deeply troubling that such an ignorant and hateful extremist is serving in the United States Congress. That would be you, Mary.”
Similarly, David Valadao, a Republican congressman of California, said on Friday: “I’m troubled by my colleague’s remarks about this morning’s Sikh prayer, which have since been deleted. Throughout the country – and in the Central Valley – Sikh-Americans are valued and respected members of our communities, yet they continue to face harassment and discrimination.”
Jared Huffman, another Democratic US House member from California, wrote on X: “I often say that I serve in Congress with some of the greatest minds of the 18th century. With [representative] Miller I may need to take it back a few more centuries.”
Meanwhile, the Democratic congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman of New Jersey said on X: “It’s deeply troubling that someone with such contempt for religious freedom is allowed to serve in this body. This should have never been allowed to happen. America was founded as free nation, and I believe the conduct of its legislators should reflect that truth, not drift further from it.”
Grace Meng, a Democratic congresswoman from New York, also weighed in on Miller’s tweets, saying: “What’s deeply disturbing is the blatant ignorance and anti-Sikh, anti-Muslim xenophobia coming from my colleague across the aisle. There is no place in our country, and especially the halls of Congress, for this hate and intolerance.”
Meng went on to add: “The tweet may have been deleted, but we still have the receipts.”
The Congressional Asian Pacific American caucus (Capac) also condemned Miller, saying she had engaged in “anti-Sikh and anti-Muslim bigotry”.
“Sikhs and Muslims practice two separate and distinct religions, and conflating the two based on how someone looks is not only ignorant, but also racist,” Capac said in a statement.
The Sikh Coalition also responded on X, saying: “To be clear, deleting the tweet is not enough. Congresswoman Miller should apologize for her remarks – to both the Sikh and Muslim communities, because no one should be targeted on the basis of their identity.”
Similarly, the Hindu American Foundation said: “Whichever version of the tweet [Miller] was going with, it is racist, xenophobic and plainly un-American to lash out over a Sikh prayer. When you took your oath of office [congresswoman] Miller, you swore to uphold our constitution, whose first amendment prohibits your establishing an official religion or favoring one religion over another.”

Todd Young (Ind.) and Ted Cruz (Texas) are leading Republican efforts to brand June as “Life Month” during the already celebrated Pride Month, which honors the achievements and culture of the LGBTQ+ community.
“Every human life is worthy of protection, and it is especially incumbent upon Americans and lawmakers to protect the most vulnerable among us,” Cruz said in a statement on X, formerly Twitter.
According to Young’s statement introducing the resolution, “Life Month” is meant to “recognize the dignity of human life, commends those who promote life, and encourages policymakers to continue providing resources to empower women and families to choose life.”
While the senators did have 11 other months they could designate as “Life Month,” they said the resolution marks June as the anniversary of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade in June 2022.
Cruz and Young’s pitch rings similar to Illinois Congresswoman Mary Miller’s resolution, which suggested fully replacing “Pride Month” with “Family Month.”
“By recognizing June as Family Month, we reject the lie of ‘Pride’ and instead honor God’s timeless and perfect design,” Miller told right-wing news site The Daily Wire.
Neither Cruz nor Young said they want to replace Pride Month, but their actions come at a time where the Trump administration has launched aggressive attacks against the LGBTQ+ community.
Under his administration, President Donald Trump has erased or altered Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pages focused on the risks of suicide among LGBTQ children, school safety and health disparities. He has also signed executive orders that declared it official U.S. policy that there are only two sexes, male and female, and banned people with gender dysphoria from military service.
Earlier this week, Trump’s Department of Education also formally declared June as “Title IX Month.” On Tuesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the Navy to rename the USNS Harvey Milk, which honors the slain LGBTQ+ rights icon. This move reportedly was intentionally made during Pride Month.
A total of 26 Republican senators co-sponsored the resolution, including Alabama’s Tommy Tuberville and South Carolina’s Lindsey Graham.
“If we are going to dedicate entire months to recognizing every group under the sun, the least we can do is dedicate June to protecting unborn babies,” Tuberville said on X.",Huffington Post,"['executive order', 'title ix', 'executive order']","['Todd Young', 'Ind.', 'Ted Cruz', 'Texas', 'Cruz', 'Twitter', 'Young', 'the Supreme Court', 'Roe v.

Seven times federal judges ruled against the Trump admin this week,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/7-times-federal-judges-ruled-against-trump-admin-week,"Fri, 06 Jun 2025 08:01:38 -0400",The Trump administration continues to face pushback from federal judges who have issued rulings against its actions in a number of cases this week.,"Federal judges are continuing their pushback against the Trump administration by issuing orders blocking a number of actions, including the deportation of the family of Mohamed Soliman, who is facing a hate crime charge in the wake of a firebombing attack in Colorado.
The rulings – some from judges appointed under the Biden administration – come after White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said last week that ""President Trump had more injunctions in one full month of office in February than Joe Biden had in three years.""
""The real constitutional crisis is taking place within our judicial branch, where district court judges in liberal districts across the country are abusing their power to unilaterally block President Trump's basic executive authority,"" Leavitt also has said.
Here are seven cases in which federal judges ruled against the Trump administration this week:
1. Deportation of Boulder attack suspect’s family is blocked, despite visa violations
A Biden administration-appointed federal judge in Colorado on Wednesday halted the deportation of the wife and five children of Mohamed Soliman, the Egyptian national under federal investigation for the Boulder firebombing attack on Sunday.
The temporary restraining order issued by U.S. District Judge Gordon P. Gallagher prevents federal immigration authorities from removing Soliman's wife, Hayem El Gamal, and the couple's five children from the country, at least for now.
TRUMP FOE JUDGE BOASBERG RULES DEPORTED MIGRANTS CAN CHALLENGE REMOVALS, IN BLOW TO ADMINISTRATION
The ruling will remain in effect until a scheduled hearing on June 13. It came after El Gamal's friend, Susanna Dvortsin, sought emergency legal protection for the family and argued that they faced imminent deportation by the Trump administration without the opportunity to present their case in court.
According to Fox News correspondent Bill Melugin, citing sources, El Gamal and her five children have all overstayed their visas. However, an asylum application had already been submitted on their behalf by Soliman.
2. Judge rules against Trump administration twice in Abrego Garcia case
A federal judge granted a request Wednesday from more than a dozen major news outlets and publishers to unseal certain records in the case of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, the Salvadorian migrant and alleged MS-13 member who was deported from Maryland to El Salvador in March in what administration officials have acknowledged was an administrative error.
Separately on Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis granted a request from Abrego Garcia's legal team to file a motion for sanctions against the Trump administration.
The one-two punch from Xinis could give plaintiffs new ammunition to pursue more formal punishments against the Trump administration if officials are found to have been acting in bad faith or knowingly defying court orders. The Supreme Court has ordered the Trump administration to ""facilitate"" Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S.
3. Effort to pull funding from local governments is slapped with a preliminary injunction
A federal judge in Washington state on Tuesday granted Denver and other local governments a preliminary injunction against the Trump administration’s threats to withhold federal funding for transportation programs.
Denver and dozens of other plaintiffs filed the lawsuit in May, claiming that the Trump administration’s threats to withhold an estimated $4 billion in critical federal grants exceed the Executive Branch’s authority and were thereby ""unlawful and politically motivated funding conditions,"" according to the injunction order.
The judge ruled that the Trump administration likely violated the Separation of Powers doctrine, and that its threats to cut funding constitute harm.
4. Trump administration ordered to restore funding to Clinton-era agency that gutted by DOGE
A federal judge on Thursday ordered the Trump administration to restore millions of dollars in grant funding for AmeriCorps and to reemploy thousands of employees, ruling that the administration's abrupt dismantling of the organization violated federal law.
U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman agreed to reinstate thousands of terminated AmeriCorps employees across 24 U.S. states and D.C., which sued the administration earlier this year over the steep cuts to the agency ordered by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.
FEDERAL JUDGE RULES AGAINST TRUMP ORDER HALTING SEX CHANGE PROCEDURES IN PRISONS
She also ordered the Trump administration to restore hundreds of millions of dollars in congressionally approved funding for AmeriCorps programs, which were also slashed by DOGE earlier this year.
5. Judge halts Trump administration's moves to close Job Corps centers across nation
A federal judge on Wednesday issued a temporary restraining order that stops the Trump administration from closing Job Corps centers.
The motion, filed by the National Job Corps Association, was to stop the Department of Labor's closure of 99 Job Corps campuses nationwide, according to a news release.
Job Corps was created by Congress in 1964 and allows 16- to 24-year-olds from disadvantaged backgrounds to obtain high school diplomas or an equivalent, vocational certificates and licenses, and on-the-job training. The program currently serves about 25,000 people at 120 Job Corps centers run by contractors.
When the Department of Labor announced it was pausing Job Corps center operations, it said the program was not cost-effective, had a low graduation rate and was not placing participants in stable jobs. The department also said there had been thousands of instances of violence, drug use and security breaches at Job Corps centers.
6. Judge tells ICE not to remove trans migrant seeking asylum from Washington detention facility
A federal judge in Oregon on Tuesday issued an order barring U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement from removing a Mexican asylum seeker from a Washington detention facility, according to local reports.
The migrant, a 24-year-old transgender woman identified as ""O-J-M"" in court documents, was arrested outside a Portland courtroom on Monday and transferred to the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma, Washington.
U.S. District Court Judge Amy Baggio, a President Joe Biden appointee, also demanded that ICE provide the exact date and time of the removal from Portland and explain why it was deemed immediately necessary.
7. ICE is prevented from detaining Columbia University student
A federal judge on Thursday issued a fresh order blocking ICE from arresting Yunseo Chung, a 21-year-old Columbia University student whom the Trump administration is seeking to deport back to South Korea after she participated in an anti-Israel protest earlier this year, according to the Washington Post.
The newspaper reported that federal agents first sought to detain Chung in March, yet were unable to locate her. She then sued to block them from doing so.

""This is a win not just for Yunseo and for the legions of people who stand up for Palestinians and oppose the daily atrocities in Gaza that our government underwrites, but also for freedom of speech and the rule of law in our country,"" Ramzi Kassem, co-director of CLEAR, a legal nonprofit at City University of New York that is representing Chung, told the Washington Post.

Ukraine’s Operation Spider Web destroyed more than aircraft – it tore apart the old idea that bases far behind the front lines are safe,https://www.yahoo.com/news/ukraine-operation-spider-destroyed-more-125227990.html,2025-06-05T12:52:27Z,,"Ukraine’s Operation Spider Web destroyed more than aircraft – it tore apart the old idea that bases far behind the front lines are safe
A series of blasts at airbases deep inside Russia on June 1, 2025, came as a rude awakening to Moscow’s military strategists. The Ukrainian strike at the heart Russia’s strategic bombing capability could also upend the traditional rules of war: It provides smaller military a blueprint for countering a larger nation’s ability to launch airstrikes from deep behind the front lines.
Ukraine’s Operation Spider Web involved 117 remote-controlled drones that were smuggled into Russia over an 18-month period and launched toward parked aircraft by operators miles away.
The raid destroyed or degraded more than 40 Tu-95, Tu-160 and Tu-22 M3 strategic bombers, as well as an A-50 airborne-early-warning jet, according to officials in Kyiv. That would represent roughly one-third of Russia’s long-range strike fleet and about US$7 billion in hardware. Even if satellite imagery ultimately pares back those numbers, the scale of the damage is hard to miss.
The logic behind the strike is even harder to ignore.
Traditional modern military campaigns revolve around depth. Warring nations try to build combat power in relatively safe “rear areas” — logistics hubs that are often hundreds if not thousands of miles from the front line. These are the places where new military units form and long-range bombers, like those destroyed in Ukraine’s June 1 operation, reside.
Since the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the Kremlin has leaned heavily on its deep-rear bomber bases — some over 2,000 miles from the front in Ukraine. It has paired this tactic with launching waves of Iranian-designed Shahed attack drones to keep Ukrainian cities under nightly threat.
The Russian theory of victory is brutally simple: coercive airpower. If missiles and one-way drones fall on Kyiv often enough, civilian morale in Ukraine will crack, even as the advance of Russian ground forces get bogged down on the front line.
For Kyiv’s military planners, destroying launch platforms undercuts that theory far more cheaply than the only other alternative: intercepting every cruise missile in flight, which to date has achieved an 80% success rate but relies heavily on Western-donated equipment coming increasingly in short supply.
Airfield vulnerability
Airfields have always been critical targets in modern warfare, the logic being that grounded bombers and fighters are more vulnerable and easier to hit.
In the North African desert during World War II, the United Kingdom’s Special Air Service used jeep raids and delayed-action explosives to knock out an estimated 367 enemy aircraft spread across North Africa — firepower the Luftwaffe never regenerated. That same year, German paratroopers seized the airstrips on Crete, denying the British Royal Air Force a forward base and tipping an entire island campaign.
A generation later in Vietnam, Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army assault teams armed with satchel charges and mortars repeatedly penetrated U.S. perimeters at Phan Rang, Da Nang and Bien Hoa, burning fighters on the ramp and forcing the diversion of thousands of American soldiers to base security.
The underlying playbook of hitting aircraft on the ground remains effective because it imposes cascading costs. Every runway cratered and every bomber torched obliges the military hit to pour money into ways to frustrate such attacks, be it hardened shelters or the dispersal of squadrons across multiple bases. Such air attacks also divert fighters from the front lines to serve as guards.
A new age of drone warfare
In Operation Spider Web, Ukraine has sought to repeat that strategy while also leveraging surprise to achieve psychological shock and dislocation.
But the Ukraine operation taps into a uniquely 21st-century aspect of warfare.
The advent of unmanned drone warfare has increasingly seen military practitioners talk of “air littorals” — military speak for the slice of atmosphere that sits above ground forces yet below the altitude where high-performance fighters and bombers traditionally roam.
Drones thrive in this region, where they bypass most infantry weapons and fly too low for traditional radar-guided defenses to track reliably, despite being able to incapacitate targets like fuel trucks or strategic bombers.
By smuggling small launch teams of drones within a few miles of each runway, Kyiv created pop-up launchpads deep into Russia and were able to catch the enemy off guard and unprepared.
The economic benefits of Ukraine’s approach are stark. Whereas a drone, a lithium-battery and a warhead cost well under $3,000, a Russian Tu-160 bomber costs in the region of $250 million.
The impact on Russia
Ukraine’s Operation Spider Web will have immediate and costly consequences for Russia, even if the strikes end up being less destructive than Kyiv currently claims.
Surviving bombers will need to be relocated. Protecting bases from repeat attacks will mean erecting earthen revetments, installing radar-guided 30 mm cannons and electronic-warfare jammers to cover possible attack vectors. This all costs money. Even more importantly, the operation will divert trained soldiers and technicians who might otherwise rotate to the front line in support of the coming summer offensive.
The raid also punches a hole in Russia’s nuclear weapons capabilities.
Losing as many as a dozen Tu-95 and Tu-160 aircraft, which double as nuclear-capable bombers, would be strategically embarrassing and may prod the Kremlin to rethink the frequency of long-range air patrols.
Beyond the physical and financial damage to Russia’s fleet, Ukraine’s operation also comes with a potent psychological effect. It signals that Ukraine, more than three years into a war aimed at grinding down morale, is able to launch sophisticated operations deep into Russian territory.
Ukraine’s security service operation unfolded in patient, granular steps: 18 months of smuggling disassembled drones and batteries across borders inside innocuous cargo, weeks of quietly reassembling kits, and meticulous scouting of camera angles to ensure that launch trucks would be indistinguishable from normal warehouse traffic on commercial satellite imagery.
Operators drove those trucks to presurveyed firing points and then deployed the drones at treetop height.
Because each of the drones was a one-way weapon, a dozen pilots could work in parallel either close to the launch site or remotely, steering live-video feeds toward parked bombers. Videos of the strike suggest multiple near-simultaneous impacts across wide swaths of runway — enough to swamp any ad hoc small-arms response from perimeter guards.
A new front line?
For Ukraine, the episode demonstrates a repeatable method for striking deep, well-defended assets. The same playbook can, in principle, be adapted to missile storage depots and, more importantly, factories across Russia mass-producing Shahed attack drones.
Kyiv has needed to find a way to counter the waves of drones and ballistic missile strikes that in recent months have produced more damage than Russian cruise missiles. The Center for Strategic and International Studies’ Firepower Strike Tracker has shown that Shaheds are now the most frequent and most cost-effective air weapon in Russia’s campaign.
But the implications of Operation Spider Web go far beyond the Russia-Ukraine conflict by undermining the old idea that rear areas are safe. Comparatively inexpensive drones, launched from inside Russia’s own territory, wiped out aircraft that cost billions and underpin Moscow’s long-range strike and nuclear signaling. That’s a strategy than can be easily replicated by other attackers against other countries.
Anyone who can smuggle, hide and pilot small drones can sabotage an adversary’s ability to generate air attacks.
Air forces that rely on large, fixed bases must either harden, disperse or accept that their runway is a new front line.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says AI is ready for entry-level jobs—but unbothered Gen Z have made it their new work friend,https://www.yahoo.com/news/openai-ceo-sam-altman-says-161828662.html,2025-06-05T16:18:28Z,,"OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says AI is ready for entry-level jobs—but unbothered Gen Z have made it their new work friend
Billionaire OpenAI CEO Sam Altman reveals that AI can already perform the tasks of junior-level employees—and the ability for it to work days at a time is just around the corner. With fellow tech leaders like Nvidia’s Jensen Huang saying those who fail to embrace the technology will be replaced, some Gen Zers are catching on.
If you’re in desperate need of an intern, there’s good news: There may soon be an abundance of them. But they might not be able to fetch you a coffee.
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman admitted this week that AI agents—AI-powered systems that can complete job-related tasks with other software tools—can now effectively do the same work as entry-level employees.
“Today [AI] is like an intern that can work for a couple of hours but at some point it’ll be like an experienced software engineer that can work for a couple of days,” Altman said on a panel with Snowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy.
In the coming months, AI agents will only get exponentially better, Altman said—to the point where their skills are just as good as those of an experienced software engineer. They’re anticipated to operate continuously for days on end, without pause.
“I would bet next year that in some limited cases, at least in some small ways, we start to see agents that can help us discover new knowledge, or can figure out solutions to business problems that are very non-trivial,” the 40-year-old AI CEO added. Fortune reached out to Altman for comment.
While this may seem like a grim reality for some workers, the future of human employees’ success may depend on following the advice of tech CEOs like Nvidia’s Jensen Huang. He predicted those who fail to embrace AI might be the next employee to get the pink slip.
“You’re not going to lose your job to an AI, but you’re going to lose your job to someone who uses AI,” he said at the Milken Institute’s Global Conference last month.
Gen Z may be listening to the AI warning signs
Generative AI may be eclipsing the skills of entry-level workers—like conducting research or developing PowerPoints. Some Gen Z have already seen the writing on the wall, and begun embracing the technology more than other age groups. About 51% of Gen Zers now view generative AI just like a coworker or as a friend, according to a recent survey from Resume.org. That’s compared to just over 40% of millennials and 35% of Gen Xers or baby boomers who feel the same way.
Altman has gone even further to say that many young people (including millennials) are turning to AI for far more than just internet sleuthing:
“[It’s a] gross oversimplification, but like older people use ChatGPT as a Google replacement. Maybe people in their twenties and thirties use it as like a life advisor, and then, like people in college use it as an operating system,” Altman said at Sequoia Capital’s AI Ascent event earlier this month.
“And there’s this other thing where [young people] don’t really make life decisions without asking ChatGPT what they should do,” he added.
The alarm bells are still being rung by some tech leaders
Not all tech leaders have been as upbeat about the future, and have instead used their public appearances to highlight fears of an AI-driven job-market reckoning.
According to Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, AI could eliminate half of all entry-level white-collar jobs within five years. Unemployment could skyrocket to 10% to 20%, he told Axios. To put that into context, it’s currently at around 4%. Researchers at his company added that the next decade will be “pretty terrible” for humans as desk jobs are automated, they told tech podcaster Dwarkesh Patel in an interview.
This comes as the latest model of Claude—Anthropic’s generative AI—can now reportedly code autonomously for nearly seven hours.

Inside the battle over prescription drug prices and pharmacies in the Louisiana Legislature,https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/politics/louisiana-senators-propose-new-model-for-prescription-drugs/article_a08fda23-9cb1-5c6e-9fd8-11f81d8b424b.html,"Thu, 05 Jun 2025 09:00:00 -0500",Independent pharmacies gained the upper hand Wednesday against pharmacy benefit managers following a behind-the-scenes lobbying battle over what has been one of the biggest unsettled policy issues in the final days of the regular legislative session.,"Independent pharmacies gained the upper hand Wednesday against pharmacy benefit managers following a behind-the-scenes lobbying battle over what has been one of the biggest unsettled policy issues in the final days of the regular legislative session.
The outcome could affect everyone in Louisiana who buys prescription drugs, especially those who purchase specialty drugs that treat such maladies as diabetes, neuropathy and inattention or hyperactivity.
Pharmacy benefit managers are third-party companies that are supposed to negotiate lower drug prices by acting as middlemen between drug manufacturers, insurance companies and pharmacies. Critics say that pharmacy benefit managers pocket too much of the savings.
A measure passed Wednesday by the Senate Insurance Committee, House Bill 264, favored independent pharmacies by prohibiting pharmacy benefit managers from steering customers to pharmacies they own and by mandating that discounts negotiated by pharmacy benefit managers go to employers and consumers. HB264 also requires pharmacy benefit managers to report more details of their activities to government regulators to ensure that they are following the law.
“Today, the balance has shifted away from large corporations and their profits back to independent pharmacies and the consumers,” Sen. Adam Bass, R-Bossier City, said in an interview following the insurance committee hearing.
Gov. Jeff Landry has sided with the independent pharmacies, saying when he opened the legislative session nearly two months ago that he favors ""reining in the PBMs who are driving the cost of prescriptions."" Landry pitched his views to Republican senators Monday night in the Senate basement, according to senators.
Lobbyists for pharmacy benefit managers had lobbied against HB264 but accepted the changes as inevitable, legislative sources said, to try to head off Louisiana from following Arkansas and adopting more far-reaching legislation that would prohibit pharmacy benefit managers from also owning and operating pharmacies.
Landry also supports that change, according to his staff.
CVS, the biggest drugstore company that owns a pharmacy benefit manager, sued Arkansas a week ago to block the new law there from taking effect. CVS has 23 pharmacies in Arkansas but more than 100 in Louisiana.
The CEO of Caremark, CVS’ pharmacy benefit manager, tried to sway legislators in Louisiana with phone calls, legislators said. The CEO of Optum Rx, another pharmacy benefit manager, came to Baton Rouge to personally lobby lawmakers.
A state website shows that CVS has seven lobbyists working the halls of the State Capitol. They are working in alliance with lobbyists for the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association.
“PBMs secure savings on prescription drugs for Louisiana employers and patients and provide employers with a wide range of choices to offer quality prescription drug coverage,” said Greg Lopes, a spokesperson for the association. “Drug companies set drug prices, and the prices are the problem.”
CVS declined to comment, saying the company is still digesting the last-minute changes to HB264.
The Louisiana Association of Independent Pharmacies and its allies have their own phalanx of lobbyists.
""PBMs shouldn’t be allowed to say one thing and do another behind the scenes,” said Randal Johnson, president of the Louisiana Independent Pharmacies Association. “HB264 attempts to shine a light on rebate flows, bans hidden fees and ensures that what’s paid and what’s reimbursed can actually be traced and reviewed. That’s good policy, and more importantly, it’s pro-patient.""
The heavy lobbying by both sides caught the attention of legislators.
“Every lobbyist here is hired,” said Rep. Dustin Miller, D-Opelousas. “You have CEOs from these companies flying in. There are meetings happening in every room of this building.”
Pharmacy benefit managers became in vogue only in the past dozen years but have quickly faced questions for their activities.
The New York Times reported in a three-part series last year that pharmacy benefit managers operate in an opaque fashion and “are driving up drug costs for millions of people, employers and the government.”
The Trump administration and Congress are moving to adopt less favorable rules for pharmacy benefit managers.
Wednesday’s action is not the final word in the long-running battle in Louisiana between the independent pharmacies and their allies on one side and the pharmacy benefit managers on the other.
The full Senate still needs to approve HB264, and the House would need to agree to the changes made by the Senate before adjournment on June 12.
In the meantime, a separate House measure, House Bill 358 by Miller, could be amended to institute the change that CVS strongly opposes — a prohibition on pharmacy benefit managers from owning or operating pharmacies. House and Senate negotiators are scheduled to meet in the next several days to decide on the final shape of HB358.
“I support any legislation that will stop the anti-competitive practices that I think PBMs do,” Miller said in an interview.
Rep. Mike Echols, R-Monroe, and the sponsor of HB264, also takes a skeptical view of the pharmacy benefit managers.
“We’re putting money into the hands of consumers, which should lower costs,” he told the Senate Insurance Committee.
Driving HB264 forward has been Bass, a 44-year-old Allstate agent who is the vice chair of the insurance committee. Sen. Kirk Talbot, R-Harahan, the committee chair, deputized Bass to try to fashion a bill that could win legislative approval.
Bass said he concluded that pharmacy benefit managers were using their power to block some drugs from coming to market and that employers and consumers are not receiving enough of the discounts negotiated by pharmacy benefit managers with drug manufacturers.
Bass said he met with lobbyists from all sides and worked until midnight with legislative staff late on Monday and Tuesday night to confect the final language for changes in HB264.
The amendments were not shared with lobbyists and some lawmakers until just before Wednesday’s meeting. Echols was quickly familiarizing himself with the changes to his bill just before he presented it Wednesday.
Once the hearing began, Bass explained the changes. A half-hour later, the committee approved the amended bill without objection.
The lobbyists on both sides of the issue got up to depart, leaving behind a nearly empty room as the Senate committee moved onto less controversial measures.",The Advocate,['legislature'],"['Louisiana', 'the Senate Insurance Committee', 'House', 'Bill 264', 'HB264', 'Adam Bass', 'Jeff Landry', 'Senate', 'Louisiana', 'Arkansas', 'Arkansas', 'CVS', 'Arkansas', 'Louisiana', 'Caremark', 'Louisiana', 'Optum Rx', 'Baton Rouge', 'CVS', 'the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association', 'Louisiana', 'Greg Lopes', 'CVS', 'HB264', 'The Louisiana Association of Independent Pharmacies', 'Randal Johnson', 'the Louisiana Independent Pharmacies Association', 'Dustin Miller', 'The New York Times', 'Trump', 'Congress', 'Louisiana', 'Senate', 'HB264', 'House', 'Senate', 'House', 'House', 'Bill 358', 'Miller', 'CVS', 'House', 'Senate', 'HB358', 'Miller', 'Mike Echols', 'the Senate Insurance Committee', 'Bass', 'Kirk Talbot', 'Bass', 'Bass', 'Bass', 'Echols', 'Bass', 'Senate']",
Opinion: Ending U.S.-global health research partnerships will cost America,https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/05/nih-foreign-institutions-subcontracts-research-partners-international-hiv-tb-covid/?utm_campaign=rss,"Thu, 05 Jun 2025 08:30:00 +0000","U.S. research on HIV, tuberculosis, Covid-19, mpox, and other fast-moving epidemics is under threat by a hastily announced NIH policy.","Global health threats don’t respect borders — they require strong collaborations and trust across partners. Yet a new policy from the National Institutes of Health blindsided U.S. researchers and could immediately upend the international research collaborations critical for understanding and responding to global health threats.
Most of NIH’s research is conducted through grants awarded to U.S. universities and research institutions. When these projects involve collaborative work overseas, U.S.-based researchers need to establish subcontracts with international partners who have the local expertise and infrastructure needed to carry out the research.
For example, for a U.S. research team to be able to study the development of HIV drug resistance in sub-Saharan Africa, they need to develop and put in place subcontracts with Africa-based research teams and local clinics providing HIV treatment. Those collaborators can then hire or pay staff members to help the U.S.-based team develop the research protocol that is tailored to the local context, obtain local ethical approval, administer the research project (including consenting of participant volunteers, collection of specimens and other scientific data, conduct laboratory testing), collaborate on data analysis, and co-author scientific manuscripts to disseminate the research findings. Subcontracts outline the scope of work, deliverables, and a budget, and also help ensure scientific and fiscal accountability to the scientists leading the project.
On May 1, without warning NIH announced a disruptive policy that affects both new and active grants, eliminating the use of subcontracts with research partners at institutions outside the U.S. Instead, those institutions must apply to become direct NIH grantees themselves. This policy shift effectively eliminates — sometimes immediately — the support for many of the NIH’s most impactful global scientific collaborations, leaving scientists unable to pay staff or cover operating costs, while they await a yet-to-be-defined process that won’t be available until the end of September at the earliest. The lack of a clear process and guidance on how to move forward is immediately affecting an estimated 1,800 active international health research projects totaling $10 billion in U.S. taxpayer investment, including ongoing clinical trials in which participants are receiving drugs, vaccines, or other interventions under investigation whose impacts are not yet — and may never be — known.
Many of the affected global research projects have not only generated knowledge that has saved lives abroad but also driven innovation here in the U.S. This sweeping policy change effectively slows or halts scientific progress against HIV, tuberculosis, Covid-19, mpox, and other fast-moving epidemics.
The NIH claims this new policy is needed to improve oversight, protect national security, and ensure that research funded by U.S. taxpayers advances U.S. interests. However, it already has systems to help ensure accountability with foreign subcontracts, and there is no evidence of widespread fund misuse justifying an abrupt policy shift that destabilizes global scientific collaborations.
I’ve spent more than 20 years in public health research, leading and collaborating on NIH-supported global studies to improve HIV treatment outcomes, including those aimed at monitoring and strengthening the impact of HIV treatment programs supported by U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria. This research has been vital in helping to improve health outcomes abroad and in seeding innovations that improve HIV care delivery in the U.S. They represent a high return on U.S. taxpayer investment.
One of my international collaborations, focused on optimizing HIV treatment using data from over 40 countries, was abruptly halted due to this new NIH policy. For decades, the work on this project has shaped clinical guidelines, strengthened HIV care systems, and helped prevent infections and deaths among infants, adolescents, and pregnant women. The project, which necessarily included subcontracts to organizations in countries heavily affected by HIV/AIDS, has not been renewed because of these subcontracts, stopping work and payments to collaborators and research staff in the U.S. and abroad. Funding is being withheld while we try to find a way, without any clear guidance, to continue the research without international subcontracts.
That’s not oversight — it’s both obstructive and destructive to critical research collaborations.
This change is also hurting U.S. institutions. These partnerships support U.S. jobs, sustain university-based research teams, and train the next generation of scientists. If the NIH isolates U.S. researchers from the rest of the world, we risk falling behind — not just scientifically, but diplomatically and economically. And the U.S. risks a scientific brain drain. Indeed, as the NIH pulls back, the European Union is recruiting top U.S. scientists.
The rollout process of this policy was especially troubling. It took effect the same day it was released. There was no consultation with grantees, no public comment period, and no transition plan. Changes of this magnitude and with such high-stakes implications should be informed by those who understand how they will play out and deployed with ample lead time to allow transition planning to minimize negative impacts. Instead, the NIH imposed the sweeping policy overnight without transparency or concern for the consequences. That’s not how good policy is made.
This policy did not arise in a vacuum. As an anonymous NIH employee recently wrote that we are witnessing a form of “impoundment” by default — a quiet and corrosive withholding of research dollars that bypasses normal oversight and appropriations processes. With the fiscal year ending in September, these policies and slowdowns in awarding grants mean that billions of dollars earmarked by Congress for NIH-supported science will be lost if they are not disbursed soon.
Many of us were worried that something like this could happen. Beginning in March, as U.S. global and domestic health policy entered a period of rapid change, more than 150 scientists and public health leaders from 41 countries — including me — signed a declaration warning that abrupt, unilateral policies like this one threaten the infrastructure needed to detect and respond to global health threats. The declaration emphasizes the essential need for global cohort studies and collaborations to fill the growing gaps in evidence and situational awareness needed to respond to and ensure continued progress against global health threats.
NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya should immediately pause implementation of this policy, at least until another workable system is in place. He should consult with scientists, funders, and global partners to develop a more workable and transparent path forward. Any new policy should avoid sweeping reforms that abruptly destabilize high-functioning systems without warning or consideration of their consequences.
Instead of an abrupt overhaul, the NIH could have introduced a transition period while finalizing the policy, with structured consultation and clear criteria for when foreign subawards will require enhanced oversight or should be elevated to direct grantees. A smarter, more efficient, and science-friendly policy would build on existing accountability tools while preserving vital scientific collaborations. Any new system should ensure that the lead institution retains both scientific and fiscal oversight of work by international collaborators that is being supported under the project.
If NIH leadership will not act, then the House Committee on Appropriations must examine whether this policy amounts to a backdoor impoundment of funds, effectively defying both Congress and taxpayers.
Global health collaborations depend on trust, continuity, and shared purpose. If we sever those ties now, the world will be slower to detect the next pathogen, lose progress against the current threats, and be more alone when the next crisis hits.
It’s not too late to protect the science and collaborative partnerships that keep us all safer. The NIH should reverse course — before the damage becomes permanent.

Economics correspondent Paul Solman explains the ballooning national debt, how we got here and what it means for our economy and future generations. Read the Full Transcript Notice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors. Amna Nawaz: Republicans in Congress are hashing out a new tax cut and spending bill that's projected to add trillions to the national debt. We will get to some of those specifics in just a moment. Geoff Bennett: But, first, let's take a step back and explain a bit more about our already ballooning national debt, how we got here and what it means for our economy and future generations.Here's economics correspondent Paul Solman. Paul Solman: When we were there the other day, the debt clock that's been in Manhattan since 1989 said our country owed $35 trillion, $903 billion, $414 million.The number's the total of every dollar the U.S. government has borrowed to cover the difference between what it spends and the revenue it collects. That collective debt has long fueled anxiety about how it will burden future generations. Take this ad, which appeared on TV a few years before the clock went up, time so long ago that it's barely video-worthy. Actor: You owe the United States government in round numbers $50,000. Paul Solman: The estimated projection for a baby born today, four times as much. Scary?Natasha Sarin, President, Budget Lab at Yale University: The size and the sort of trajectory of our fiscal path is making a lot of people understandably nervous. Paul Solman: To cover the gap between what the government spends and what it collects, we sell IOUs, call them bonds. About a fifth of our debt is held by different parts of the government itself, while the rest is held by the public, which includes foreign governments, investors and folks like you and me.We rely on this debt to help fund the government. In 2024, that included about $4 trillion on benefit programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and nearly $2 trillion defense and basically everything else. In all, the U.S. spent $1.8 trillion more than it took in, contributing to a national debt that we have been building on and off since the country's founding. Lin-Manuel Miranda, Actor: Welcome to the present. We're running the real nation. Paul Solman: Before he was a Broadway star, our first treasury secretary, Alexander Hamilton, called the young nation's debt the price of liberty and, in the aftermath of the Revolutionary War, advocated for the federal government to take over state debts to cement the colonies into the United States. Lin-Manuel Miranda: If we assume the debts, the Union gets a new line of credit, a financial diuretic. How do you not get it? Paul Solman: The pace of borrowing has ebbed and flowed with peaks due mostly to wartime spending, though, generally, the borrowing ebbed after a crisis was over. But in the aftermath of spending on the war on poverty and Vietnam back in the 1970s, spending again started to rise and hasn't stopped. Kenneth Rogoff, Economist, Harvard University: Our debt relative to our income has doubled in the last 20 years. It has quadrupled since 1980. We borrow very promiscuously, particularly during the financial crisis and during the pandemic.In fact, as things stand now, we owe about as much as all the other large advanced economies put together. Paul Solman: But what's been happening lately? Natasha Sarin: Our society is becoming older, and so more people are Social Security beneficiaries and are getting their Social Security checks. And we haven't scaled up our revenue collection in ways that match that. Paul Solman: And there have also been tax cuts, including during President Trump's first administration in 2017.Donald Trump, President of the United States: It's the largest tax cut in the history of our country. Paul Solman: Those cuts cost about $1.9 trillion over just a decade. Natasha Sarin: Tax reform, or cutting taxes, cutting the revenues that we collect, without raising commensurate revenue to be able to cover the cost of that lower tax burden, and the result is we have every year higher deficits. Paul Solman: So the yearly deficits pile up and keep the total debt swelling? But so what? Today, our debt is approaching levels not seen since the end of World War II. At least so far, our economy sure hasn't collapsed. Far from it. Kenneth Rogoff: If we have problems — we could have another pandemic. We could have a financial crisis. God forbid we could have a war of some type. And we will want to borrow a lot. And the fact our debt is starting so high, it's a risk. It gives us less flexibility for dealing with these things. Paul Solman: Economists say we have gotten a pass because the dollar is the reserve currency, meaning it's the most widely used currency in the world. But that dominance could be slipping. Kenneth Rogoff: Everybody sees, even if we don't, that we are likely to have a problem. And it's not the end of the dollar. It's not going to collapse. But maybe they want to be a little more diversified. Maybe they want to do other things.That further pushes up our interest rates. That makes it more painful. And we're in the thick of this right now. Paul Solman: Look, our IOUs are not free. We pay interest. And the rate on it, it's been rising. In fact, interest is the fastest growing part of the federal budget pie, making up about 13 percent of spending in 2024. That's more than we spent on defense. And the interest pie slice is more than twice what it was just three years before. Natasha Sarin: It's not just that deficits are going to rise and debt levels are going to be higher. What I actually worry about is what it crowds out in the future, because I think that's going to constrain you from things like investing in future generations and children in early childhood education or dealing with the climate crisis that faces us today. Paul Solman: But our debt hasn't stopped investors from buying it. And the idea that the U.S. would stop paying entirely and default seems pretty unlikely.On the other hand, defaults have happened in other countries throughout history and recently after the financial crisis. Natasha Sarin: We have seen sovereign debt crises across Europe, where questions about the viability of debt in countries like Greece were raised, and the sort of drag on those countries, not from just those moments, but from what drawing into question your integrity and your security and stability is a place to lend really, what that means to the economy. And these aren't short-lived impacts. Paul Solman: In Greece, a budget crisis forced the government to cut spending and raise taxes, contracting the economy. Unemployment reached 27 percent in 2013. It's a crisis that took years for the country to recover from.So is the U.S. nearing the point that it can't pay its debts? Kenneth Rogoff: We're not going to literally tell them that we're not going to pay the debt, but there's, of course, a threat of inflation, the — which makes the debt work less. You get paid back in dollars that don't buy as much as when you lent them. By the way, that just happened with the excess inflation that we had in the post-COVID years. Paul Solman: And if our dollars are worthless, the interest lenders would demand to buy our new IOUs would go up, and the more we'd have to borrow to pay the interest. Natasha Sarin: That interest rate won't just be the interest rate that the government owes people who lend to us. It will also trickle down to be the interest rate that you have to pay on your mortgage or the interest rate on your car loan or on your student debt. And all of that matters to households in a way that I suspect we're going to start to feel and we're already really feeling differently now than a decade ago. Paul Solman: So the future of our debt really matters. And how much debt we're about to add is being determined in Congress right now.For the ""PBS News Hour,"" Paul Solman.

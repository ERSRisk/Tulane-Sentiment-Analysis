        "Meet the strangest members of Trump’s inner circle. The strangest members of Trump’s inner circle have more power than they’ve ever had before\nThey have deep connections with secret societies. His brother is in DOGE. And they may or may not be personal friends of Elon Musk. Holly Baxter spends the day with Simone and Malcolm Collins, who believe they can culturally reprogram America — and whose vision seems to be coming true\nIn rural Pennsylvania, I’m hiking through the forest with Simone and Malcom Collins and discussing the executive order they wrote for Donald Trump. Just outside their house — beyond the chicken coop, where they gather their eggs for homemade cakes, and the fenced-in part of the yard where their Corgi, The Professor, plays — is a forest, a small river, and some easy hiking trails. It’s a beautiful day in late spring, and among the greenery and the birdsong, we feel very far from Washington. Yet Simone and Malcolm are surprisingly influential in the Trump administration. I’m here to work out exactly how that happened.\nAs we walk and talk, the day heats up. Malcolm points out a disused mine shaft on the property, and takes us further along to show us the abandoned remnants of railroad leading up to it. Simone suggests we head back to their stone cottage for some homemade lemonade. She’s pregnant with their fifth child; her fourth, one-year-old Industry Americus, is strapped to her back in a carrier. She’s struggling with the walk, but Malcolm insists we carry on a little longer. He likes to show off the scenery.\nIt turns out that the executive order — the controversial “give out motherhood medals to women who’ve had six or more kids” one that caused such a stir recently — was actually written by Simone alone, with some help from AI. Malcolm manages their five-day-a-week podcast schedule, she explains, while she’s responsible for most of their written output. It makes sense to me that Simone would have been the decider on the medals, I say. After all, she’s the one who carries the children. It seems like she’d be the most opinionated on which number of offspring counts as medal-worthy. And of course, she wouldn’t have chosen five, since she’s already achieved that.\nShe laughs. “It’s true,” she says, “that would’ve been awfully convenient for me.” Six, she supposes, is a personal “stretch goal,” so that probably did factor in. But of course, her real stretch goal is fourteen.\nThe Collinses are part of a small but growing movement known as “pronatalism” — the belief that society should actively encourage childbirth, often through incentives or cultural pressure, to stave off civilizational collapse. But they aren’t religious, and they don’t agree with forcing people to have children through rolling back reproductive rights or outright bribes. Instead, they are former Silicon Valley-based tech founders, who use polygenic analysis on their IVF embryos in an effort to select for advantageous traits. There’s some debate about whether the couple — with their bold, thick-rimmed glasses and their penchant for an edgy take — are fringe weirdos or credible commentators. One thing’s for sure: once you scratch the surface of their political connections, it’s clear they have a whole lot of influence for supposed fringe weirdos.\nSo how exactly does a pronatalist couple living in the countryside get their work on Donald Trump’s desk? The Collinses don’t like to talk specifics, but a little digging reveals that they have multiple points of connection with the current administration. For one thing, Malcolm’s brother Miles is in DOGE, the Elon Musk-founded “Department for Government Efficiency” which isn’t really a department. It is, instead, a group of people handpicked by Musk (who recently left the administration, publicly insulted Trump, then walked it all back) who work inside each sector of government, functioning as overseers. Miles and his wife, Brittany, are pronatalists themselves, though they’re much more private about it than Simone and Malcolm: they’ve never even publicly confirmed how many children they have. They’re also entrepreneurs, just like Malcolm and Simone, and they recently co-owned a series of fertility clinics.\nIt’s a common thread among DOGE staffers, who clearly have more in common than simply a passion for businesslike efficiency. Musk has to be the most famous pronatalist on earth at this point, having publicly stated for a number of years that he believes he has a moral imperative to procreate as much as possible. And weeks after the birth of his first child, White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary and DOGE spokesperson Harrison Fields wrote a Mothers’ Day tribute to his wife that read: “Let’s keep building this Fields Family — the more babies who call you Mom, the better.”\nThen there’s JD Vance, whose “childless cat ladies” remark was once considered a faux pas and now looks a lot more like a dog-whistle. The father-of-three has been talking about how he wants “more babies in America” for years. And his brief stint in Silicon Valley — once a bastion of liberal values, now increasingly leaning right — as a venture capitalist made him some friends in very high places. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Google CEO Sundar Pichai were all at Trump’s second inauguration in January.\nThere’s an increasing sense among many that the age of straight-up, populist MAGA is ending. Out of the ashes of the final Trump term, some hope, will emerge a tech-adjacent, anti-woke New Right that is ready to lead America, pioneered by JD Vance and financed by the likes of Thiel and Musk. That may explain the fallout between Musk and Trump not long after Musk departed the White House a few weeks ago. It may also explain why Vance’s reaction to the fallout was noticeably muted.\nThe black sheep of the family\nOn a tour round the Collins house, Simone points out all the different places where 14 children might be able to sleep if she’s able to bear that many. At the moment, she sleeps in a four-poster bed made of dark wood, carefully made up with expensive linens. There’s a crib in the corner, though she usually co-sleeps with Industry. The other three kids — Octavian George (a boy), Torsten Savage (a boy), and Titan Invictus (a girl) — sleep in a triple bunk-bed downstairs. In a closet under the stairs, there’s a twin bed jammed into the space with three sets of ear defenders suspended above. That’s where they put Octavian sometimes, Malcolm says, because he has meltdowns.\nThe decor is mainly in keeping with the old house — painted portraits, a lemon-motif tablecloth — with scattered pieces of aggressive Americana (large flags, a mounted AR-15.) Every room is spotless, except Malcolm’s bedroom, which he quickly closes the door on after we’ve taken a perfunctory peek. Inside, expensive video and audio equipment for the podcast is shoved into a corner, empty cans and food wrappers litter the surfaces and some of the floor, and a gigantic screen looms over the unmade bed.\nMalcolm explains that he’s always been the “black sheep of the family.” He was once suspended from school and sent to a Holes-style juvenile correctional facility for threatening students. What actually happened, he says, is “I was building explosives in my backyard, building switchblade type things,” in the way of lots of young boys in rural Texas. Word got around, and he ended up in the principal’s office, where he was told: “We're really concerned about the thing that you're making, because you could use it to like, kill other students or something.” Malcolm laughs: “I was just like, aghast. I got really angry. I was like: You’re insulting me! That would be such an inefficient way to kill students! If I was gonna kill other students, I'd do it like X and Y and Z.”\nSuch literal-mindedness didn’t go down well with the school, and the school’s reaction didn’t go down well with Malcolm’s parents. They sent him away to what Simone calls “prison camp” and then, after that, to boarding school — he never returned to the family home after the age of 13. After weeks at the correctional facility, he ended up hospitalized with malnourishment and weighing — at over six feet tall — just 90 pounds. “People tried to kill him at that prison camp,” Simone says.\nIt sounds like a harsh upbringing and a traumatic experience. Does Malcolm harbor any resentment toward his family for exposing him to things like that? “No,” he says quickly. After all, he turned out fine in the end. The “urban monoculture” will “try to turn people against their natural support network, which is their birth culture and their family, and try to convince them: hey, you should go to a therapist and what did your parents do to you? What's this trauma you have with your parents?” he says. “I think that there are going to always be malevolent forces that benefit from getting us to blame our parents for things. And I do not think that is good for me to model that to my kids. For example, if I go around talking about, oh, my parents this, my parents that, why would they not adopt the same thing as me? I think it's on all of us to understand that parents generally try to do what's best for their kids. And the more that we are tricked into believing anything else, the easier it is for us to be led culturally astray.”\nWhat counts as Malcolm’s “birth culture” is a little complicated. Simone takes an ornamental mug out of the kitchen cabinet and shows it to me: it belonged to Malcolm’s grandfather when he was in Congress. As I turn over the mug in my hands, Malcolm talks about how he comes from “the greater Appalachian cultural tradition,” where “as a young kid, you do blow things up — you're supposed to blow up army men, you do build explosives, you do make flamethrowers. That's a sign that you are, within this culture, innovative and vitalistic.” It’s a culture of truck nuts and mud-wrestling, he adds, and it’s very egalitarian: the champion female mud-wrestlers, for instance, are afforded a lot of respect in the community.\nDespite his efforts to tell a quintessentially Appalachian backstory, it’s clear that Malcolm — who grew up in Texas — is less JD Vance and more RFK Jr. There’s a Collins Rotunda at Harvard, a physical testament to the amount of money Malcolm’s family has donated over the years. His uncle was the former president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank in Dallas. In fact, pretty much every relative has been to an elite Ivy League institution and runs a successful startup or works in government. Family gatherings are both intellectually stimulating and brutally dog-eat-dog. When he got into Stanford Business School, Malcolm says, he rang his dad in a moment of great excitement and pride to tell him, and his father drily responded: “Their standards must really have dropped.”\nSecret societies and off-the-record retreats\nYou won’t just find members of the Collins family dominating the upper echelons of public and private sector roles; you’ll also find them, if you’re privileged enough, in the underworld of American secret societies. It’s a world that holds a special interest for Malcolm and Simone both.\nSimone was once the managing director of Dialog, a secret society co-run by the billionaire PayPal and Palantir founder Peter Thiel. It’s an experience she calls “eye-opening”. It happened in 2020, when she and Malcolm were both looking for jobs “but he, being a white man, wasn’t going to get one in 2020 for sure,” she says. “Even people who talked with him candidly were like: We really can't hire someone of your profile right now.” Simone, however, was a little more lucky: she got a callback after applying for an interesting-sounding role through a platform called Scouted.\nDialog recruits desirable candidates — based very much on how much money and influence they have — and invites them to off-the-record retreats to discuss the future of America.\n“Even among secret societies or even just invite-only societies and ideas festivals, [Dialog] is definitely the most snobby and exclusive,” Simone says, smiling. “I codified their qualifying criteria — and I know now that they're even more rigorous about it.”\nThe organization had two levels: “Junior Dialog” and then Dialog proper, “and at that time — so I'm sure it's more expensive now to attend — Junior Dialog was maybe $6,000 or something” for a three-day retreat, while “adult Dialog was like $15,000,” she says. The Dialog retreats are held in isolated places like the middle of the Utah desert, and they’re “extremely high-touch,” meaning that everyone is expected to participate in debate and conversation — “as in, you get kicked out if you don’t participate.” Every conversation has a chosen moderator, sometimes a Dialog staff member and sometimes a participant, and that moderator will “rate every single participant.” At the end, the ratings are tallied up, and the people with the lowest ratings are kicked out immediately. “They will even kick people out in the middle of the event,” Simone adds. “And these are people who have paid $15,000 to be here.”\nIn Simone’s opinion, the criteria can be a little harsh. In Malcolm’s, however, they’re completely reasonable. “The main reason you would get kicked out is if [you were trying] to shut down controversial conversations by being like: You can’t talk like this, this is offensive and I’m gonna shame you,” he says, adding that that’s something the urban monoculture does all the time in the wider world. He thinks it’s fair enough to excommunicate someone for behaving that way, “because people were preventing open and honest conversation.”\nHow does one get noticed by the Dialog staff, and therefore invited to their secret retreats, in the first place? There are “various criteria” that might get you an invitation, says Simone, along the lines of: “Has your startup raised over $50 million? Do you have 500,000 followers on social media plus a huge media impact, or are you a famous international advocate? How many news stories are out about you?” You have to hit a number of these to be able to come along, adds Simone, and even she and Malcolm don’t qualify for Dialog anymore. “So it’s very elite,” Malcolm clarifies.\nHe would know. The Collins family has long had connections in secret societies, if the rumors are to be believed. The Bohemian Club, an all-male secret society that operates the annual retreat Bohemian Grove and whose members have included a number of US presidents, made the news a year ago when it was reported that Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas had attended with a billionaire friend. Malcolm’s godfather was supposedly also a high-ranking member.\nThese days, however, retreats like Bohemian Grove — often referred to as a “summer camp” for the super rich and powerful — are being eclipsed by edgier, weirder alternatives. Hereticon is the most famous, with its own clandestine annual conference — “The Apocalypse Ball” — that wannabe attendees can apply to via Google Doc. Questions on the application include: “What apocalypse are you currently focused on (realizing or preventing)?”\nMalcolm says that Hereticon is “the best secret society in the world right now.” Past attendees have said that the annual Apocalypse Ball includes activities like getting tattooed on the spot, taking home your own genetically engineered frog embryo (you get to insert a genetic quirk, such as bioluminescence or albinism or a gene to make the frog grow extremely large, with the help of an on-hand scientist), and attending off-the-record salons with speakers who have been “cancelled” or are “ideological outcasts” in mainstream society. Where Bohemian Grove was a nostalgic summer camp with suits, Hereticon is a technicolor playground for rich and powerful people who insist on their supposed underdog status. Backed by Peter Thiel’s venture capital firm, Founders’ Fund, it hosts discussions on issues like how to achieve immortality, “transhumanism” (i.e. enhancing the human body with robotics and other tech), and UFOs. In 2022, Grimes — the musician and mother of three of Elon Musk’s children — posted a selfie from Hereticon, where she appears to have done a surprise DJ set that year, as well as in early 2024.\nWas the richest man in the world himself in attendance? It seems likely, but Simone and Malcolm are cagey about anything relating to Musk. In the large, low-ceilinged kitchen of their stone house, Simone looks up a recipe for lemon cake and then starts to make it, pouring from an industrial-sized bag of flour and using eggs from the coop outside. Industry dozes on Simone’s back, clutching a toy scavenged during our slow drift from room to room earlier. A little “Trump 2025” flag is placed conspicuously in a vase on top of the refrigerator, and Malcolm is bouncing a child’s playground ball off the hard floor again and again as he describes how he sees himself as a superhero fighting Thanos when he stands up to the urban monoculture.\nThey vacillate between domestic asides and political commentary: Simone brings out a black-and-white picture of the owners of the house from the 1800s; Malcolm talks about how transgender people have unfairly taken over the LGBT conversation and put off the “normal gays”; Simone describes how she was brainwashed by liberal thinking after her upbringing in California, and how Malcolm helped her see that during an impassioned conversation on their first date; Malcolm glances out the window and points out some DIY that he needs to attend to outside. Simone is wearing a white bonnet that Malcolm encouraged her to put on after we arrived, because they like to wind people up with exaggerated tradwife-style costumes. Malcolm is dressed in a polo shirt and jeans.\nSimone offers round seltzer waters; Malcolm brings out a six-pack of Coors Light for himself and starts on the first. What’s bothering me, I say, is that, despite their various connections in high places, I still don’t entirely understand how they got that draft executive order in front of Trump. Malcolm is clear that he and his brother do not have “career conversations”. He mentions that The New York Times criticized their motherhood medal idea and, in doing so, amplified it. But a newspaper can only do so much, I say. What about Elon Musk? He’s an extremely prominent pronatalist. At the time of the executive order, he was spending every day at the White House. Do you ever have conversations with him?\nThe mood in the room dramatically shifts. Malcolm trains his eyes on the floor. “He has never funded our organization,” he says, eventually, “and a lot of people believe he has. That's what I can say about that.”\nI push a little harder. I’m not asking about money towards pronatalist causes, I say, but just pronatalism in general, as a political aim without finances involved. Have they ever sat down and had a chat with Elon Musk about that?\nSilence again. “What I can say is that he hasn’t funded us,” Malcolm repeats, eyes still on the ground.\nI turn to look at Simone, who’s now sitting in the corner with Industry on her lap. “I think I hear what you’re saying,” I say, and she catches my eye and smiles. It’s not a denial, but it is plausible deniability.\nChanging society through AI\nSimone and Malcolm own another small house on their property, where their neighbors live rent-free so long as they can provide day-to-day childcare. But even with such nearby help, parenting is still hard. Both Octavian and Torsten are autistic. They each have very firm food preferences and eat restricted diets, and they get overstimulated easily. A lot of the time, every person in the house eats a different meal, in different rooms to each other.\nThe Collinses have friends in the pronatalist movement, people with similarly large families with whom they can trade tips and tricks. Once, Malcolm says, he asked one of those families how they approach a situation where a child really seems to be struggling, such as refusing to eat anything except white rice due to sensory issues. What do you do to tamp down the anxiety? Their response, he says, was refreshing: “Just have more kids!” It reminded him that such modern stressors would never have bothered their ancestors, and that a lot of the time, children work things out on their own.\nThe pronatalist movement is “very diverse,” Simone says, as we discuss further the families that they know. There are Catholics, tradwife types, tech-forward New Right devotees like the Collinses themselves. It does sound diverse, I say, in some ways. But where are the progressive pronatalists? Do they know any?\nThey stop talking for a moment and Simone says, “Hmm.” Eventually, they concede they don’t know any, but that there probably are some out there. Maybe they’re too shy to declare themselves because of the liberal order. Perhaps they’ve been blinded by the urban monoculture and feel like they should have fewer children than they really want.\nBack from an afternoon with the neighbors, Titan and Torsten come running up the garden path and into the house. Malcolm redirects them into the fenced-off yard, where Titan — a ball of energy with her hair in pigtails — pokes at the chickens in the coop and Torsten — more quiet and reticent — stops to examine my photographer’s camera. Industry is still on Simone’s back, occasionally dozing and babbling to herself; Octavian is at kindergarten, and will come home later on the school bus. As the family gathers together for a photo, Malcolm chases Torsten across the grass and throws him over his shoulder. They’re all wearing yellow shoes, Malcolm and Simone included. Malcolm explains that it’s a family policy, as it’s an easy way to identify each other from afar.\nAlthough Octavian goes to kindergarten at the local public school, Malcolm says, they plan to educate the kids primarily via AI — hopefully through their own educational startup, The Collins Institute, if they can secure funding. With potentially fourteen children in the home, Octavian, Torsten, Titan, Industry, soon-to-be-born baby Tex and their siblings will have very different opportunities to Malcolm, who grew up with just one brother, and Simone, who was an only child.\nThat’s true, says Malcolm, but his family gave him “no inheritance” anyway — the only thing they did was pay for college. Can Malcolm and Simone afford to do the same and pay their kids through college? No, but college isn’t worth it any more, they say. It’s just a breeding ground for liberal indoctrination. AI will replace it, and that can’t happen soon enough.\nThe Collinses are confident that AI is going to rapidly change society — politically, academically, and socially — and that the New Right will be at the forefront of that change. Recent developments suggest that they’re correct, and that the current administration is particularly invested. In mid-June, executives from OpenAI, Palantir and Meta were sworn in as Army Reserve officers after the Department of Defense awarded them each multimillion-dollar contracts to build a solid AI component for future “warfighting”. And Trump’s so-called Big, Beautiful Bill includes one extremely unusual element: an effective ban on states implementing any AI regulations for at least 10 years.\nMalcolm believes that as his kids grow up, they will remain ideologically aligned with him. AI education will help with that; they won’t be indoctrinated by teachers into the urban monoculture, and they’ll be able to explore their own personal interests through the help of a personalized AI tutor. With four kids under the age of five and another on the way, the Collinses have no problem with family rows over politics at the moment. But I wonder what a house full of teenagers as headstrong as Malcolm and Simone will look like in the future.\nIt’s getting late in the afternoon. As we exit the house and start saying our goodbyes, Titan follows us down the path, shrieking and getting under Malcolm’s feet. She is a rambunctious, happy little girl who bears a striking resemblance to her father. Simone, keeping an eye on Torsten and still hauling Industry, hangs back at the house.\n“Do you wish you weren’t born?” Malcolm asks Titan repeatedly, as they stand at the gate and watch us walk towards our car. “Are you glad you’re alive?”\nTitan just looks back at him in confusion and laughs. She is, after all, only three years old.\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments",
        "Tucker Carlson leads MAGA's worried warriors in questioning Trump. As President Donald Trump weighed U.S. involvement in the conflict between Israel and Iran last month, some influential members of his online MAGA army began to question what he was doing.\nBut few were prominent enough to face a direct response from the president.\n“Somebody please explain to kooky Tucker Carlson that, ‘IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON!’” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.\n“I don’t know what Tucker Carlson is saying,” Trump said in response to a reporter’s question at the Group of Seven summit the same day. “Let him go get a television network and say it so that people listen.”\nIn the course of a few weeks, Trump has faced a surprising level of pushback from prominent supporters as he moved to strike nuclear facilities in Iran, floated a new policy to allow undocumented farmworkers to remain in the United States and castigated allies for demanding more information related to the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Even in that environment, Carlson, regarded as a MAGA standard-bearer, stood out.\n“I like Trump. I campaigned for Trump,” Carlson said in an interview, adding: “But I’ve got my views. I assume that we will overlap on most things, and I hope that, by the way, the bombing of the nuclear sites in Iran, which I did not support, I hope it works out great, and I’ll be grateful if it does. And I’ll be the first to say I was wrong for the millionth time in my life.”\nIn June, Carlson said Trump was “complicit in the act of war” as Israel launched attacks on Iran. (Trump later said Carlson “called and apologized.”) One month before, Carlson echoed concerns about Trump’s business dealings in the Middle East, saying “it seems like corruption” when Shawn Ryan, a guest on his program, raised alarm about new Trump properties in the region. And now, he is taking the administration to task for declining to release additional information about Epstein, with whom Trump had a yearslong friendship before a falling-out.\n“The fact that the U.S. government, the one that I voted for, refused to take my question seriously and instead said, ‘Case closed, shut up conspiracy theorist,’ was too much for me,” Carlson said Friday at the Turning Point USA Student Action Summit, where he devoted his speech to the issue. “And I don’t think the rest of us should be satisfied with that.”\nCarlson emphasized his personal admiration for Trump but took issue with his response to the furor over the Epstein files. At a Cabinet meeting last week, Trump brushed off growing discontent and said it was “a desecration” to ask about Epstein after flooding in Texas killed dozens.\n“It’s not adequate to say anyone who asked [questions] is somehow desecrating the memory of little girls who died in Texas,” Carlson said in his speech Friday, adding: “I don’t care who gives that answer. That is not acceptable.”\nCarlson’s frustrations represent broader discontent in MAGA world with the policies of the man who brought it together. It’s a key moment for the movement, which for the past decade has been largely in lockstep, testing whether it’s willing to truly break with Trump and whether anyone besides Trump can shape its direction.\n‘I was never an important adviser to Trump’\nAsked about his direct discussions with Trump, Carlson said he “certainly had a lot of conversations with him,” though he declined to say when the two men last spoke.\n“I’m not a policymaker,” he said. “I’m just a guy with opinions. I don’t work there. I’ve never worked in any government. I’ve never taken any money from any politician or any government, and I just have strong views, which, by the way, are sometimes wrong, really wrong. I supported the Iraq War. So my track record is spotty.”\nAnd Carlson said he was unaware whether his influence in the White House has waned in light of his recent commentary.\n“I was never an important adviser to Trump,” he said. “It was always kind of overstated.”\nCarlson was center stage among MAGA influencers arguing for the United States to stay out of Iran, a position that has gained popularity on the right as some right-wing influencers have increasingly viewed the U.S.-Israel alliance with skepticism. That stance is also informed by Trump’s having promoted similar anti-war and anti-interventionist views for years, even as he has used military force as president. Ultimately, Carlson said, the most important voice arguing the case to Trump for the U.S. bombing of Iran’s nuclear facilities was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n“Turns out a head of state of an important ally has a more compelling message than I do,” he said. “That seems reasonable to me. I still disagree, but I don’t think it’s like Trump has changed his views entirely.”\nSome around Trump have taken a victory lap given that he ultimately didn’t ally with Carlson on military action in Iran.\n“The Iran operation was both a shot at the Iranians, but it was also a shot at the restrainers of the administration and at Tucker and everyone else who said the president is never going to do this,” a Trump ally close to the administration said. “They think he’s an ideologue like they are, and he isn’t. These guys overplayed their hands.”\nTrump’s relationship with Carlson has had peaks and valleys dating to his first administration. Most notably, during Dominion Voting Systems’ 2023 court battle against Fox News, the judge made public text messages showing Carlson’s trashing Trump amid his effort to overturn his 2020 loss, in which he privately said, “I hate him passionately.”\n“He’s never been a natural ally of the president,” a second Trump ally said, pointing to the texts.\nBut the two reconciled during Trump’s third run for the White House as both were in exile: Carlson having been ousted from Fox News as part of the fallout over the Dominion lawsuit and Trump facing multiple indictments, including in connection with his role in trying to reverse his 2020 defeat.\nWhen Carlson was forced out of his show in 2023, Trump said he was “shocked,” adding, “He’s a very good person and a very good man and very talented, as you know, and he had very high ratings.” The strengthening of their relationship led Carlson to campaign for Trump, including in a prime-time speaking slot at last summer’s Republican convention.\nGiven Carlson’s stature in the MAGA movement, prominent Trump allies have come to his defense. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said last month that Carlson “is one of my favorite people.” Arguing against intervention in Iran, she added, was “not kooky.”\nSteve Bannon, the former White House aide and MAGA media personality, who occupies a perch similar to Carlson’s, said the brouhaha between the two men comes during “a time of turmoil” when Trump is handling a number of crises at once. He said Carlson is “still one of the leaders of our movement and an incredibly strong, independent voice.”\n“Tucker has always worked at this a little more with a jaundiced eye,” Bannon said. “He came to this movement late. He waited and measured it. He respects President Trump; he supported President Trump. When Tucker took on the ruling class, it was a seminal moment for MAGA — because he did it on Fox prime time. Since then, Tucker has been there for ‘America First,’ especially when it mattered most.”\nMore broadly, Bannon said, MAGA influencers and thought leaders have to call out policy decisions that veer from base expectations in hope of ensuring their perspective is represented.\n“You’ve got to represent every day and continue to make sure that people understand, particularly people around President Trump, and sometimes even the president himself, understands where we think core values lie,” Bannon said.\n‘A dissident figure’\nIt’s not as if Carlson hadn’t publicly criticized Trump or his administration before. He similarly sounded the alarm in 2020 when the United States killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, and he criticized Trump’s handling of national protests after Minneapolis police murdered George Floyd later that year. While such pushback isn’t new, a person close to Carlson said he has never crossed the line into all-consuming criticism such as Matt Drudge or Ann Coulter, other conservative media personalities who have sharply broken with Trump.\n“Tucker’s not being malicious towards the president at all,” a source close to the White House said. “You can very easily still support somebody and disagree with a specific policy decision. Agree with him or disagree with him, Tucker is at least coming from a sincere place of love and concern for the president. He just wants the president to be successful and is worried that issues like amnesty, Epstein, Ukraine funding and war in the Middle East could eventually lead to his presidency being derailed.”\nTrump maintains high approval ratings with the Republican base, which is informing how he and the White House view the pushback online. An Economist/YouGov survey published Tuesday found that 87% of Republicans approve of Trump’s handling of his job so far.\n“The president cares deeply about the MAGA base; he is very responsive to them,” a person familiar with the White House’s thinking said.\nThis person pointed to online chatter last week about whether Trump would offer some sort of “amnesty” after he talked up an effort at a rally to allow undocumented farmworkers to stay in the country, noting that at a Cabinet meeting, Trump was responsive to the concerns and said there would be “no amnesty.”\n“Things like that are notable when thinking about how the president balances the viewpoints he’s getting,” the person added. “And a lot of what he’s done recently are direct responses to so many of the campaign promises made to the base.”\nA MAGA thought leader described Trump and Carlson as “two of the great minds of MAGA,” saying the movement wouldn’t exist in its current form without either one. This person worried the MAGA perspective was “getting a little squeezed out of the inner circle” at the White House on several issues of note.\n“People are not going to go along with endless war,” this person said. “And when they see the capitulation on Epstein, it just hurts. The Trump administration made overtures that they were serious about this. But six months in and kind of trying to tie a bow around it, it’s just not satisfying. That’s not going to sit well.”\nNo other issue has tested the MAGA base’s commitment to Trump like the Epstein files.\nFor years, many on the right — including some people who are now in the Trump administration — have called for the release of all government documents related to Epstein. Epstein died in custody in 2019, and a medical examiner ruled his death a suicide. He was facing sex trafficking and conspiracy charges.\nLast week, Attorney General Pam Bondi released a memo saying the Justice Department’s review turned up no “client list” of powerful men alleged to have participated in Epstein’s schemes, enraging the MAGA base, who are calling on her to be fired. Trump’s defense of Bondi and his attempts to tell his supporters to move on from the issue have done little to quell the furor.\nOn Saturday, Trump wrote “LET PAM BONDI DO HER JOB — SHE’S GREAT!” on Truth Social, adding the United States should “not waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein, somebody that nobody cares about.”\nIn his NBC News interview, Carlson said he now believes the Justice Department actually doesn’t have “much relevant information about Jeffrey Epstein’s sex crimes.”\n“Rather than just admit that, Pam Bondi made a bunch of ludicrous claims on cable news shows that she couldn’t back up, and this current outrage is the result,” he said.\nA Republican Senate aide thinks Carlson is actually having a bit of a “revival” as he carves out distinct space on the right.\n“He’s more of a dissident figure now,” this person said. “For whatever else you’re going to say, Tucker is just kind of saying what he thinks.”\nNo recent moment generated more buzz for Carlson than his contentious and combative interview with Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, which put the MAGA divide over the conflict between Israel and Iran on full display. Even with the administration not siding with him, Carlson said he’s “really grateful” that there’s significant debate on the right over a litany of policy issues.\nAs for his assessment of the first six months of Trump’s second presidency, he said, “I think they’re trying.”\n“The most important thing, not just for Republicans, not even for all the first-time Republican voters who supported Trump, but just for the country,” Carlson said, “is to make it clear that you’re trying to achieve what you said you would achieve.”",

Following his inauguration on January 20, 2025, Trump became only the second president to serve two nonconsecutive terms, the first being Grover Cleveland (1885–89; 1893–97). In January 2025, upon his sentencing without punishment for a felony conviction in 2024, Trump officially became the first convicted felon to be elected president. At age 78, Trump is the oldest person to win the office.\nTrump’s conviction took place on May 30, 2024, when a New York state jury found him guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with a hush-money payment in 2016 to the adult-film star Stephanie Clifford, known as Stormy Daniels, who claimed to have had an affair with Trump in 2006. He had also been indicted on dozens of other federal and state charges in cases relating to his efforts to overturn his defeat in the presidential election of 2020 and his removal of numerous classified documents from the White House upon leaving office. Following Trump’s election to a second term, special counsel Jack Smith, who led both federal criminal cases against Trump, requested that the election-related charges against Trump be dropped and that Trump be removed from the group of codefendants in the classified documents case. Smith’s decisions reflected a Justice Department policy that prohibits the criminal prosecution of a sitting president.\nTrump was also found liable in a major civil suit alleging business fraud in New York state and in two civil suits accusing him of sexually abusing and defaming the writer E. Jean Carroll.\nTrump is the third president in U.S. history (after Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998) to be impeached by the U.S. House of Representatives and the only president to be impeached twice—once (in 2019) for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress in connection with the Ukraine scandal and once (in 2021) for “incitement of insurrection” in connection with the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by a violent mob of Trump supporters. Both of Trump’s impeachments ended in his acquittal by the U.S. Senate.\nAfter the midterm elections of 2022, Trump declared his intention to run for a second term, and in primary elections in early 2024 he accumulated enough delegates to win his party’s nomination, despite the steady progress of the legal cases against him. Although some Republican Party leaders worried that a criminal trial could seriously weaken Trump’s appeal to moderate Republican and independent voters, others took the hopeful view that Trump would use his court appearances to solidify his support by casting himself as a political martyr—the victim of Democratic-led “witch hunts,” “hoaxes,” and “scams,” as he frequently characterized the many legal investigations he faced.\nTrump is also a real estate developer and businessman who has owned, managed, or licensed his name to hotels, casinos, golf courses, resorts, and residential properties in the New York City area and around the world. Since the 1980s Trump has lent his name to scores of retail ventures—including branded lines of clothing, cologne, food, and furniture. In the early 21st century his private conglomerate, the Trump Organization, comprised some 500 companies involved in a wide range of businesses, including hotels and resorts, residential properties, merchandise, and entertainment and television.\nEarly life and business career\nTrump was the fourth of five children of Frederick (Fred) Christ Trump, a successful real estate developer, and Mary MacLeod. Donald’s eldest sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, eventually served as a U.S. district court judge (1983–99) and later as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit until her retirement in 2011. His elder brother, Frederick, Jr. (Freddy), worked briefly for their father’s business before becoming an airline pilot in the 1960s. Freddy’s alcoholism led to his early death in 1981, at the age of 43.\nBeginning in the late 1920s, Fred Trump built hundreds of single-family houses and row houses in the Queens and Brooklyn boroughs of New York City, and from the late 1940s he built thousands of apartment units, mostly in Brooklyn, using federal loan guarantees designed to stimulate the construction of affordable housing. During World War II he also built federally backed housing for naval personnel and shipyard workers in Virginia and Pennsylvania. In 1954 Fred was investigated by the Senate Banking Committee for allegedly abusing the loan-guarantee program by deliberately overestimating the costs of his construction projects to secure larger loans from commercial banks, enabling him to keep the difference between the loan amounts and his actual construction costs. In testimony before the Senate committee in 1954, Fred admitted that he had built the Beach Haven apartment complex in Brooklyn for $3.7 million less than the amount of his government-insured loan. Although he was not charged with any crime, he was thereafter unable to obtain federal loan guarantees. A decade later a New York state investigation found that Fred had used his profit on a state-insured construction loan to build a shopping center that was entirely his own property. He eventually returned $1.2 million to the state but was thereafter unable to obtain state loan guarantees for residential projects in the Coney Island area of Brooklyn.\nDonald Trump attended New York Military Academy (1959–64), a private boarding school; Fordham University in the Bronx (1964–66); and the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Finance and Commerce (1966–68), where he graduated with a bachelor’s degree in economics. In 1968, during the Vietnam War, he secured a diagnosis of bone spurs, which qualified him for a medical exemption from the military draft (he had earlier received four draft deferments for education). Upon his graduation Trump began working full-time for his father’s business, helping to manage its holdings of rental housing, then estimated at between 10,000 and 22,000 units. In 1974 he became president of a conglomeration of Trump-owned corporations and partnerships, which he later named the Trump Organization.\nDuring the 1960s and early 1970s, Trump-owned housing developments in New York City, Cincinnati, Ohio, and Norfolk, Virginia, were the target of several complaints of racial discrimination against African Americans and other minority groups. In 1973 Fred and Donald Trump, along with their company, were sued by the U.S. Justice Department for allegedly violating the Fair Housing Act (1968) in the operation of 39 apartment buildings in New York City. The Trumps initially countersued the Justice Department for $100 million, alleging harm to their reputations. The suit was settled two years later under an agreement that did not require the Trumps to admit guilt.\nIn the late 1970s and the 1980s, Donald Trump greatly expanded his father’s business by investing in luxury hotels and residential properties and by shifting its geographic focus to Manhattan and later to Atlantic City, New Jersey. In doing so, he relied heavily on loans, gifts, and other financial assistance from his father, as well as on his father’s political connections in New York City. In 1976 he purchased the decrepit Commodore Hotel near Grand Central Station under a complex profit-sharing agreement with the city that included a 40-year property tax abatement, the first such tax break granted to a commercial property in New York City. Relying on a construction loan guaranteed by his father and the Hyatt Corporation, which became a partner in the project, Trump refurbished the building and reopened it in 1980 as the 1,400-room Grand Hyatt Hotel. In 1983 he opened Trump Tower, an office, retail, and residential complex constructed in partnership with the Equitable Life Assurance Company. The 58-story building on 56th Street and Fifth Avenue eventually contained Trump’s Manhattan residence and the headquarters of the Trump Organization. Other Manhattan properties developed by Trump during the 1980s include the Trump Plaza residential cooperative (1984), the Trump Parc luxury condominium complex (1986), and the 19-story Plaza Hotel (1988), a historic landmark for which Trump paid more than $400 million.\nIn the 1980s Trump invested heavily in the casino business in Atlantic City, where his properties eventually included Harrah’s at Trump Plaza (1984, later renamed Trump Plaza), Trump’s Castle Casino Resort (1985), and the Trump Taj Mahal (1990), then the largest casino in the world. During that period Trump also purchased the New Jersey Generals, a team in the short-lived U.S. Football League; Mar-a-Lago, a 118-room mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, built in the 1920s by the cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post; a 282-foot yacht, then the world’s second largest, which he named the Trump Princess; and an East Coast air-shuttle service, which he called Trump Shuttle.\nIn 1977 Trump married Ivana Zelníčková Winklmayr, a Czech model, with whom he had three children—Donald, Jr., Ivanka, and Eric—before the couple divorced in 1992. Their married life, as well as Trump’s business affairs, were a staple of the tabloid press in New York City during the 1980s. Trump married the American actress Marla Maples after she gave birth to Trump’s fourth child, Tiffany, in 1993. Their marriage ended in divorce in 1999. In 2005 Trump married the Slovene model Melania Knauss, and their son, Barron, was born the following year. Melania Trump became the second foreign-born first lady of the United States upon Trump’s inauguration as president in 2017.\nWhen the U.S. economy fell into recession in 1990, many of Trump’s businesses suffered, and he soon had trouble making payments on his approximately $5 billion debt, some $900 million of which he had personally guaranteed. Under a restructuring agreement with several banks, Trump was forced to surrender his airline, which was taken over by US Airways in 1992; to sell the Trump Princess; to take out second or third mortgages on nearly all of his properties and to reduce his ownership stakes in them; and to commit himself to living on a personal budget of $450,000 a year. Despite those measures, the Trump Taj Mahal declared bankruptcy in 1991, and two other casinos owned by Trump, as well as his Plaza Hotel in New York City, went bankrupt in 1992. Following those setbacks, most major banks refused to do any further business with him. Estimates of Trump’s net worth during this period ranged from $1.7 billion to minus $900 million.\nTrump’s fortunes rebounded with the stronger economy of the later 1990s and with the decision of the Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank AG to establish a presence in the U.S. commercial real estate market. Deutsche Bank extended hundreds of millions of dollars in credit to Trump in the late 1990s and the 2000s for projects including Trump World Tower (2001) in New York and Trump International Hotel and Tower (2009) in Chicago. In the early 1990s Trump had floated a plan to his creditors to convert his Mar-a-Lago estate into a luxury housing development consisting of several smaller mansions, but local opposition led him instead to turn it into a private club, which was opened in 1995. In 1996 Trump partnered with the NBC television network to purchase the Miss Universe Organization, which produced the Miss Universe, Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA beauty pageants. Trump’s casino businesses continued to struggle, however: in 2004 his company Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts filed for bankruptcy after several of its properties accumulated unmanageable debt, and the same company, renamed Trump Entertainment Resorts, went bankrupt again in 2009.\nBeginning in the mid-2000s, Trump enjoyed an enormous financial windfall from the success of The Apprentice, a reality television series in which he starred that directly earned him nearly $200 million over a 16-year period. The Emmy-nominated show, in each episode of which Trump “fired” one or more contestants competing for a lucrative one-year contract as a Trump employee, further enhanced his reputation as a shrewd businessman and self-made billionaire. In 2008 the show was revamped as The Celebrity Apprentice, which featured news makers and entertainers as contestants.\nTrump marketed his name as a brand in numerous other business ventures, including Trump Financial, a mortgage company, and the Trump Entrepreneur Initiative (formerly Trump University), an online education company focusing on real estate investment and entrepreneurialism. The latter firm, which ceased operating in 2011, was the target of class-action lawsuits by former students and a separate action by the attorney general of New York state, alleging fraud. After initially denying the allegations, Trump settled the lawsuits for $25 million in November 2016. In 2019, more than two years into his presidency, Trump agreed to pay $2 million in damages and to admit guilt to settle another lawsuit by the attorney general of New York that had accused him of illegally using assets from his charity, the Trump Foundation, to fund his 2016 presidential campaign. As part of the settlement, the Trump Foundation was dissolved.\nIn 2018 The New York Times published a lengthy investigative report that documented how Fred Trump had regularly transferred vast sums of money, ultimately amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars, to his children by means of strategies that involved tax, securities, and real estate fraud, as well as by legal means. According to the report, Donald Trump was the main beneficiary of the transfers, having received the equivalent (in 2018 dollars) of $413 million by the early 2000s. According to a later report by the Times, based on data from tax returns filed by Trump during an 18-year period starting in 2000, Trump paid no federal taxes in 11 years and only $750 in each of two years, 2016 and 2017. Trump was able to reduce his tax obligations to levels significantly below the average for the wealthiest Americans by claiming massive losses on many of his businesses; by deducting as business expenses costs associated with his residences and his personal aircraft; and by receiving, on the basis of business losses, a tentative refund from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of nearly $73 million, which more than covered the federal taxes Trump had paid on income he received from The Apprentice in 2005–08. The refund became the subject of an IRS audit and a legally mandated review by the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation.\nTrump was credited as coauthor of a number of books on entrepreneurship and his business career, including Trump: The Art of the Deal (1987), Trump: The Art of the Comeback (1997), Why We Want You to Be Rich (2006), Trump 101: The Way to Success (2006), and Trump Never Give Up: How I Turned My Biggest Challenges into Success (2008)."

        "NLC seeks implementation of 2021 revised CONMESS For Vet doctors in Kogi - QUICK NEWS AFRICA. The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has urged Gov. Ahmed Ododo to approve the implementation of the 2021 revised Consolidated Medical Salary Structure (CONMESS) for veterinary doctors in Kogi.\nThe state Chairman of NLC, Mr Gabriel Amari, made the call while speaking with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lokoja.\nAmari expressed concerns over the disparities in the salaries of health workers in Kogi, and called for the immediate implementation of the 2021 revised CONMESS for veterinary doctors in the state.\n“We passionately request the governor to look into the non-implementation of the revised CONMESS for the state Veterinary Doctors.\n“This is imperative because, in January 2021, the immediate past governor , Alhaji Yahaya Bello, approved the implementation of revised CONMESS for doctors in the state civil service.\n“Regrettably, the implementation was done for only medical doctors in the state while the state Veterinary Doctors were excluded. It is important to note that globally, both medical and veterinary doctors are remunerated equally.\n“Therefore, it is only equitable that they receive same treatment in Kogi.\n“We earnestly implore the governor’s to intervention to rectify this disparity and ensure that state veterinary doctors are granted same consideration as their medical doctor counterparts,” Amari said.\nThe labour leader also demanded for the implementation of previous agreements on promotions, leave bonus, annual increment and other allowances.\nAmari noted that the current N30,000 National Minimum Wage fell short of meeting basic needs of workers in the prevailing market conditions of the country.\nHe added: “we advocate for the immediate implementation of a Wage Award totaling around N35,000 in Kogi State.\n“This adjustment is not only fair but also urgent, given the relentless rise in the costs of goods and services, which continuously erodes the purchasing power of Workers.\n“Until the long-awaited negotiations for a new minimum wage are concluded and put into effect, the Wage Award would serve as a temporary relief for Workers grappling with the current economic hardships”.. (NAN)",
        "AfCFTA Adjustment Fund Injects $10 Million into Telecel Global Services. • The African Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) adjustment fund grants a $10 million loan to Telecel Global Services to boost digital connectivity and commercial integration in Africa.\n• This financing, in the form of a guaranteed first rank repayable loan, marks the fund's first transaction and will support Telecel's expansion in Ghana and Liberia as well as bolster its infrastructure.\nTelecel Global Services has secured $10 million from the African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank), the lender announced in a statement dated July 7, 2025. According to the source, the monies will finance Telecel's expansion in Ghana and Liberia and help the firm improve its infrastructure. The move supports the telco’s efforts to boost digital connectivity and commercial integration in Africa.\nThis funding, a guaranteed first rank repayable loan, constitutes the first transaction of the AfCFTA Adjustment Fund. This Fund was created to provide financial and technical support to governments and businesses, helping them transition to the new trade regime, as well curb any negative impact that could arise in this process.\nThe Adjustment Fund was set up by Afreximbank and the AfCFTA’s secretariat. It has three sub-funds: the basic fund, the general fund, and the credit fund.\nThe basic fund will use contributions from AfCFTA member states as well as grants and technical assistance to offset the loss of customs revenue that would result from the implementation of the continental free trade agreement.\nThe general fund will finance the development of infrastructures facilitating trade, while the credit fund will be used to mobilize commercial financing to help the public and private sectors to take advantage of the opportunities created by the Zone and to adapt to the resulting changes.\nTelecel Global Services, a subsidiary of the Mauritius-based Telecel group, provides wholesale voice communication and SMS services as well as enterprise connectivity solutions to more than 250 telecommunications operators, primarily in Africa.\nThe new fund aims to help bridge Africa's digital divide through increased connectivity and digital inclusion. This will contribute to reducing trade barriers, promoting cross-border productivity, and accelerating inclusive industrialization.\n\"This transaction demonstrates how the AfCFTA Adjustment Fund is beginning to achieve its initial objective, namely: to support member states and the private sector in our efforts to give this agreement a significant commercial dimension,\" said the AfCFTA Secretary-General, Wamkele Mene, quoted in the statement. \"By investing in digital infrastructure, we are addressing some of the most critical factors for trade facilitation, industrialization, and the development of regional value chains,\" he added.\nThis article was initially published in French by Walid Kéfi\nEdited in English by Ola Schad Akinocho\n• Global coffee consumption projected to hit a record 169.4 million 60-kg bags in 2025/2026, up from...\n• Investors seem to keep focusing on yields, which are high for the moment• New Leadership might see...\n• Algeria grants commercial 5G licenses to top three telecom operators: Mobilis, Djezzy, and Ooredoo...\n• ECOWAS Bank funds 47.7-km stretch of strategic 700-km road project• Lagos-Calabar highway seen boo...\n• IFC teams up with AfDB and Nigeria’s EbonyLife to assess a new fund for African cinema• Sector cou...\n• Nigerian household debt reached a record \\.7 billion in April 2025, 20.4% of GDP, surpassing corporate debt• Inflation (23%) and low incomes are...\n• Nigerian Clarion Shipping West Africa Limited debuts vessel aimed to service the cabotage market in the country, and potentially beyond. • The move...\n• Kamoa-Kakula, DRC's largest copper mine, boosts production by 31% to 245,127 tonnes in H1 2025, despite a temporary halt in operations in...\n• The IMF has approved an immediate disbursement of $367 million to Ghana, bringing the total financial support provided to the country since May...\nLocated about 40 kilometers from Cape Town’s city center, Boulders Beach in Simon’s Town is one of the Cape Peninsula’s most iconic destinations.

        "NNDC collaborates with Turkish firm to revive Kaduna Textile, invest $15m - QUICK NEWS AFRICA. The New Nigeria Development Company (NNDC) says it will invest 15 million dollars through a partnership with a Turkish firm to reactivate the collapsed Kaduna Textile company.\nThe Group Managing Director, Dr. Ahmed Musa, said this to newsmen shortly after a closed-door meeting with the Turkish business delegation at the NNDC’s head office in Kaduna.\nThe delegation had earlier inspected the site of the firm and the Defence Industries Corporation of Nigeria, both at the Kakuri Industrial Layout in Kaduna.\nVoice of Nigeria reports that the GMD said the NNDC and the Turkish firm, Sur International Textile, would invest the amount in revitalising the Kaduna Textile.\nAccording to the proposal, the Turkish firm will provide 35 per cent of the amount, the Federal Government 45 per cent and KTL will give 20 per cent of the funds.\nMusa said in a short term, the KTL would produce uniform needs for the Nigerian Armed Forces as well as the Police and other paramilitary agencies in the country, and across the West Africa subregion.\nHe said revamping the KTL would boost the economy of Kaduna state and create employment opportunities to the unemployed youths within and outside the state.\n“We held a private meeting with a team of delegation from Turkey. They want to invest in Kaduna Textile and turn it around.\n“In summary, they want to start producing military and paramilitary uniforms for members of the Nigerian Armed Forces.” Musa said.\nAccording to him, the project is a big and laudable one that will boost the economy of Kaduna State by increasing its revenue drive and create massive employment.\n“We have been able to attract investors into the state.” he added.\nThe NNDC’s Executive Director, Investments, Alhaji Abdullahi Ali-Gombe, said the agreement would revamp the collapsed Textile firm, owned by the 19 Northern States.\nBesides boosting the ailing economy, Ali-Gombe explained that when operational, the firm would essentially go into production of military and paramilitary garments.\nAli-Gombe, who is also the Chairman, Restructuring Committee of the KTL, said “we can not say tentatively when this will take off. We are hoping very soon”.\nThe Kaduna Textile Limited, established in 1957, operated a large integrated textile mill, producing various kinds of garments.\nThe company, currently in a state of comatose, started operation in November 1957, spinning country’s cotton and later in January 1958, went into full production of unbleached grey bafts.\nIn 1961, it began the production of finished garments.\nThe firm was financed by the Northern Nigeria regional Marketing Board and the region’s development corporation and was managed by an expatriate firm, David Whitehead & Sons.\nIt was closed down in 2000 following various financial crises and inadequate power supply."

Asian shares are mostly up after US stocks inch to more records as inflation slows\nWorld shares are mostly higher, buoyed by gains of tech-related stocks after Wall Street inched to more records following a surprisingly encouraging report on inflation and a stunning forecast for growth from Oracle because of the AI boom\nMANILA, Philippines -- World shares were mostly higher Thursday, buoyed by gains of tech-related stocks after Wall Street inched to more records following a surprisingly encouraging report on inflation and a stunning forecast for growth from Oracle because of the artificial intelligence boom.\nIn early European trading, Germany's DAX was nearly flat at 23,631.29. Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.4% to 9,259.17, while France's CAC 40 climbed 0.5% to 7,803.52.\nIn Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 added 1.2% to 44,372.50, with tech investment company SoftBank Group’s shares jumping 8.3% in a second straight day of gains.\nData released Thursday showed Japan’s producer prices rose 2.7% year-on-year in August from a 2.5% rise the previous month, in line with market expectations. The higher cost of food, transport equipment and machinery contributed to the rise in prices.\nIn Chinese markets, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index slid 0.4% to 26,086.32 while the Shanghai Composite index rose 1.7% to 3,875.31.\nShares of chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp added more than 6%, while Hua Hong Semiconductor rose 3.8%. Cambricon Technologies, often called China’s Nvidia, climbed 9%.\nSouth Korea's Kospi climbed 0.9% to 3,344.20 while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was down 0.3% to 8,805.00. India's BSE Sensex added nearly 0.2% while Taiwan's Taiex rose 0.1%, trimming earlier gains.\nThe future for the S&P 500 rose 0.1% while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average added less than 0.1%.\n“Asia’s Thursday tape was the kind of market that looks lively from a distance but flat when you press your nose against the glass. After Wall Street’s record sprint, traders in Tokyo and Seoul tried to carry the baton. Still, Hong Kong and Sydney promptly fumbled it, leaving the MSCI Asia-Pacific index pacing on the spot after five straight daily advances,” Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a market commentary.\nOn Wall Street, the S&P 500 rose 0.3% on Wednesday and set an all-time high for a second straight day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 220 points, or 0.5%, and the Nasdaq composite edged up by less than 0.1% after both set records the day before.\nStocks have hit records in large part because Wall Street is expecting the economy to pull off a delicate balancing act: slowing enough to convince the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, but not so much that it causes a recession, all while inflation remains under control.\nPopular Reads\nMany things must go right for that to happen, and an encouraging signal came from a report Wednesday saying inflation at the U.S. wholesale level unexpectedly slowed in August.\nA potentially more important report is coming Thursday, which will show how bad inflation has been for U.S. households.\nTraders were already convinced the Fed will deliver its first cut to interest rates of the year at its next meeting, but they need inflation data until then to be mild enough not to derail those expectations.\nOn Wall Street, tech stocks led the way after Oracle said AI-related demand is set to send its revenue surging. Oracle stock leaped 35.9% for its best day since 1992, even though it also reported results for the latest quarter that came up just shy of analysts’ expectations.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which makes chips used in AI and other computing, saw its stock that trades in the U.S. climb 3.8% after it said its revenue jumped nearly 34% in August from a year earlier.\nOn the losing side of Wall Street was Apple, whose drop of 3.2% helped drag the Dow lower and was the heaviest single weight on the S&P 500. Some analysts said its unveiling of new iPhones the day before contained no surprises and may not drive much growth in demand.\nIn other dealings Thursday, benchmark U.S. crude shed 11 cents to $63.56 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 8 cents to $67.41 per barrel.\nThe U.S. dollar rose to 147.88 yen from 147.36 yen.

The Nasdaq composite rose 0.4% to 22,755.16.\n“Markets once again proved that they love nothing more than turning a crisis into a stage set for higher prices,” Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary.\nEmployers outside the government actually cut 32,000 more jobs than they added in September, according to the survey by ADP Research, with the Midwest particularly hard hit. The survey also revised down its numbers for employment in August, to a loss of 3,000 jobs from a previously reported gain of 54,000.\nUsually, traders on Wall Street wait for a more comprehensive U.S. government jobs report to suss out how the job market is doing. The U.S. government gets its data from a larger sample of employers than the ADP survey.\nBut the next Labor Department report, scheduled for Friday, is likely to be delayed because of the shutdown of the U.S. government that began just after midnight.\nThe hope on Wall Street has been that the job market will continue to slow just enough to convince the Federal Reserve to keep cutting interest rates, but not by so much that it brings a recession.\nThat’s a delicate balance to achieve, and every economic report from the U.S. government that gets delayed only increases the uncertainty about whether it’s possible. Stocks have already run to records on expectations for coming cuts to rates, so a lack of them could send the market lower.\nIn other dealings on Thursday, U.S. benchmark crude oil shed 11 cents to $61.67 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, edged down 11 cents to $65.24 per barrel.\nThe U.S. dollar fell to 146.69 Japanese yen from 147.08 yen. The euro rose to $1.1761 from $1.1731.\nThe price of gold seesawed between gains and losses after surging to fresh highs. As of Thursday, it was up $3.20 at $3,900.70 per ounce. The precious metal, often used as a safe haven for investments in times of uncertainty, has been steadily climbing for months, gaining more than 37% in the past year.\n___\nAP Business Writers Stan Choe and Matt Ott contributed.\nSponsored Content by Taboola\nPopular Reads\nABC News Live\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",
        "Asian shares retreat after Intel helped drive Wall Street to more records. Asian shares retreat after Intel helped drive Wall Street to more records\nAsian shares mostly retreat after a rally of technology stocks led by Nvidia and Intel pushed Wall Street to more records\nMANILA, Philippines -- Asian shares mostly retreated Friday after a rally of technology stocks led by Nvidia and Intel pushed Wall Street to more records.\nJapan's Nikkei 225 switched from gains to losses and was down nearly 1.4% to 44,667.88 as of early afternoon, after the Bank of Japan decided to keep its benchmark short-term interest rate unchanged at 0.5%. Data released Friday also showed the country's annual inflation in August slowed to a 10-month low at 2.7%, from 3.1% the previous month.\nIn Chinese markets, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index added 0.1% to 26,576.59 while the Shanghai Composite index was down less than 0.1% to 3,830.65. Investors are awaiting a phone call later Friday between President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping on tariffs and finalizing a deal to allow TikTok to keep operating in the United States.\nAustralia’s S&P/ASX 200 climbed 0.6% to 8,799.80 after losses a day earlier, when data indicated the jobs market was showing signs of softness.\nSouth Korea' Kospi fell 0.7% to 3,436.48. India's BSE Sensex edged down 0.4%, trimming earlier gains. Taiwan's Taiex dipped 0.4%.\nWall Street rolled to more records Thursday as Nvidia and Intel led a rally for technology stocks on the announcement of their deal that includes a $5 billion investment.\nThe S&P 500 rose 0.5% and is on track for a third straight winning week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 124 points, or 0.3%, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.9%. All three set all-time highs.\nIntel soared 22.8% for its best day since 1987 after Nvidia said it would buy $5 billion of the chipmaker’s stock. It’s part of a collaboration where the pair will develop products for data centers and personal computers. Nvidia climbed 3.5% and was by far the strongest force lifting the S&P 500 because it’s Wall Street’s most valuable company.\nEncouraging reports on the economy sent Treasury yields climbing in the bond market, meanwhile, including one that said fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week than expected.\nThat could indicate the pace of layoffs is slowing, and it was a relief after the prior week’s data showed a disconcerting leap to a four-year high. The job market has slowed so much that the Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut its main interest rate for the first time this year in order to give it some help.\nThe Fed also indicated more cuts may be on the way, though Chair Jerome Powell warned that the Fed is in a precarious position and may have to change course quickly. That’s because the economy is in an unusual situation where the job market is slowing while inflation is remaining stubbornly high at the same time.\nThe Fed is in charge of fixing both, but it has only one tool to do so. And helping one by moving interest rates often hurts the other in the short term.\nExpectations are high on Wall Street that the Fed will keep cutting interest rates, and an unexpected halt could send stocks tumbling. Critics say stock prices have already shot too high and become too expensive, in part because of heavy bets on continued cuts in rates.\nOn Wall Street, smaller stocks led the way. They can be some of the biggest beneficiaries of easier interest rates, and the Russell 2000 index of small stocks rallied 2.5% to join its bigger rivals in setting all-time highs. It topped its prior record, which was set in 2021.\nIn other dealings on Friday, benchmark U.S. crude lost 19 cents to $63.38 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, shed 11 cents to $66.81 per barrel.\nThe U.S. dollar slid to 147.38 yen from 147.92 yen.

        "Former Meta employees say they saw child abuse in VR before the company blocked research. Two former Meta employees alleged in sworn congressional testimony Tuesday that the company’s virtual reality products have exposed children to adult content such as nudity, sexual propositions and live masturbation.\nThe former employees, Jason Sattizahn and Cayce Savage, worked as researchers who specialized in studying the welfare of underage users of Meta VR products. They told members of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law that Meta disregarded their findings, censored their attempts to do further research and, in at least one instance, deleted evidence of a youth’s being sexually harassed.\nTheir testimony added to years of controversy around CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s company and how minors are treated on his social media platforms, including Facebook and Instagram. Spurred by testimony from earlier whistleblowers and by news reports, lawmakers, class action lawyers and state attorneys general have been pushing for changes at Meta, as well as compensation for those who say they’ve been hurt.\nSattizahn and Savage both worked in various departments at Meta over several years before they focused on the topic of minors and virtual reality. Meta has poured billions of dollars into developing virtual reality spaces and the headsets used to access them, but the two former employees said Meta has not devoted sufficient resources to online safety.\n“Meta is aware that children are being harmed in VR,” Savage testified at the hearing.\n“I quickly became aware,” she said, “that it is not uncommon for children in VR to experience bullying, sexual assault, to be solicited for nude photographs and sexual acts by pedophiles, and to be regularly exposed to mature content like gambling and violence, and to participate in adult experiences like strip clubs and watching pornography with strangers.”\nSavage, who said she left Meta in 2023, said she was stymied when she wanted to find out how common the problems were.\n“I wish I could tell you the percentage of children in VR experiencing these harms, but Meta would not allow me to conduct this research,” she said.\nSattizahn said that, according to his observations, some adults use Meta’s virtual reality products during masturbation in situations in which minors can hear.\n“The audio that’s transmitted isn’t just solicitation,” he said. “There will also be instances — that we have seen — where you can hear people sexually pleasuring themselves, transmitted over audio in a spatial sense, as you are being surrounded and brigaded and being harassed.”\nSattizahn said Meta fired him last year after he complained internally about limits on his research.\nMeta disputed aspects of their testimony, saying they were being selective in talking about it.\n“The claims at the heart of this hearing are nonsense; they’re based on selectively leaked internal documents that were picked specifically to craft a false narrative,” Meta spokesperson Andy Stone said in a statement.\nStone denied the allegations of internal censorship at the company, saying “there was never any blanket prohibition on conducting research with young people.” He said that, since 2022, Meta had conducted “about three dozen studies on social issues related to young people and hundreds more on other youth-related matters.”\nZuckerberg has embraced virtual reality as part of Meta’s future — even rebranding his corporate umbrella from Facebook to Meta in 2021 in a nod to the metaverse. He has also invested billions of dollars into the development of VR headsets, eyeglasses and software since 2014, when he acquired VR headset maker Oculus for $2 billion.\nBut there have been long-standing concerns about the safety of kids who use virtual reality. Experts have documented various examples of sexual content, racism and abuse that affect children in the metaverse.\nA 1998 federal law, known as the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, makes it difficult for internet companies to collect data about children younger than 13. But Sattizahn and Savage said that many children under 13 use Meta’s apps and that the company does not try hard to stop them in order to keep its user metrics high.\n“Children drive profits,” Sattizahn said in an interview after Tuesday’s hearing. “If Meta invests more in safety to get kids off of them, engagement goes down, monetization goes down, ad revenue goes down. They need them.”\nHe said that he tells his own family not to use Meta apps and that he did so even while he was an employee.\nSome of the allegations were first reported Monday by The Washington Post. The newspaper said four current and former Meta staffers went to Congress as a group this year to describe what they saw as corporate wrongs and provide internal documents.\nSattizahn and Savage are the latest in a long line of Meta and Facebook former employees to testify before Congress as whistleblowers, criticizing the company where they previously worked. The former employees include Frances Haugen, who testified in 2021 after having released internal documents about teens’ suicidal thoughts and other subjects, and Sarah Wynn-Williams, who testified this year after she wrote a bestselling book about Facebook’s internal culture and its impact on democracy.\nSattizahn testified Tuesday that, in the wake of earlier allegations, Meta has focused on damage control.\n“Meta’s immediate response to congressional concern was not to do the right thing but rather roll out new processes and policies to manipulate control and erase data,” he said. “We researchers were directed how to write reports to limit risk to Meta. Internal work groups were locked down, making it nearly impossible to share data and coordinate between teams to keep users safe.”\nHe told the senators that when his team “uncovered that underage children using Meta VR in Germany were subject to demands for sex acts, nude photos and other acts that no child should ever be exposed to, Meta demanded that we erase any evidence of such dangers that we saw.”\nStone, from Meta, said that U.S. and European privacy regulations govern how the company handles data about younger children.\n“Global privacy regulations make clear that if information from minors under 13 years of age is collected without verifiable parental or guardian consent, it has to be deleted,” he said.\nRepublican and Democratic lawmakers said they had lost patience with Meta and Zuckerberg.\nThe two witnesses, Sattizahn and Savage, “were hired to purportedly make the platform safer for children, but what they found was a company that knew their products were unsafe and they just did not care,” said Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., chair of the subcommittee.\nSen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said Meta “blocked, manipulated, hid and deleted research that showed that its virtual reality products were frequently used by underage kids who were exposed to real and significant harm.”\nSeveral senators said they wanted to see Congress pass legislation this year to try to hold tech companies accountable. Last year, the Senate passed a pair of bills aimed at protecting children online — including one that would have imposed a “duty of care” on internet companies — but those proposals stalled in the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said they implicated free speech.\nSen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who is running a separate investigation into how teens have used Meta’s artificial intelligence chatbots, said at Tuesday’s hearing that he wants Americans to be able to sue tech companies more easily for alleged damages.\n“We need to open the courtroom doors and allow victims to have their day in court,” he said.\nIn her testimony, Savage said most parents are not informed about the potential harm in virtual reality.\n“A lot of parents in my research indicated that they weren’t aware that their children were interacting with strangers,” she said.",
        "Hawley pushes legal action against Meta after whistleblowers detail child abuse in VR. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., called to \"open the courtroom doors\" so parents can sue Meta, accusing founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg of misleading Congress after whistleblowers detailed child safety failures on the company’s virtual reality (VR) platforms.\nTwo former Meta researchers told a Senate panel Tuesday that the company buried child harm evidence in VR, killed age-verification studies and let AI chatbots flirt with kids, prompting a bipartisan push to pass measures protecting minors online.\n\"The claims at the heart of this hearing are nonsense; they’re based on selectively leaked internal documents that were picked specifically to craft a false narrative,\" a Meta spokesperson said.\n\"The truth is there was never any blanket prohibition on conducting research with young people and, since the start of 2022, Meta approved nearly 180 Reality Labs-related studies on issues including youth safety and well-being.\"\nMARK ZUCKERBERG SUES META OVER FACEBOOK SUSPENSIONS — BUT NOT THE ONE YOU THINK\nTestifying before the Senate were Cayce Savage and Jason Sattizahn, both former Meta researchers.\nSattizahn alleged Meta routinely prioritized engagement and profit over safety — especially for kids — and manipulated or erased research showing harm.\nHe said despite attempts to curb data collection, the studies researchers could run still showed the company’s products endangered users.\nGermany once banned Meta’s VR sales over data treatment concerns; after sales resumed in 2022, Sattizahn was sent to conduct research there.\nMETA AI DOCS EXPOSED, ALLOWING CHATBOTS TO FLIRT WITH KIDS\nHe said he understood Meta was trying to show its VR headsets were safe for Germans.\nBut when research uncovered that underage children using Meta VR in Germany were subjected to demands for sex acts, nude photos and other acts children should never be exposed to, Sattizahn alleged Meta demanded all evidence be erased.\n\"My research still revealed emotional and psychological damage, particularly to women who were sexually solicited, molested or worse,\" he testified. \"In response, Meta demanded I change my research in the future to not gather this data on emotional and psychological harm.\"\nSavage testified she led youth safety research in VR and likewise said Meta prioritized engagement over child safety.\nHAWLEY OPENS PROBE INTO META AFTER REPORTS OF AI ROMANTIC EXCHANGES WITH MINORS\nShe said the company employed suppression tactics, including editing reports, demanding deletions and threatening jobs.\nHawley asked Savage why it was important for Meta to have children under 13 using VR. She told him kids drive household adoption of gaming devices, which means more money for Meta.\n\"So, this is about profits at the end of the day,\" Hawley told Savage while seeking clarification on whether Meta will do anything for a profit, including exposing children to vile sexual abuse.\n\"When I was doing research to identify the harms that children were facing in VR, which I had to be sneaky about because legal wouldn't actually let me do it, I identified that Roblox, the app on in VR, was being used by coordinated pedophile rings,\" Savage said. \"They set up strip clubs, and they paid children to strip.\"\nShe added that Robux could be converted into real money.\nLOUISIANA SUES ONLINE GAMING PLATFORM ROBLOX FOR ALLEGEDLY ENABLING CHILD PREDATORS\nSavage said she flagged the issue to Meta, saying under no circumstances should Meta host the Roblox app on the headset.\n\"You can now download it in their app store,\" she said.\nLater, under questioning, Savage told the panel she estimates any child in a social VR space will come in contact with, or be directly exposed to, something inappropriate.\n\"She said every single child who goes into the platform will 100% be exposed to child sex abuse material. Every single one,\" Hawley told Fox News Digital Tuesday evening. \"I just come back to the fact that we have got to protect our children.\n\"It can't be that if you go online as a kid, you are 100% likely to be sexually abused, and that's what the witnesses said today. If you are online, if you're on their virtual reality program platform rather, you are going to get sexually abused. That was their testimony.\"\nHawley called out Zuckerberg for testifying on Jan. 31, 2024, that Meta does not allow people under the age of 13 on the service.\nI LOST MY 16-YEAR-OLD SON TO SUICIDE FROM ADDICTIVE AI ALGORITHMS. WE CAN'T LET BIG TECH DESTROY OUR CHILDREN\nDuring his testimony last year, the CEO said anyone under the age of 13 will be removed from the service, and, in response to another question, Zuckerberg said Meta does not want users under the age of 13.\nHawley said Zuckerberg misled Americans with that testimony, pointing to whistleblowers who said under-13 users are rampant on the platform.\n\"I don't see how you can square what he told us under oath last year with what these whistleblowers said today,\" Hawley told Fox News Digital. \"But that's true of a lot of his statements. I mean, he said over and over, whether it's the safety protocols Facebook has put into place, that's not true.\n\"Whether it's regarding their work in China, he said, 'Oh, we don't do work in China.' That is not true. He said, 'We don't have any contacts with the Chinese government.' That's not true. So, I mean, we're really piling up a long list here.\"\nHawley said he has called for Zuckerberg to testify again under oath, though he’s heard Meta isn’t interested.\nUltimately, Hawley said, it was time to \"open the courtroom doors\" so victims and families can sue Meta for failing to protect children.\n\"It is abundantly clear to me that it is time to allow parents and victims to sue this company,\" he said. \"They have got to be able to get into court and to get in front of a jury and hold this company accountable, and that begins with Mark Zuckerberg. There has to be accountability. We have to open the courtroom doors and allow victims to have their day in court.\"\nEarlier this year, Hawley said he advanced legislation through the Judiciary Committee that would allow victims of child sex abuse online to sue Facebook or any Big Tech company where harm happens.\n\"I don’t think we’re going to see real change at these companies until this becomes law and parents and victims can get into court and hold these people accountable,\" he said. \"The bottom line is we've got to protect our kids. I mean, they're making money by stealing the innocence of our children.\"\nMeta told Fox News Digital the company is training its artificial intelligence bots to not respond to teenagers on self-harm, suicide, disorder eating and potentially inappropriate romantic conversations, regardless of content. The company is also working to limit teen access to a select group of AI characters, \"for now.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nSen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., closed the meeting by inviting anyone from Meta to testify or challenge what was said.\n\"I think that they see there is truly bipartisan anger, not only with Meta, but with these other social media platforms and virtual reality platforms and chatbots that are intentionally, knowingly harming our children,\" she said. \"This has got to stop. Enough is enough.\"",
        "Meta covered up potential child harms, whistleblowers claim. Meta covered up potential child harms, whistleblowers claim\nTwo former Meta safety researchers told a US Senate committee on Tuesday that the social media giant covered up potential harms to children stemming from its virtual reality (VR) products.\n\"Meta has chosen to ignore the problems they created and bury evidence of users' negative experiences,\" said Jason Sattizahn.\nThe hearing comes a day after the Washington Post reported the whistleblowers' allegations that Meta lawyers intervened to shape internal research that could have flagged risks.\nMeta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, denies the allegations and in a statement referred to the \"claims at the heart\" of the hearing as \"nonsense.\"\nMr Sattizahn and Cayce Savage, who once lead research on the youth user experience for Meta's VR platforms, told senators that the company demanded researchers erase evidence of sexual abuse risk on those products.\nThey also alleged the company told in-house researchers to avoid work that could produce evidence of harm from its VR products to children.\nAhead of the hearing, Meta knocked back the allegations.\nThe claims, the company said, are \"based on selectively leaked internal documents that were picked specifically to craft a false narrative.\"\nThere were also no bans or limits on carrying out research, a spokesperson added – saying the company has in recent years approved \"nearly 180 Reality Labs-related studies on issues including youth safety and well-being.\"\nMr Sattizahn, who worked at the company from 2018 to 2024, responded in testimony to the committee by calling Meta's response to the Washington Post report a \"lie by avoidance.\"\n\"It's pointing out some rote number that means nothing,\" he said, insisting that Meta's research is being \"pruned and manipulated.\"\nDuring one exchange with US Senator John Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, Ms Savage alleged that during her research, she identified that Roblox, the online game platform popular among children, was being used by coordinated paedophile rings.\n\"They set up strip clubs and they pay children to strip\" with Robux, the app's currency, which can be converted into real money, Ms Savage said.\n\"I flagged this to Meta and said that under no circumstances should we host the app Roblox on their headset,\" Ms Savage said. Roblox is still available in the Meta VR app store, she noted.\nRoblox told the BBC it strongly disagreed with the allegations made on Tuesday, saying they were \"based on ill-informed and outdated information\".\n\"At Roblox, safety is a top priority,\" a company spokesperson said. \"We work tirelessly to remove violative content and bad actors from the platform through our 24/7 moderation system and respond swiftly to abuse reports, including banning accounts and reporting to law enforcement.\"\nMeta offers parental supervision tools on its Quest headsets, as well as on the VR game, Horizon Worlds. These allow parents and guardians to see and adjust safety features and track which other players their children follow and are followed by.\nBut during the hearing, Republican Senator Ashley Moody of Florida said she was unable to navigate the parental controls despite being one of the first attorneys general in the country to sue Meta in court for allegedly harming children online.\n\"It doesn't surprise you that someone like me who has all this knowledge had to go to my own child and say 'how do I find the parental controls?'\" she asked the former researchers.\n\"Not at all,\" they both responded.\nMr Sattizahn and Ms Savage are just the latest former Meta employees to come forward with explosive allegations about the company.\nIn 2021, Frances Haugen who once worked as a product manager on the company's civic integrity team, said Instagram was impacting the mental health of teenagers but did not share its own findings suggesting that the platform was a \"toxic\" place for many youngsters.\nMs Haugen had copied a trove of internal memos and documents prior to departing the company.\nMeta boss Mark Zuckerberg said that the time that her claims that Meta prioritizes profit above safety are \"just not true\".\nMr Zuckerberg has also faced repeated questioning by US lawmakers who claim that the company pushes harmful content to young users.\nAt a Senate hearing last year, after being prodding by Senator Hawley, Mr Zuckerberg apologised to families who claimed their loved ones had been harmed by the company's products.\nSeveral of them were sitting in the audience behind him.\n\"I'm sorry for everything you have all been though,\" Mr Zuckerberg said.\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

        "Secret audios, dramatic leaks, spying claims: A bribery scandal engulfs Argentina's Milei. Secret audios, dramatic leaks, spying claims: A bribery scandal engulfs Argentina's Milei\nArgentines have been captivated by a growing corruption scandal involving President Javier Milei's close associates\nBUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- Argentines are so used to the corruption in their political system that even Peronists — supporters of the populist movement that dominated Argentina’s politics for decades — employ a fatalistic maxim to describe their politicians: “Roban, pero hacen,” or, “They steal, but they get it done.”\nBut for the past two weeks, Argentines have been riveted by a ballooning graft scandal drawing in close associates of libertarian President Javier Milei, the wild-haired economist who won Argentina's 2023 election in part by campaigning as an outsider against the corrupt, Peronist-dominated elite — “the caste,” he calls it — whose unbridled spending helped precipitate Argentina’s economic crisis.\nAt a time of extreme fiscal austerity, the allegations that his powerful sister and chief of staff, Karina Milei, profited from a kickback scheme in Argentina’s disability agency have exploded onto the headlines here, threatening to sully the government’s reputation ahead of national midterms at the end of October. Milei denies the allegations.\n“It appears to be very similar to many other corruption scandals in Argentina, and taints his image as being completely different, of not being part of ‘the caste,’” said Eugenia Mitchelstein, the chair of the social sciences department at Buenos Aires’ San Andrés University.\nThe scandal broke out last month when local streaming channel Carnaval published secretly recorded audio clips purporting to show Diego Spagnuolo, then-director of the National Disability Agency, describe a scheme of kickbacks from drug distributor Suizo Argentina.\nThe alleged voice of Spagnuolo claims that top officials — including Milei's sister Karina and her senior aide, Eduardo “Lule” Menem — accepted bribes of $500,000 and $800,000 in exchange for government pharmaceutical contracts. The voice says Karina Milei takes kickbacks of 3-4% of the contract price.\n“I told him, ‘Javier, you know they’re stealing, that your sister is stealing,’” the alleged Spagnuolo can be heard saying.\nIt's not clear who captured the audio or when. Based on references to political events in the recordings, local media have reported that the conversations occurred over several months starting in August 2024.\nThe leak appeared timed to have maximum impact, rocking Milei's government before Sunday’s provincial elections in Buenos Aires, the country’s most populous province and a historic Peronist opposition stronghold.\nThe audio also surfaced soon after Milei vetoed an increase in benefits for people with disabilities, arguing it would jeopardize his much-vaunted fiscal surplus.\n“Corruption scandals at times of economic scarcity tend to have a bigger impact,\" said Ana Iparraguirre, an Argentine political analyst and partner at Washington-based strategy firm GBAO. “It's hitting hard at Milei's potential to grow beyond his base.”\nThe typically voluble Milei kept silent about the recordings for six days after their release.\nWithin hours of the leak, he sacked Spagnuolo, who was also his personal lawyer. A federal judge ordered raids at offices and homes belonging to Spagnuolo and Suizo Argentina executives.\nUnder pressure, Milei’s officials contested the veracity of the recordings and accused the political opposition of orchestrating the scandal to undermine the government's electoral prospects.\nPeppered with questions at a campaign caravan last Wednesday, Milei snapped, saying, “Everything (Spagnuolo) says is a lie.” The rally devolved into chaos as protesters threw stones at his motorcade.\nThe next day Mieli offered a full-throated defense of his sister, condemning all the allegations as political theater.\nJust as Milei seemed to reclaim control of the narrative, recordings emerged of Karina Milei speaking to officials inside her private office at the Casa Rosada presidential palace.\nThe same journalist at Carnaval who released the Spagnuolo recordings published two brief and innocuous audio clips — one in which Karina Milei can be heard urging colleagues to “stay united” and another in which she complains of working from 8 a.m. until 11 p.m. each day.\nThe journalist, Mauro Federico, claimed he had 50 minutes of recordings that he was prepared to release, prompting full-fledged panic in the presidency.\nManuel Adorni, Milei's spokesperson, said the conversations were “illegally recorded” and denounced the leak as “an illegal intelligence operation intended to destabilize the country.\"\nPolice raided Carnaval offices and the homes of several journalists, including Federico's, seizing laptops, cellphones and hard drives. A federal judge barred media outlets from publishing any recordings made inside Casa Rosada in response to a criminal complaint by the Ministry of Security.\nPress freedom groups were up in arms, with Paris-based watchdog Reporters Without Borders calling the court order “one of the most serious threats to press freedom in the country since the return of democracy.”\nThe leak even briefly spiraled into a diplomatic incident after the government in its complaint suggested the possible involvement of Russian spies, citing past examples of Russian expats in Argentina “conducting actions to influence the population for Russia’s geopolitical interests.\"\nThe Russian Embassy was not pleased. “The desire to see ‘Russian spies’ around every corner is irrational and destructive,\" it said.\nAnalysts say a key factor limiting Milei’s ability to quash the scandal is the involvement Karina Milei, his sister and close confidant since childhood who now acts as his gatekeeper. The president has compared her to Moses and regularly refers to her as “El Jefe,” the Spanish masculine form for “the boss.\"\nA former Instagram cake-baker and tarot card reader, Karina Milei successfully managed her unmarried brother’s presidential campaign before becoming general secretary — a catch-all title under which she controls the president’s agenda, chooses staff for top government roles and essentially runs his libertarian political party.\nIt's not the first time that she has been mired in scandal. Milei's reputation took a hit earlier this year after he promoted a memecoin called Libra that crashed hours later, saddling investors with over $250 million in losses.\nThe coin's creator bragged in text messages that he was paying Karina Milei to advance his crypto-ambitions. Milei and his sister have denied any wrongdoing. Class-action lawsuits filed by investors are crawling through U.S. courts.\nAs fallout from the audio scandal spreads, Karina Milei has increasingly become the target of public outrage — evacuated from two consecutive campaign events in Buenos Aires last week.\nA catchy jingle — first sung on a popular streaming channel to the tune of “Guantanamera” — has gone viral, belted out at Buenos Aires nightclubs in recent days.\n“Big bribe-taker, Karina is a big bribe-taker,\" the chorus goes.\nMonica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the saga revealed Karina Milei to be the president’s “Achilles’ heel.”\n“Pragmatism here would require him to remove Karina,” she said. \"This is where you see why certain actions like nepotism don’t serve you very well at the end of the day.”\nSponsored Content by Taboola\nPopular Reads\nJapan's Prince Hisahito is the first male royal to reach adulthood in 40 years.

        "Task orders and bottlenecks: how the largest US shipbuilder is putting AI to work. Task orders and bottlenecks: how the largest US shipbuilder is putting AI to work\nHII thinks AI will speed up production in several ways.\nNATIONAL HARBOR, Md.—Within just a few months, the country’s largest military shipbuilder aims to have its shipyard employees taking direction from AI.\n“By the end of this year, our plan is to have every single person in our manufacturing shops—17 different businesses, basically across 550 acres—doing work based on the output of what AI tells us to go do. At the end of [2026] all of the people working on all of our ships will be directed by what AI tells us to do,” Brian Fields, the chief technology officer for HII’s Newport News Shipbuilding division, said at C3 AI’s federal event on Tuesday. “So we're jumping in the deep end of the pool… If we don't do something rapidly, we are not going to supply the Navy with the ships they need.”\nHII, which has been leaning into emerging technologies, inked a deal with C3 AI earlier this year to use agentic AI, which uses automation to learn and make decisions once given specific goals, to help the shipbuilder meet its goals of a 20-percent increase in production.\n“We have 17 different shops: 2,300 people. They have to do 5,200 jobs a week, and each one of those jobs has 32 different data sources. So you're talking hundreds of thousands of decisions…to be made by about 100 people in spreadsheets. The results you have are really built on the process you have. And we need a new process,” Fields said.\nThe push for using AI in shipbuilding comes as the White House and Navy leaders demand faster production times for nuclear-capable submarines.\nStephen Ehikian, C3 AI’s new CEO, said the company’s platform creates a kind of “digital twin” of the shipbuilding process and can run “virtual simulations,” including scenario planning and risk assessment.\n“We showed agentic process automation, workflow automation, as well as ability to build actual applications,” Ehikian, who was most recently the acting and deputy administrator for the General Services Administration, told reporters. “The whole market is moving towards seeing actual outcomes. The applications are the most valuable piece of this.”\nNewport News plans to use AI to pinpoint production chokepoints in submarine production.\n“If all you're doing is moving data around to try to keep the systems working, I'd much rather automate that, because we got way too many people that are in that side of the business, and I'd rather have them helping us build ships more efficiently,” Fields told reporters.\n“The thing that keeps us from building submarines at the pace that they need to be built right now comes down to 17 parts. Seventeen parts drive an enormous increase in submarine build, and those 17 parts come from a foundry that isn't able to get us the parts to put one piece of complex equipment together. So we're in the midst right now of using that data and aggressively working with the Navy to go print those parts and radically change how we deliver submarine builds.”\nThe goal is for AI to pull information from disparate sources including spreadsheets, analytics, accounting and scheduling systems. That analysis will in turn—and over time—help shipbuilders “make the right stuff in the right order to give the ship assembly teams the best chance to deliver the ships on time. And that's a long process,” Fields said.\nAnd there’s also the challenge of getting the workforce to trust and use the tools.\n“When you get down into our shops, there's a lot of pride about how they do their work,” Fields said during the event. “One of our work streams is process and behaviors, and we've put some strong leaders in that to really drive the leadership in those shops to say, ‘We own this; we're going to get the value out of it.’”",
        "AI training unicorn Snorkel AI just laid off 13% of its workforce. Snorkel AI, a $1.3 billion Silicon Valley unicorn, cut 31 of 240 employees on Wednesday.\n-\nThe cuts affected software engineers the hardest, while most AI-focused roles were spared.\n-\nSnorkel AI told Business Insider it's \"deprioritizing some legacy areas of our business.\"\n-\nSnorkel AI, a $1.3 billion startup spun out of Stanford that connects artificial intelligence companies to human \"experts,\" laid off about 13% of its employees this week, it confirmed to Business Insider.\nSnorkel AI is part of a boom in startups like Scale AI that help tech companies train their latest AI models, thanks in large part to human gig workers. Based in Silicon Valley, Snorkel announced it raised a $100 million Series D round this May at a $1.3 billion valuation and touts partners like Google and Anthropic on its website.\n31 out of 240 employees were cut on Wednesday, Snorkel AI told Business Insider.\nThe startup attributed the cuts to a shift toward its \"data-as-a-service\" business, which has meant \"deprioritizing some legacy areas of our business.\"\n\"This, unfortunately, also means saying goodbye to some talented colleagues in these areas,\" Snorkel AI said. \"We are grateful for their contributions and are supporting them through this transition. These changes allow us to focus our energy on the areas where we can have the greatest impact and better serve the evolving needs of our customers.\"\nSnorkel AI publicly launched in 2020, promising to automate away the data labeling process, which can be expensive because it requires so much human labor. As AI labs race to release better models, they need more human expertise to review and refine datasets — a service that Snorkel AI offers.\nThe latest cuts appear to have avoided most AI-focused roles, the documents obtained by Business Insider show.\nSnorkel AI's software engineering team was the hardest hit, with 13 of its employees terminated. In contrast, none of the company's applied AI engineers or research scientists were let go. Overall, of the 25 people with \"AI\" in their job titles at Snorkel AI, only three were let go.\nSome senior-level people were terminated as well, including Snorkel AI's global head of business development and its director of AI solutions engineering.\nIt's the latest major layoff to hit the highly competitive data labeling industry after Scale AI, one of the largest and best-known players, laid off 14% of its workforce and 500 contractors in July.\nScale AI's layoff came after Meta bought 49% of the company and hired its CEO, triggering major customers like Google to leave. In an email explaining the decision, Scale AI blamed overhiring and market forces and also disclosed that it was unprofitable. Earlier this month, Scale AI terminated a dozen contractors on a key team tasked with probing AI models for potential harms.\nHave a tip?

        "Scale AI is being investigated by San Francisco labor regulators. San Francisco regulators are investigating Scale AI's treatment of its workers.\n-\nScale AI depends on thousands of workers, whom it considers contractors, to train top AI models.\n-\nScale AI is cooperating with the probe and complies with all labor laws, it told Business Insider.\n-\nThe city of San Francisco is investigating Scale AI over its labor practices, a Scale AI spokesperson confirmed to Business Insider.\nScale AI, which is based in San Francisco, relies heavily on a vast army of people it considers contractors to train tech companies' latest artificial intelligence models. Meta bought almost half of Scale AI for $14 billion in a blockbuster AI deal this summer.\nThe city's investigation is being led by its Office of Labor Standards Enforcement (OLSE), which oversees sick leave, minimum wage, overtime pay, and other regulations for San Francisco workers.\nScale AI spokesperson Natalia Montalvo told Business Insider that the startup is cooperating with the OLSE to provide the information they need and that Scale AI is fully compliant with local laws and regulations.\nSan Francisco's investigation into Scale AI is limited to city residents who worked for the startup — including remotely — over the last three years, according to a now-deleted notice posted by Maura Prendiville, a compliance officer at the OLSE, in a subreddit for Outlier AI, a gig work platform run by Scale AI.\nWhile the notice didn't specify what types of labor practices the city is investigating, it did mention that investigators are looking to speak to people who worked for Scale AI as \"taskers\" and \"freelancers\" rather than the startup's full-time employees.\nThe investigation's existence doesn't mean Scale AI has broken the law, and the city could find it in favor of Scale AI — or drop its probe altogether.\nThe OLSE declined to answer further questions about the probe, citing its policy of not commenting on ongoing investigations. The agency has the authority to levy fines for labor violations.\nIn the Reddit post, Prendiville specified that San Francisco is seeking to speak to people who worked for Scale AI through Outlier AI and Smart Ecosystem, another Scale AI platform. She also wrote that she seeks to speak with people who worked for Scale AI through HireArt, a third-party hiring agency, and the gig work marketplace Upwork.\nUpwork said it has not been contacted by OLSE.\n\"Worker classification and compliance with labor regulations are ultimately the responsibility of the hiring business,\" an Upwork spokesperson said. \"As a general matter, Upwork does not play a role in those determinations.\"\nMontalvo, the Scale AI spokesperson, said that the feedback the company gets from its contributors is \"overwhelmingly positive.\"\n\"Our dedicated teams work hard to ensure contributors are paid fairly, feel supported, and can access the flexible earning opportunities they value,\" she said.\nIt's not the first time Scale AI has been investigated by labor regulators. It was also the subject of a federal Department of Labor investigation that was dropped this summer, TechCrunch reported.\nSome Scale AI workers have previously alleged that the company illegally underpaid them, denied them benefits like sick leave, and misclassified them as contractors in two lawsuits filed over the past year in San Francisco's superior court.\nMeta declined to comment. HireArt didn't respond to a request for comment.\nHave a tip? Contact this reporter via email at crollet@insider.com or on Signal and WhatsApp at 628-282-2811.

        "STAT+: Pharmalittle: We’re reading about FDA and imported GLP-1 drugs, a race to develop sleep meds, and more. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to another working week. We hope the weekend respite was relaxing and invigorating, because that oh-so familiar routine of deadlines, online meetings, and phone calls has predictably returned. But what can you do? The world, such as it is, continues to spin. So time to give it a nudge in a better direction by brewing cups of stimulation. Our choice today is hazelnut creme, an old standby. Meanwhile, here are a few items of interest to start you on your journey, which we hope is meaningful and productive. Best of luck, and do keep in touch. …\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration is tightening oversight of imports of GLP-1 drug ingredients, used for weight loss and diabetes, amid concerns that many of the items may be adulterated and pose a safety risk, Reuters notes. The move comes as the FDA cracks down on unapproved compounded drugs, which had filled the gap during shortages of patented treatments. Soaring demand for obesity drugs sold by Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly has fueled a booming global market for cheaper, and sometimes even counterfeit versions. The agency said it had previously identified serious concerns with compounded weight loss drugs, including dosing errors, use of unapproved salt forms, and side effects, with some requiring hospitalization. As part of its heightened scrutiny, the FDA sent an import alert authorizing detention without physical examination at U.S. ports. This will allow the agency to seize shipments that appear to be non-compliant with federal requirements, without inspecting them on arrival. Importers must now provide proof of quality and compliance before their goods are released. The FDA evaluated 48 manufacturing sites outside the U.S. and found 21% of them as non-compliant.\nOhio is taking steps to more tightly regulate how some large drug-compounding pharmacies in the state operate, including those making weight loss drug copies, by limiting the amount of medicine they keep on hand, Reuters explains. The move could have implications for online telehealth companies that rely on Ohio-based pharmacies producing copies in specialized doses, including one in the state owned by Hims and Hers. Telehealth companies flourished over the last year when a shortage of Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy and Eli Lilly’s Zepbound allowed them to compound mass quantities, but are now selling what they call individualized doses. Novo and Lilly dispute that their production is legal. The Ohio Board of Pharmacy said a new regulation will target the batches large pharmacies produce in anticipation of prescriptions, limiting them to 250 units of a drug at a time. It applies to those that make sterile injectable drugs, including the popular weight loss drugs.",
        "FDA takes aim at telehealth companies for promoting unofficial weight loss drug dupes. Matthew Perrone, Associated Press\nMatthew Perrone, Associated Press\nLeave your feedback\nWASHINGTON (AP) — For the first time, federal health officials are taking aim at telehealth companies promoting unofficial versions of prescription drugs — including popular weight loss medications — as part of the Trump administration’s crackdown on pharmaceutical advertising.\nThe Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday posted more than 100 letters to various drugmakers and online prescribing companies, including Hims & Hers, which has built a multibillion-dollar business centered around lower-cost versions of blockbuster obesity injections.\nREAD MORE: In the gray world of GLP-1 supplements online, health experts urge caution\nThe FDA warned the company to remove “false and misleading” promotional statements from its website, including language claiming that its customized products contain “the same active ingredient” as FDA-approved drugs Wegovy and Ozempic. The formulations cited by regulators are produced by specialty compounding pharmacies and aren’t reviewed by the FDA.\nSubscribe to our Science Newsletter to explore the\nwide worlds of science, health and technology.\nThank you. Please check your inbox to confirm.\n“Your claims imply that your products are the same as an FDA-approved product when they are not,” states the warning letter, dated Sept. 9.\nHims said Tuesday that it “looks forward to engaging with the FDA.”\nWATCH: Why more doctors are treating children and adolescents with weight loss drugs\n“Our website and our customer-facing materials note that compounded treatments are not approved or evaluated by the FDA,” the company said in a statement.\nIt’s the first FDA attempt to directly police online platforms like Hims, which have long argued they’re not subject to traditional drug advertising rules.\nThe FDA also posted separate warning letters to manufacturers of the so-called GLP-1 drugs, taking issue with a 2024 infomercial featuring Oprah Winfrey. Regulators said the 42-minute TV segment from Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk gave a “misleading impression” about the safety of Zepbound, Wegovy and similar “drugs with multiple serious, potentially life-threatening risks.”\nWATCH: The many ways new weight loss drugs could transform the economy\nHealth Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has long been a critic of the pharmaceutical industry, including GLP-1 drugs, and previously suggested Americans can reverse obesity with diet and exercise alone.\nA memo signed by President Donald Trump last week directed Kennedy and the FDA to ensure that pharmaceutical ads on TV, social media and other websites are “truthful and non-misleading.”\nThe new FDA letters each contain “cease and desist” language. That’s a different approach for the agency, which typically drafts its letters in highly bureaucratic language citing specific FDA regulations.\nREAD MORE: Can you get a COVID shot? Here’s your fall vaccine guide\nHims has been under scrutiny from Washington for some time.\nEarlier this year, a Super Bowl ad from the company touted the benefits of its weight-loss medications but didn’t list any of their side effects or potential harms. FDA rules require advertisements to present a balanced picture of drug risks and benefits.\nMakary singled out the ad in last week’s Journal of the American Medical Association, calling it a “brazen” example of how advertising is “contributing to America’s culture of overreliance on pharmaceuticals for health.”\nREAD MORE: Why new weight loss drugs are out of reach for millions of older Americans\nHims and similar companies initially sold cheap generic versions of drugs for hair loss, erectile dysfunction and other health issues. But booming demand for obesity medications opened the door to selling cheaper copies.\nThe FDA permits so-called compounding, or customized production, when there is a shortage of the official versions of FDA-approved medications.\nFDA recently determined that GLP-1 drugs no longer met the criteria for a shortage. That should have ended the compounding, but there is an exception: The practice is still permitted when a prescription is customized for the patient.\nWATCH: New book by former FDA head explores the science behind GLP-1 weight loss drugs\nHims and other companies have taken to offering “personalized” dosages and formulations for certain patients, arguing they offer extra benefits.\nShares of San Francisco-based Hims & Hers Health Inc. fell more than 6.47% in trading Tuesday.\nThe letters posted Tuesday come from FDA’s drug center.\nA letter posted last week from FDA’s vaccine division took issue with a TV ad for AstraZeneca’s FluMist vaccine, saying the spot’s “background music and visual distractions” detract from information about side effects. The letter was signed by FDA vaccine chief Dr. Vinay Prasad, an ally of Kennedy who recently returned to his job at the agency after briefly being forced to step aside.\nResearchers and consumer advocates have long complained that the upbeat TV images of patients enjoying life with family and friends often overshadow discussions of side effects.\nAdditionally, studies have shown that patients exposed to drug ads are more likely to ask their doctors about the medication, even if they don’t fit the prescribing criteria. The American Medical Association, the nation’s largest physician group, came out in support of a ban in 2015, citing TV advertising’s role in “inflating demand for new and more expensive drugs.”\nStand up for truly independent, trusted news that you can count on!\nSupport Provided By:\nLearn more\nSubscribe to Here’s the Deal, our politics\nnewsletter for analysis you won’t find anywhere else.",
        "STAT+: Pharmalittle: We’re reading about Novo layoffs, a Trump crackdown on DTC drug ads, and more. Hello, everyone, and how are you today? We are doing just fine, thank you, especially since the middle of the week is upon us. After all, we have made it this far, so we are determined to hang on for another couple of days. And why not? The alternatives — at least those we can identify — are not particularly appealing. And what better way to make the time fly than to keep busy. So grab that cup of stimulation and get started. Our flavor today is pumpkin spice. Yes, we are getting a head start on autumn. Now, though, the time has come to get busy. So please grab your own cup and dig in to the items of interest assembled below. We hope you have a smashing day, and please do keep in touch. …\nNovo Nordisk, under new leadership and in need of a boost, plans to trim 9,000 jobs — roughly 11% of its workforce — as it seeks to remake itself for a more competitive obesity drug market, STAT tells us. The cuts are designed to save the company $1.26 billion a year by the end of 2026, and are part of what was described as a broader transformation that will simplify its organization, speed decision making, and push more resources toward building growth in its diabetes and obesity businesses. Roughly 5,000 of the job losses will be in Denmark. Novo has more than 78,000 employees. Citing restructuring costs, Novo lowered its operating profit growth for the year to 4% to 10% at constant exchange rates. The company has lowered its outlook several times this year. Novo has been a leader in the booming GLP-1 market for obesity and diabetes drugs, but also struggled to manufacture enough supply to meet huge demand. More recently, Novo has seen rival Eli Lilly surge ahead with its medicine Zepbound in the U.S. obesity market, and has hit stumbles with its pipeline as it seeks to develop next-generation weight loss drugs.\nPresident Trump directed U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to crack down on misleading direct-to-consumer drug advertisements, STAT notes. At the same time, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it would begin rulemaking to close what the agency called a regulatory “loophole” that allows drug companies to direct patients to an external source instead of listing safety risks in advertisements. The FDA also said it was sending thousands of warning letters to drug companies currently running “deceptive” ads, but did not share which companies. The announcement offered few details on how the government would ensure “transparent” drug advertising going forward. The agency said it will “aggressively deploy its available enforcement tools,” and noted that it is employing AI to review more drug ads. Kennedy has called to ban DTC drug ads entirely, saying they mislead patients and do not improve health. FDA commissioner Marty Makary has also criticized the ads, though he has shied away from saying the agency would ban them. The FDA does not have explicit authority to do this, and major restrictions would face significant legal challenges."

        "Worst Spate of Downgrades Since 2021 Signals Pain. Worst Spate of Downgrades Since 2021 Signals Pain\nCredit rating downgrades are becoming more frequent, the latest sign that companies are starting to perform worse and raising fresh questions about whether corporate debt valuations should be as high as they are.\nIn the second quarter, around $94 billion of high-grade US debt was downgraded, compared with just $78 billion of upgrades, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists. It was the first time since early 2021 that downgrades outpaced upgrades in dollar terms, and more companies are at risk of being demoted later this year as economic uncertainty rises, JPMorgan strategists including Eric Beinstein and Silvi Mantri wrote this week.",
        "Markets digest bank earnings after recent turmoil. Stocks slid Friday after a slate of earnings beats from big banks fueled concerns that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its next two meetings.\nStill, the major indices gained for the week. The Dow rose 400 points, or 1.2%. The S&P 500 gained 0.8% and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.3%.\nJPMorgan Chase on Friday reported first-quarter profit and revenue that crushed expectations, boosted by the Fed’s interest rate hiking campaign. Citigroup, Wells Fargo and PNC Financial also reported strong results.\nCEO Jamie Dimon warned investors in the company’s post-earnings conference call that they should prepare for interest rates to be higher for longer than expected.\nWall Street seems to have taken note. Analysts increased their bets on a quarter-point rate hike at the Fed’s meeting in May and another in June.\nFederal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said Friday that the central bank needs to continue tightening monetary policy, further weighing down markets.\nAustan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said that it’s “definitely” possible the United States enters a mild recession after the tumult in banking last month.\nMeanwhile, retail sales data declined more than expected, suggesting that Americans’ spending power and the US economy are weakening.\nConsumer sentiment held fairly steady in April, even as concerns about a recession linger, according to the University of Michigan’s latest monthly survey.\n“There was too much news to digest this morning, but the key takeaway is that the Fed has room to do more harm,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, said in a note.\nThe Dow slipped 144 points, or 0.4%.\nThe S&P 500 tumbled 0.2%.\nThe Nasdaq Composite sank 0.4%.\nAs stocks settle after the trading day, levels might still change slightly.",
        "Corporate America, not banks, could cause the next recession. 1. The next debt crisis: There's a $6.3 trillion elephant in the room. And it just might cause the next recession.\nThe last downturn was triggered by Wall Street and Americans accumulating too much debt — particularly in the sizzling housing market.\nA decade later, it's Corporate America borrowing with gusto. Egged on by extremely low rates, US companies have piled on a record-setting $6.3 trillion of debt, according to S&P Global Ratings.\nAll that debt is easy to ignore right now. Default rates are minuscule. Companies are sitting on tons of cash, and their coffers are growing thanks to the soaring US economy and corporate tax cuts.\nBut eventually, both the economy and corporate profits will slow, leaving companies less firepower to pay down debt. And it won't be as easy to roll over the debt that's due. Debt-laden companies would be vulnerable to rising borrowing costs caused by the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes.\nIf companies are stuck in a credit crunch, they will have to pull back on hiring and investment. That could be a recipe for a recession.\n\"Corporates, not consumers or banks, will cause [the] next recession,\" Michael Hartnett, Bank of America Merrill Lynch's chief investment strategist, wrote to clients on Thursday.\nCorporate America's debt binge has helped finance the recovery. Companies have borrowed to open factories, buy equipment and develop products. A chunk of that debt has also gone to reward Wall Street with massive stock buybacks.\nAfter a decade of low rates, companies have taken on more debt relative to the size of the economy than ever before. Total US business debt as a percentage of GDP is at a record high, according to David Ader of Informa Financial Intelligence.\nThe riskiest category of borrowers has never been more leveraged. Companies with junk credit ratings are holding a record low $8 of debt for every $1 of cash, according to S&P.\nAnd then there are so-called zombie companies — which can't even afford interest payments, despite the strong economy and low rates.\nBen Breitholtz, data scientist at Bianco Research, found that 14% of the companies in the S&P 1500 don't have enough earnings before interest and taxes to cover interest expenses. That's above the world average of 10%.\nThose zombie companies are probably cringing as central bankers slowly end the easy-money days. The Fed is expected to lift rates on Wednesday, the eighth hike since late 2015. Four more moves before the end of 2019 may be in the cards.\nAt the same time, the Fed is trimming its $4.5 trillion balance sheet — an experiment that could contribute to higher borrowing costs as foreign central banks follow suit and unload bonds.\nBank of America's Hartnett warned that an \"aggressive\" Fed in 2019 could trigger a \"credit crunch\" — not just in emerging markets, but in Corporate America.\n2. Trade war: The US-China confrontation will escalate on Monday when the United States imposes tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. On the same day, China has pledged to retaliate with a tariff on $60 billion of American goods.\nThe trade war is causing problems for Walmart, Procter & Gamble and a host of other companies that sell products imported from China or depend on Chinese goods in their supply chains.\n3. Nike earnings: What do Nike executives have to say about the response to their Colin Kaepernick ad campaign? We'll find out Tuesday, when the company reports earnings.\nNike has had a good year: US sales are growing, and the stock is up 35%.\n4. Economy watch: The US government on Thursday will give the final reading on economic growth in the second quarter. The previous revision showed a strong growth rate of 4.2%.\n5. Coming this week:\nMonday — US imposes tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods; MacOS Mojave launches\nTuesday — KB Home (KBH) and Nike (NKE) earnings; US consumer confidence\nWednesday — Bed Bath & Beyond and Carmax earnings; Federal Reserve interest rate decision; US new home sales for August\nThursday — Rite Aid, Carnival and Accenture earnings; final revision of US second-quarter GDP\nFriday — End of Q3"

        "“Abundance” Lobby Uses Trendy Words to Hide Same Old Attacks on the Environment. Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.\nOne of the Trump administration’s top priorities has been its devastating, unilateral rollback of renewable energy projects and environmental regulations — and a corresponding, aggressive push for fossil fuel interests.\nBut to hear a growing chorus of “abundance” proponents tell it, the real obstacle to climate progress is environmental regulation itself.\nIn a disturbing trend, influential politicians and commentators are propagating the idea that U.S. environmental regulation is too stringent, which they blame for stalling worthwhile progress in all sorts of key realms, from housing to mass transit to renewable energy projects. Proponents of this worldview loosely refer to their agenda as “abundance,” which they say characterizes the techno-utopia we can build if we eliminate regulatory constraints.\nNever miss another story\nGet the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day.\nAs an illustration, organizers of the “Abundance” conference taking place this week in Washington, D.C., describe the “abundance” movement as “a cross-partisan coalition committed to accelerating economic growth, reinforcing American leadership in science and technology, dismantling bureaucratic inertia, restoring effective governance, and reducing the cost of living.”\nThere are many unfounded ideological assumptions in this statement. Is “bureaucratic inertia” a significant obstacle to desirable outcomes in energy, housing, transportation, or any other sector? Does “restoring effective governance” entail less regulation, necessarily? Is “reducing the cost of living” the single most important thing we can do to relieve the serious economic hardship that many people face today? The “abundance” lobby wants us to believe that the answer to each of these questions is “yes.”\nThis argument isn’t just being made by polluting industries and their supporters, but also by people supposedly concerned about mitigating climate change. They claim that environmental regulations are getting in the way of building renewable energy capacity quickly (although a great many of these critics are not specialists in environmental policy.) One approving reviewer of Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson’s book Abundance, for example, claims that the “biggest thing blocking the greening of American energy” has been “progressive environmental laws that have allowed NIMBYs to sue solar plants and transmission lines into oblivion,” asserting this as the truth without a shred of evidence.\nIn the recent past, this idea was referred to as “permitting reform” and primarily associated with fossil fuel backers like former Sen. Joe Manchin (D-West Virginia). Now it’s gotten a rebrand. Whatever you call it, the justification for a deregulatory “abundance” agenda is flat-out wrong. But like many bad ideas with powerful backers, it could still become conventional wisdom unless it’s aggressively dispelled.\nWhat’s Actually Blocking Renewable Energy?\nThe “abundance” lobby cites only anecdotal evidence, such as the long delays and cost overruns for high-speed rail construction in California, to support their claim of regulations choking the growth of renewable energy and clean transportation. Data and peer-reviewed studies tell a different story.\nAt a logistical level, the wait time for new generation capacity to connect to the grid — known as the interconnection queue — is the main obstacle to bringing renewable energy online. In practice, what this means is that permitted (and sometimes fully built) solar and wind generation and energy storage projects have to wait for years for permission to connect to the grid. In 2023, the electric generation and storage capacity waiting in the interconnection queue was more than twice the installed generation capacity in the U.S.\nWhat’s more, the capacity in the interconnection queue was overwhelmingly wind and solar generation and energy storage, while the existing capacity was dominated by fossil energy. This problem can be fixed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) directing regional grid operators to connect renewable energy to the grid quickly — in other words, more regulation.\nA peer-reviewed study has shown that most delays in permitting under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) are attributable to budgetary constraints limiting the ability of permitting agencies to hire sufficient numbers of qualified staff (sometimes because of spending cuts by Congress), and staff turnover at permitting agencies (where qualified staff reviewing a project sometimes leave the agency before the review is complete), along with project backers failing to get key information to permitting agencies — not to the stringency of the NEPA permitting process. Another peer-reviewed study concluded that the vast majority of renewable energy projects are already subject to streamlined procedures, or not subject to federal permitting review at all.\nThis isn’t to say that stories of renewable projects getting tied up with bureaucratic delays are untrue. But to use them as an argument for weakening environmental review is like using the proliferation of online hate and misinformation to justify curbs on legitimate free speech. Procedural protections exist for a reason, and it’s a terrible idea to weaken them just because bad faith players sometimes misuse them.\nCuriously, “abundance” proponents are largely not advancing proposals to speed up permitting of renewable energy exclusively while limiting or banning fossil fuels. Instead, it appears they want to weaken environmental regulation period.\nBut if more fossil fuel infrastructure is built as a consequence of weakening environmental review, the earth’s climate is cooked. This is basic math. If the U.S. keeps expanding its fossil fuel production, these fuels will keep emitting greenhouse gases when burned. Even if domestic fossil fuel use is rapidly replaced with renewables, the excess oil and gas produced will be exported to emit greenhouse gases somewhere else.\nBut “abundance” advocates have not made opposing new fossil fuel infrastructure a core plank of their agenda, raising the possibility that their professed concern for climate mitigation may be disingenuous.\nJustice Denied\nStrikingly missing from the “abundance” agenda is any serious consideration of justice.\nTwenty-one percent of income in the U.S. goes to the top 1 percent of earners, while the bottom half of income earners receive only 13 percent. The wealthiest 10 percent of households own more than two-thirds of wealth in the U.S., while the bottom half of households by wealth own only 2.5 percent. The racial wealth gap is striking, with Black families twice as likely as white families to have a net wealth of zero.\nIn this context, attributing the inability of large numbers of people to access basic necessities like electricity or heating to physical shortages — instead of to poverty and extreme inequality — is naive at best.\nWe have a serious energy poverty problem in the U.S., with 27 percent of all households experiencing difficulty paying their energy bills. These numbers go up to 52 percent for Black and Indigenous households, and 57 percent for households with an annual income below $10,000.\nHowever, the U.S. produces more oil and gas than needed to meet domestic demand, and is a net exporter. Likewise, we generate enough electricity to meet demand, and our electric grid is highly reliable. Increasing supply is not going to solve a problem rooted in economic and racial inequality.\nA large body of peer-reviewed scientific studies have demonstrated how communities have been treated as sacrifice zones for the benefit of polluting industries, on the basis of race and class. Weakening environmental regulations will worsen these disparities, by robbing communities of the few legal protections they have from polluting industry. A mentality solely focused on rapidly scaling upwards — without any regard for expanding environmental justice — will only exacerbate these inequalities.\nThe Same Old Bad Ideas\nFor all of the attention it’s received, “abundance” is hardly a new idea. It combines two bad ideas from the past, presented in a shiny new package.\nOne is “all of the above” energy policy, the official (and dangerously wrong) Obama energy doctrine. Every credible analysis shows that in order to avert climate catastrophe, it’s imperative to phase out fossil fuel production even as we expand renewable energy.\nThe other bad idea embodied in abundance is trickle-down economics: ignore inequality and expand the economic pie, and people at the bottom will benefit. That’s why “abundance” advocates insist on expanding supply instead of addressing distribution. Decades of experience with trickle-down economics shows that it makes the rich richer at the expense of the rest of us.\nThe notion of “abundance” has superficial appeal, even to unsuspecting progressives. It invokes job creation, higher material living standards for all, and mitigating climate change by building more renewable energy. That’s why it’s important to understand it as a resurrection of trickle-down economics to support a fossil fuel industry agenda.\nProgressives must fight for a very different agenda to solve real-world problems of poverty, climate change, and scarcity of affordable housing, clean transportation, and health care. Unlike the “abundance” vision, the progressive agenda needs to be community-driven and not top-down. We must wrest power from the wealthy and powerful interests who are the real reason why we can’t have good things, acting together to confront the fossil fuel industry, Wall Street banks, health insurers, and corrupt government officials who side with these industries instead of the public interest.\nKeep the press free. Fight political repression.\nTruthout urgently appeals for your support. Under pressure from an array of McCarthyist anti-speech tactics, independent journalists at Truthout face new and mounting political repression.\nWe rely on your support to publish journalism from the frontlines of political movements.

        "Australia news live: Pocock says Labor’s emissions target not ambitious enough after Ley lashes government’s ‘trifecta’ of energy failures. David Pocock says emissions reduction target ‘not ambitious enough’\nIndependent senator David Pocock just spoke to the media about the emissions reduction targets, saying the levels announced by the Albanese government did not go far enough to address the major threat of climate change.\nHe said:\nIt is not ambitious enough to allow us to go to the world stage and to push big emitters, the rest of the world, to do better. We know what is at stake. We have seen in the national climate assessment just what climate change is going to do to our country, is going to do to our communities, the ocean that we love, the reefs that we love, the bushland that we love, the native species that make this continent so incredible.\nAnd yet we have a government that is not listening to the science.\nPocock added:\nWe cannot give up on this. We have to keep fighting and keep pushing, the Labor party, the major parties to take our future seriously.\nTownsville mayor Troy Thompson has responded to the announcement that he faces sacking from the council in parliament this morning.\nThompson was elected mayor last year, but was suspended over allegations he’d misled the electorate about his military history. Local government minister Ann Leahy told parliament she had issued him with a 14-day show cause notice to explain why he shouldn’t be dismissed from the council. Thompson said on Facebook:\nThese are allegations – not findings. And they have been brought forward by a minister who, in my view, is politically conflicted in this matter. Her recent comments suggest more about point-scoring and political distraction than genuine concern for due process or the Townsville community.\nMy legal team is prepared to respond in full once the allegations have been formally provided. Until now I have not been afforded natural justice by either the state or local government. That is unacceptable in a democratic system that claims to value fairness and integrity.\nThompson was referred to the state’s Crime and Corruption Commission last year after allegations he embellished his military record by stating he spent five years in the army, including time with “SAS Swanbourne”.\nTownsville mayor asked to ‘show cause’ to save job\nControversial Townsville mayor Troy Thompson will be issued with a show cause notice today to explain why he shouldn’t be sacked by the state government.\nLocal government minister Anne Leahy told parliament on Thursday that she had made the decision after a briefing by the Crime and Corruption Commission last month which “set out serious allegations”. Leahy said:\nI will today issue councillor Thomson with a formal show cause notice. This will provide him with 14 days to respond and sets out in detail the basis of my concerns, as required under Section 120 of the Local Government Act 2009. The notice includes a detailed explanation of the factual basis for forming my reasonable belief that dismissal may be appropriate.\nFollowing the 14-day period and upon receipt of councillor Thomson’s response, I will carefully consider the matters raised before making a final decision.\nMr Speaker, these are serious matters, and the actions I have taken reflect this government’s firm commitment to transparency, natural justice and the highest standards of integrity in local government. At every step, my focus has been on the people of Townsville, they deserve a council that is stable, accountable and able to deliver for its community.\nThompson was elected as Townsville mayor last year. He was suspended by Leahy on full pay after allegations he misled the electorate about his military history.\nLittleproud says Nationals won’t support ‘nonsense’ targets\nUnsurprisingly, Littleproud says of the target:\nSo we won’t be supporting these interim targets. We won’t be legislating targets. That’s nonsense.\nWhat we’ll do is be responsible. What we will be is sensible and what we’ll make sure is we put Australian families and Australian business at the core of this because, coming to Australian families, whether it be directly through job losses or through their energy bill or through their food bill or whether their daily movement around this country, you are going to pay the price of this.\nClimate target ‘nothing more than an expensive charade’, Nationals leader says\nNationals leader David Littleproud is speaking about Labor’s new emissions target.\nHe says it’s “nothing more than an expensive charade on the people of Australia”.\nThe reality is that in three years of government they haven’t reduced emissions at all, yet they’re trying to tell us that they’re going to take us from around 26 to 28% of reduction that we achieved … to 62% by 2035. They can’t do it and they can’t explain how they’re going to do it. And the detail around the cost. Australians need to know that they’re going to foot the bill for this. They’re going to foot a very expensive bill, either through their energy bills but also through their grocery bills and everything else they buy. So the Albanese government is very much big on rhetoric, but not a lot on detail.\n‘Worst is over’ when it comes to cocoa prices but retail chocolate prices to remain high for longer\nThe cost of cocoa is forecast to reduce significantly by mid-2027, but retail chocolate prices will take longer to fall and are still expected to remain higher than they were four years ago.\nResearchers at the agribusiness bank have published a new report that found consumers can expect some relief from rising chocolate prices, which are today more than 50% higher than they were in 2021.\nThe price has jumped markedly in the last year alone. In September last year, a premium-branded 100g chocolate tablet retailed at EUR 2.93 at the time at a Dutch supermarket, the report said.\nThe same product is now retailing at EUR 3.95, an increase of nearly 35% in just 12 months.\nPaul Joules, an agriculture analysist at RaboResearch, says the surge in retail chocolate prices was caused by a “cocoa shock” or crisis in the industry caused by poor harvests, crop disease and “structural supply issues”.\nJoules says while the worst is over, global cocoa prices will remain above “pre-crisis” levels due to ongoing issues including aging trees, crop disease, and climate volatility, which means retail prices could take longer to fall. He said:\nThe chocolate market is entering a new era of higher costs and persistent volatility, requiring agility and continuous adaptation from industry players.\nWhile the peak of chocolate retail price inflation may be behind us, the pressure remains, and the industry is hedging its bets for a resilient future.\nDavid Pocock says emissions reduction target ‘not ambitious enough’\nIndependent senator David Pocock just spoke to the media about the emissions reduction targets, saying the levels announced by the Albanese government did not go far enough to address the major threat of climate change.\nHe said:\nIt is not ambitious enough to allow us to go to the world stage and to push big emitters, the rest of the world, to do better. We know what is at stake. We have seen in the national climate assessment just what climate change is going to do to our country, is going to do to our communities, the ocean that we love, the reefs that we love, the bushland that we love, the native species that make this continent so incredible.\nAnd yet we have a government that is not listening to the science.\nPocock added:\nWe cannot give up on this. We have to keep fighting and keep pushing, the Labor party, the major parties to take our future seriously.\nLey says there is ‘no division’ among Coalition to oppose ‘latest piece of trainwreck energy policy’\nLey said she just came out of a shadow cabinet meeting and said the Coalition is unified in its plans to oppose the emissions reductions targets.\nShe said:\nI can assure you there was absolutely no division in opposing Labor’s latest piece of trainwreck energy policy. And we know that we’re doing this on behalf of hard-working Australians who actually expect better from a government whose credibility is in tatters.\nSussan Ley on emissions reduction target: ‘you cannot trust a single thing this government says’\nThe opposition leader, Sussan Ley, says the Albanese government’s emissions reduction targets “fails on both counts” when it came to cost and credibility, adding she is deeply concerned about how much the plan will cost Australians and the details as to how it will take place.\nShe said during a press conference:\nUnder this government we’re seeing a trifecta of energy failures. Costs are up. Reliability is down. And emissions are flatlining.\n… You cannot trust a single thing this government says.\nIf the government wants to have an honest conversation with Australians, they need to be upfront about announcements they make in critical areas of energy. Energy is the economy. They need to be upfront about what it will actually cost. Australians deserve to know this.\nMore than 600,000 Indigenous and Torres Strait Islander people enrolled to vote\nFor the first time, the estimated Indigenous enrolment rate is more than 600,000 people, according to new figures from the Australian Electoral Commission.\nThe new data shows an estimated 93% of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are now enrolled to vote, with 16,000 First Nations people estimated to have enrolled in the past year. The AEC has visited 50 communities since the 2025 election to improve electoral participation.\nThe national enrolment rate for the general population is 98.1%.\nJeff Pope, the acting commissioner of the AEC, said in a statement:\nWe’ve been working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities for many years now as part of our commitment to closing the gap in the Indigenous enrolment rate.\nThere is clearly still more work to do, but we’re very pleased with the significant increases to the figures over the past several years.\nAustralian government announces 2035 emissions reduction target – video\nIn his announcement, prime minister Anthony Albanese said: “It is the right target to protect our environment, to protect and advance our economy and jobs and to ensure that we act in our national interest and in the interest of this and future generations”.\nEmissions reduction target ‘a denial of climate justice’, 350.org says\n350.org, a major international climate change group, said the targets announced today were “nowhere near what is needed to secure our survival”.\nFenton Lutunatabua, the group’s deputy head of regions, said in a statement:\nAnything less than a 75% cut this decade backed by a plan to phase out coal, oil and gas is not a climate plan, it’s a denial of climate justice.\nPacific peoples are already living the losses that come from every fraction of a degree of warming. The supposed ‘sweet spot’ decided by the Albanese government is nowhere near what is needed to secure our survival. Not only that, but it doesn’t address the enormous burden of Australia’s fossil fuel exports, the consequences of which the children of the Pacific will have to bear.\nBrittany Higgins to appeal damages after defamation ruling\nBrittany Higgins will appeal a $341k payout and 80% of legal costs to her former boss, ex-Liberal senator Linda Reynolds, after a Western Australian supreme court ruled last month she defamed the once-Liberal frontbencher in two social media posts.\nTottle ruled Reynolds’ reputation was damaged by a 2022 social media post from Higgins’ partner David Sharaz, which Higgins responded to, as well as an Instagram story published by Higgins in July 2023.\nHiggins’ legal team, however, successfully defended a third social media post – also found to be defamatory – as honest opinion, fair comment and qualified privilege. Reynolds was unable to prove Higgins and Sharaz had concocted a conspiracy to publicly release the details of Higgins’s alleged rape with the “sole or predominant purpose” of destroying the former senator’s reputation, Tottle’s judgment said.\nThe court ruled that Higgins pay $315,000 in damages with an additional $26,109.25 in interest. Earlier this month, the court made a separate ruling on additional costs, ordering Higgins to pay 80% of Reynolds’ legal costs for the five-week defamation trial. It’s expected the total bill will easily surpass million-dollar territory.\nThe appeal notices show Higgins’ legal team is not appealing the judgment but focusing on the damages payout and the direction to pay 80% of Reynolds’ legal bills.\nAnalysis: Labor's climate targets promise everyone a prize\nAdam Morton\nThe Albanese government has announced an Oprah Winfrey-style emissions target for 2035 - tried to promise (nearly) everyone a prize.\nWe haven’t had time to absorb the advice that underpins it, but the range of 62% to 70% is clearly at least partly a political solution. It is extraordinarily wide.\nAt the bottom end, the goal is clearly designed to dampen criticism from business organisations arguing for less action. At the top end it meets a demand from some scientists and climate campaigners that it must include a number with a “7” in front of it - that is, that it reaches into the 70s.\nThis won’t be enough to nullify criticism: it is already pouring into my inbox from climate-focused organisations and scientists. The reality is the target sets a minimum goal of 62% but scientists say the country’s part in meeting the goals of the 2015 Paris agreement would be more than 75% - possibly significantly more.\nThe range is well below what the Climate Change Authority thought was “ambitious, but achievable” early last year when it nominated 65% to 75%. Why the change? We need more detailed answers on that than we got at the press conference.\nWill this goal help Australia take a leading role in avoiding the worst projections set out in the national risk assessment released on Monday? Certainly not if we end up at 62%.\nBut what matters now is the policies. And we will need a lot more - a lot more - to get where we need to be.\nFortescue head says Labor has shown ‘courage of leadership’ but calls for even higher emissions cuts\nAndrew Forrest, chairman of mining giant Fortescue, has also called on the government to be more ambition, arguing the upper range of 70% should be a “floor” not a ceiling.\nIt [the government] has shown the courage of leadership. Yet let me be clear: the upper range of its target – 70% – must be a floor, not a ceiling.\nA cut of at least 75% is what is needed for Australia to pursue emissions reductions in line with the science. This remains the only course that can avert the accelerating impacts of a world warmed beyond 1.5°C.\nFortescue was one of more than 500 businesses including Atlassian, Canva, and Unilever calling for a 75% target in the lead up to the announcement.\nFormer emergency leaders are also warning the target will leave emergency responders in a critical situation. The Emergency Leaders for Climate Action group warns the bottom end of the target will fall “dangerously short of what’s needed to protect both communities and emergency responders.” The former commissioner of Fire & Rescue NSW, Greg Mullins, says:\nIf that’s the level of risk we’re accepting, then what’s the plan for dealing with it? Emergency leaders want to see a concrete, well-funded plan for how the Albanese government is going to support communities and first responders to adapt to the compounding, cascading and concurrent disasters its own risk assessment outlines if we’re choosing not to cut climate pollution any further or faster.\nEnvironmental groups’ verdict on Labor emissions targets: ‘weak’\nWe’re getting plenty of reaction to the 2035 target, and environment groups are pushing for far more ambitious action.\nGreenpeace has called the target “weak” while the Australian Conservation Foundation has labelled it “timid”.\nBoth groups accuse the government of prioritising the fossil fuel industry over community safety.\nGreenpeace Australia Pacific says the target is “not science-aligned, and undermines global action under the Paris Agreement to limit warming to 1.5C”.\nIt prioritises fossil fuel profits and business interests over people, and effectively abandons our commitment under the Paris Agreement… a temperature goal that is non-negotiable for Pacific nations staring down the barrel of climate catastrophe.\nThe ACF’s climate and energy program manager, Gavan McFadzean, says:\nA target range of 62% to 70%falls significantly short on all measures of what’s needed, with the government’s plans preparing Australia only to meet the bottom end of the range.\nPM won’t say how much power bills will drop under 2035 plan\nThe prime minister says there needs to be “lean in” from all levels of government and business to get to the target.\nHe also adds that the amount of wind and solar power in China is now “nearly twice as much as the rest of the world combined. Just a fun fact”:\nWe have a target range, it depends upon as we have outlined, whether there is a lean in and by other levels of government, by the private sector as well, industry … we know that the federal government can only do so much.\nFinally, Albanese is asked exactly how much power bills will come down (which makes all the journalists in the room laugh).\nAlbanese won’t give a figure – you might remember how much the opposition likes to bring up Labor’s pre-2022 election promise of a reduction in energy bills by $275, which they had to abandon. The PM says:\nYou yourself laughed when he asked that question so, it should be treated in the spirit which you’ve done. What we know is if we do not act, they will be a cost [to] the economy as [the] treasurer has outlined. They will be: lower wages, lower growth, less jobs.",

Ley says cost of net zero ‘looks too high’ as she sidesteps question on climate ructions\nBenita Kolovos\nKieran Rooney from the Age asks: “How does net zero fit into your economic vision and does it undermine your leadership when your Coalition colleagues come out with such a strong position on the issue?\nLey replies:\nI’m pleased to get a question on energy, because it is one of the factors of productivity in this country that is dragging our economy backwards. And that’s something that my colleagues and I agree with wholeheartedly, which is what I’ve said, and others have said, we will not have net zero at any cost, because the cost can be too high.

Let’s hold that conversation until they actually make their announcement.\nShe says the party’s policy is being led by Dan Tehan, with input from Ted O’Brien and others:\nSo our energy policy, more broadly, will be underpinned by two fundamental themes: that we must have a stable, reliable energy grid to deliver affordable energy for households and businesses, and that we will play our role in reducing emissions in a responsible and transparent way.\nLily McCaffrey from the Australian asks if Andrew Hastie crosses the floor on Barnaby Joyce’s net zero repeal deal, what’s going to happen? She also asks if it’s becoming clear that she’ll have to ditch or modify net zero by 2050.\nLey replies:\nEvery day, I get another different set of hypotheticals about a whole range of discussions that you might see in the media. So I’ll simply say this, the shadow cabinet when we meet and discuss energy will do so with the passion and the determination that I described in my previous answer about backing in Australians, their industries and their future, and I can extend that to the broader party room.\nAnd note too that all of my colleagues are participating in the discussion on energy right now, as they should. And I love it when people have strong views and express them, because they’re coming from the people they’re listening to from all corners of this country, you get the best possible outcome in decision-making, when you harness those ideas and you listen closely.\nBHP ‘unAustralian’, Queensland deputy premier says\nQueensland’s deputy premier has labelled BHP “unAustralian” anddefended the state’s mining royalties scheme after the mining giant blamed it for its decision to mothball a coalmine and cut hundreds of jobs while also reviewing the future of its training academy.\nTasmanian premier ‘disappointed’ at school closures\nTasmania’s premier has said he is “very disappointed” after staff strikes closed 18 schools across the state on Wednesday.\nSchool cleaners, grounds staff and kitchen assistants left work and rallied outside Parliament House in Hobart today, calling for improved working conditions, after years of rising workloads without an increase in staffing. The stop-work action forced about one in 10 schools across the state to close their doors.\nAmy Brumby, the Tasmania coordinator for the United Workers Union, said in a statement:\nMembers are rallying today to call for the immediate investment in [more] roles to match the reality of modern school operations and ensure student safety and educational standards can be maintained.\nTasmania’s premier, Jeremy Rockliff, told reporters:\nI’m very disappointed at the school closures today. Parents and families are being disrupted and our young people are there to go to school and to learn.\nRockliff rejected responsibility for the closures and said he was confident continued negotiations would resolve the disputes, describing the government’s recent offer of a 3% pay rise to all state employees as “very strong”:\nI’m a very big believer in supporting our facility attendants to be rewarded for the work that they do.\nThe Tasmanian government confirmed there was no indication that further school closures were expected. Negotiations are ongoing.\nUTS’s teacher education program set to close as university reveals plan to slash more than 1,000 subjects\nThe University of Technology Sydney will close its teacher education program and public health school as part of a sweeping restructure that would remove more than 1,100 subjects to return the institution to surplus.\nThe proposed cuts, released on Wednesday, are part of the debt-ridden university’s strategy to reduce expenditure by $100m annually.\nUnder the proposal, the school of professional practice and leadership would be closed as part of a plan to reduce the total number of schools from 24 to 15, and the faculty of law, business school and transdisciplinary school would be combined.\nLast squad of NSW RFS deployed in Canada return home after devastating wildfire season\nThe last contingent of NSW Rural Fire Service personnel arrived back in Australia after a long deployment aiding Canada with its wildfire season.\nThe agency said the returning personnel were now planning to enjoy “well deserved rest before the official start of bush fire danger period”.\nCanada saw one of its worst fire seasons on record, with scientists warning climate change was prolonging and exacerbating the burning. Thousands of fires across the country scorched more than 8.7m hectares of land, with officials warning last month the figures were Canada’s “new reality”.\nLey says cost of net zero ‘looks too high’ as she sidesteps question on climate ructions\nBenita Kolovos\nKieran Rooney from the Age asks: “How does net zero fit into your economic vision and does it undermine your leadership when your Coalition colleagues come out with such a strong position on the issue?\nLey replies:\nI’m pleased to get a question on energy, because it is one of the factors of productivity in this country that is dragging our economy backwards.

And I love it when people have strong views and express them, because they’re coming from the people they’re listening to from all corners of this country, you get the best possible outcome in decision-making, when you harness those ideas and you listen closely.\nLey is asked why politicians are struggling with big ideas to handle the big problems in the country. She quips that she’s not going to make a “political hit here about what I see on the government benches” as it would be “gratuitous”. She adds:\nBut I love big ideas. We all do – our party members do, my colleagues in the room do … obviously there are challenges around the political cycle. We all know that if you’ve got three-year elections, then that bumps into a lot of ongoing funding.\nShe says her colleagues are in the “policy process” stage with meetings every week:\nLey says government’s energy policy is a ‘train wreck’\nLey is asked how she would improve business confidence in Australia. She says she wants to see further domestic and international investment.\nLey goes on:\nOne thing I want to mention is environmental approvals, because we are lagging incredibly badly. For a typical gas project, I think the approval time has blown out to 500 days from 100 days … investors are going somewhere else, or they’re not extending where they are, or they’re downsizing. They’re not putting on those extra workers. So this government has completely taken its eye off the ball.\nShe also describes the government’s energy policy as a “train wreck”.\nLey says she wants to bring Australians ‘with us’ on economic plans\nThe federal opposition leader, Sussan Ley, has concluded her first major economic speech at the Committee for Economic Development of Australia event in Melbourne and is now taking questions from the crowd.\nHer first questions, though, are from the Ceda chief executive, Melinda Cilento, who asks her how she would balance her economic plans with the social compact.\nLey says she wants to “bring Australians with us on this journey”. She goes on:\nIt just seems like a whole lot of numbers and statistics but everyone [including] millennials or gen Z, they understand debt. They’ve got a student debt. They understand household debt when they can’t make that payment by the end of the fortnight.\nThey understand that perhaps they’re never going to be able to scrape up enough money for a deposit on the first home or any home.\nSo we need to frame the conversation so that we tell them that we understand what their lives are like, and we reassure them that the social compact about responsible budget management is about intergenerational equity.\nRight now, every minute, $50,000 is spent on interest on the nation’s debt. And obviously people have got a lot of good ideas, but they all know that putting things on the credit card and then more things on the credit card is not the answer.\nJim Chalmers says Liberals run by ‘weird collection of cookers and crackpots’\nThe treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said earlier the “worst possible” thing for Australia to do would be to walk away from net zero commitments, adding a ding against the Liberal party amid the Coalition’s infighting over the emissions targets:\nThe Liberal party is run now by this weird collection of cookers and crackpots, and nowhere is that more obvious than when it comes to net zero …\nThese Liberals haven’t learned a thing. They haven’t changed a bit, they are as divided and divisive as they have ever been. You see that in their approach to net zero.\nLey says Coalition would undertake an audit of government spending where ‘every dollar would be tested’\nLey is outlining the Coalition’s economic priorities, including reining in spending and accounting for every dollar going out of the government coffers.\nShe says:\nSpending should only grow where it delivers real value, not just because the economy has grown. Every new dollar of spending would require a saving, a re-prioritisation or a reform that makes government leaner …\nEvery dollar would be tested. Is it delivering results? Does it reflect the core responsibilities of government? Can it be done more efficiently or not at all? This is not about mindless cuts, it is about smart choices and hard priorities.\nNews Corp to run Jewish Council ads calling for sanctions on Israel\nDaisy Dumas\nNews Corp says it is inaccurate to say a pro-Palestinian advertisement was pulled from its newspapers and has agreed to publish a progressive Jewish group’s call for sanctions on Israel.\nThe Jewish Council of Australia claimed on Tuesday evening its ads in Wednesday’s Daily Telegraph and Herald Sun had been pulled at the 11th hour after being legally approved and paid for.\nThe quarter-page ads feature the photos of hundreds of Australian Jews to mark the start of a national campaign and a petition calling for sanctions on the Israeli government, a two-way arms embargo and the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador to Australia in response to the atrocities committed in Gaza.\nA News Corp spokesperson said it was inaccurate to say the ads had been pulled and that the delay was due to “normal internal processes”.\nThe JCA said it was told on Wednesday morning an amended version of the ad could run on Thursday with the inclusion of the word “advertisement” in the image.\nSarah Schwartz, the executive officer of the JCA, said:\nOur ad really disrupts the message that all Jews support Israel and the message frequently put forward in News Corp newspapers that any criticism of Israel is antisemitic.\nWe have to keep persevering to have our voices heard in spaces where they otherwise wouldn’t be heard. We can’t give up on News Corp’s readership – this is a human issue."

        "Max Arfsten among those auditioning for a U.S. team in transition. (Photo credit: Adam Cairns/Columbus Dispatch / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images)\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio -- Max Arfsten is not paranoid, but every time he crosses the white line onto the soccer field he feels like the entire world is watching.\nActually, it's the weight of the World Cup as the Columbus Crew defender makes a late push for the 26-player U.S. men's national team roster for the tournament next summer in North America.\n'I'm auditioning every match, for sure,' he told Field Level Media after the U.S defeated Japan 2-0 in Columbus on Tuesday. 'I don't ever think anything is handed or given to me no matter what. So honestly, training is the same thing. It's an audition. I'm trying to prove myself every single time I step on the field. That's my mentality.'\nThe 24-year-old from Fresno, Calif., wasn't even on the U.S. radar until coach Mauricio Pochettino, who marked one year on the job on Wednesday, debuted him on Jan. 18 against Venezuela.\nSince then, Arfsten has a goal and four assists in 12 matches, including setting up Alex Zendejas for the first goal vs. Japan.\n'Just waiting for my moment,' Zendejas said of his first U.S. start since 2023. 'It's crazy to take all this in. I didn't expect to get called up.

        "Max Arfsten among those auditioning for a U.S. team in transition. Field Level Media\n12 Sep 2025, 04:49 GMT+10\n(Photo credit: Adam Cairns/Columbus Dispatch / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images)\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio -- Max Arfsten is not paranoid, but every time he crosses the white line onto the soccer field he feels like the entire world is watching.\nActually, it's the weight of the World Cup as the Columbus Crew defender makes a late push for the 26-player U.S. men's national team roster for the tournament next summer in North America.\n'I'm auditioning every match, for sure,' he told Field Level Media after the U.S defeated Japan 2-0 in Columbus on Tuesday. 'I don't ever think anything is handed or given to me no matter what. So honestly, training is the same thing. It's an audition. I'm trying to prove myself every single time I step on the field. That's my mentality.'\nThe 24-year-old from Fresno, Calif., wasn't even on the U.S. radar until coach Mauricio Pochettino, who marked one year on the job on Wednesday, debuted him on Jan. 18 against Venezuela.\nSince then, Arfsten has a goal and four assists in 12 matches, including setting up Alex Zendejas for the first goal vs. Japan.\n'Just waiting for my moment,' Zendejas said of his first U.S. start since 2023. 'It's crazy to take all this in. I didn't expect to get called up. Just trying to take advantage of every opportunity.'\nArfsten, Zendejas, Cristian Roldan and Folarin Balogun improved their stock in the match thanks to a change in schematics.\nFor the first time in his 18 matches in charge, Pochettino rolled out a 3-4-2-1 formation after another dreadful performance on Sept. 6 using a 4-2-3-1 in a 2-0 loss to South Korea.\nThe switch allowed more players to work in familiar areas.

        "New-look USMNT show comfort and confidence in 2-0 win over Japan. This United States’ international window once looked like it could be disastrous. Now, it has been upgraded to strangely uneven.\nA much-improved US got goals from Alejandro Zendejas and Folarin Balogun to beat a heavily rotated Japan side 2-0 at Lower.com Field in Columbus. The result lends some credence to Mauricio Pochettino’s insistence that the US’s recent subpar results were all part of a plan with a single target: arriving at the World Cup in peak form.\nThe US head coach had been in a defiant mood almost from the moment the final whistle blew on his side’s 2-0 loss to South Korea on Saturday – a game in which the US started reasonably well, but were continually undone by miscommunication at the back and a lack of clinical finishing up top. Pochettino turned heads when he told reporters afterward that he felt the US had been the better team overall – a view he doubled down on after arriving in Columbus, but with an additional edge.\n“We need to understand that we need to have quite a roster and players that we need to know and give the possibility to play,” he said. “At the World Cup, it’s not a moment to make tests or to give the possibility to get experience. That is why you cannot be surprised.”\nPochettino promised rotation and new ideas for evaluation, and that’s what he delivered: A 3-4-2-1 formation was deployed against Japan, with Chris Richards, Tim Ream and Tristan Blackmon making up the back three, 21-year-old Orlando starlet Alex Freeman at right wingback and the Columbus Crew’s Max Arfsten on the left. Cristian Roldan, who came as a late addition to the squad, started in central midfield alongside Tyler Adams, while Zendejas started alongside Christian Pulisic as dual No 10s behind Balogun at striker.\nIn each line, a new arrangement gave opportunities for players who are unlikely to be starters in next summer’s World Cup, but who most certainly could play a significant role. In defense, Blackmon made up for a rough international debut on Saturday with a solid display, showing that he could at least be an option for a thin US center-back group. Out wide, Arfsten took advantage of being put in his best position by attacking at will with fewer defensive responsibilities, firing in the cross that led to the United States’ opener. Roldan was his steady, professional self next to Adams. And in attack, Zendejas showed off the work rate and quality of technique that make him relatively rare among the US options at winger.\nOf course, things were far from perfect. As he had against South Korea, Balogun failed to score early on, despite a series of point-blank chances within the first 20 minutes, with Japan goalkeeper Keisuke Osako doing well to make a couple saves amid that flurry. The US remained too passive on both sides of the ball, though not anywhere near as much as they were against the Koreans. And goalkeeper Matt Freese, while he kept a shutout and made some very nice saves, did not always look sure-handed or confident when dealing with crosses and set pieces. The starting goalkeeper for this team remains an open question.\nIt must also be noted that Japan were without most of their usual starters, having used their first team in Saturday’s scoreless draw against Mexico. Still, the players on the field displayed all the hallmarks of head coach Hajime Moriyasu’s approach, attempting to use pace and skill to unbalance the US. The quality on the ball to make those moves count may have been lacking at times, but the rethought US backline played its role as well.\nThe breakthrough came after half an hour, with Arfsten putting moves on Japan’s Henry Mochizuki, taking him down the left-wing before lofting in a well-paced ball that fell at just the right height for Zendejas. The Club América winger accepted the invitation with gusto, taking the ball right out of the air with a defender on his back and guiding it into the bottom corner of the far post.\nZendejas celebrated by running to Arfsten, pointing at the Columbus Crew player to highlight to the home fans that their player had created what may prove an important breakthrough as the World Cup approaches.\nIt was after around this point, 30 minutes in, against South Korea that a decent US performance unraveled. On Tuesday, though, the US did much better to keep up the pressure. The Americans sustained possession, refused to allow Japan out of their own half, and threatened to score even if the final product was not always there, or attempts were blocked by desperate defending. The Japanese helped the US as well – at one point, Pulisic was able to easily intercept a pass out of the back, but he was quickly swarmed and his effort was blocked out of bounds.\nThat action seemed to wake up Pulisic from what had been another quiet performance in a US shirt. In the 48th minute, the Milan star did well to combine with Arfsten and Zendejas to fire on goal again, but the shot was blocked at the near post. Six minutes later, he went direct, cutting through the Japanese backline to latch on to a ball held up by Balogun, with Osako saving once again in what was an excellent performance for the keeper.\nIn the end, Pochettino’s thesis may have best been proven by Jack McGlynn and Damion Downs, both of whom came on as substitutes and nearly added three outstanding goals: McGlynn from two trademark curling shots from outside the box (one saved, one off the bar), and Downs from a nice interchange through the middle that was saved by Osako. They were the type of chances that come from a team that, at long last, seemed comfortable with the task at hand, and capable of fulfilling it.\nWhether that feeling will extend to the first team on the biggest stage of all next summer remains to be seen."

        "MPs raise concerns over Asda’s link to app offering high-interest loans to staff. An influential group of MPs has sought assurances that Asda is not “squeezing staff” to drive profit after it emerged they are being offered high-interest loans by Wagestream, a company in which the retailer’s owner has a stake.\nThe business and trade select committee has written to Asda over its links to the “financial wellbeing app” that recently began offering the supermarket’s staff loans of up to £25,000. The default arrangements for Wagestream’s “workplace loans” involve debt repayments being directly deducted from workers’ pay packets.\nA holding company controlled by Asda’s private equity owner TDR Capital is a shareholder in Wagestream, which has been offering Asda workers a range of other services, including savings pots and wage advances, since 2023.\nDocuments filed at Companies House show that the holding company – Bellis Financial Investments 2 –is one of a number of shareholders in Wagestream, alongside former Wonga payday loan investor Balderton Capital, and social impact investors including the Joseph Rowntree Foundation via the Fair by Design Fund.\nHowever, the Guardian understands that the retailer did not flag its financial link to Wagestream to staff when it initially launched the service to workers two years ago. Wagestream started offering “workplace loans” to Asda staff earlier this year.\nLiam Byrne, the chair of the business and trade committee, said he had written to Asda “to ask them to reassure us that frontline workers aren’t left facing sky-high interest rates, and that its workplace lending is compliant with Asda’s legal requirements under employment law”.\n“Asda is one of Britain’s most important employers with over 150,000 workers and is at the heart of our grocery market,” he said.\n“Our concern today is that instead of easing Asda’s debts, its parent company may be piling pressure on Asda’s people – squeezing staff to service liabilities and drive profit to its financial investments. If this is the case, it raises serious questions as to Asda’s responsible stewardship, and the long-term financial sustainability of the business as a whole.”\nAsda’s finance director, Michael Gleeson, told the committee in 2023 that a £100m investment in Wagestream and two other financial services businesses, had been funded out of proceeds from the £1.7bn sale of Asda’s warehouses which the company now has to pay rent on under a leaseback deal. “We are part owners of each of those three companies,” he told MPs. Bellis is understood to hold a 4% stake in Wagestream.\nAsda said it does not pay Wagestream for any services or receive any financial benefit if a member of staff chooses to use the app. However, as a shareholder, Asda’s parent group has a direct interest in itssuccess and would have the right to share of any future dividend payments or from the sale of the group.\nWagestream is yet to pay a dividend and remains loss-making, having last reported a £22.2m pre-tax loss in 2024.\nThat could change before long, however, with revenues having grown by more than two-thirds, 64%, to £36.9m last year, when it handed out 20.6m wage advances worth a total of £1.5bn.\nThe rollout of workplace loans could propel earnings, which have so far relied on fees linked to its wage advance product. Wagestream said a rise in revenues in the upcoming year would probably outpace costs and start “moving the business towards profitability in future periods”.\nA spokesperson for Asda, which is the UK’s third largest supermarket, said: “Asda offers colleagues access to a range of established financial products through a partner regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). These include salary advances, workplace loans and savings products paying a competitive interest rate of 4.33%, which is currently used by more than 18,000 colleagues.\n“Many other large employers, including all of Asda’s direct competitors in the grocery sector, offer similar products to their employees through the same, or competitor providers.”\nAsda added that all applications for Wagestream’s workplace loans were subject to “robust affordability checks” before being approved. “At present fewer than 2% of Asda colleagues have taken out a loan. The representative APR on these loans is 13.9%.”\nWagestream began rolling out the loans to clients like Asda at the end of 2024. Those loans come with a representative APR of between 13.9% and 19.9%, meaning at least 51% of borrowers will get that rate.\nBut the ultimate cap is negotiated with each employer, topping out at 34.9% APR. Wagestream insists that its model still saves borrowers an average of £593 a loan, with customers having been charged an average APR of 62% by former lenders before turning to the app.\nNadine Houghton, a national officer at the GMB union, which represents Asda workers, said it was concerned about the financial links between Asda and Wagestream: “It leaves a sour taste in the mouth that TDR has a financial interest in the app that facilitates Asda workers taking these financial risks while also being the overall decision maker for how much these workers are paid and the hours they are able to work.”\n“We now find out that Wagestream is offering dangerous loans at high interest rates and GMB members working in Asda tell us they have used the app to take advances on their pay which can contribute to a cycle of debt.\n“The bottom line is that employers should pay workers enough to live on, to have savings and to not need to rely on dangerous high-interest loans or advances on their pay just to cover day to day living costs.”\nWagestream said in a statement that “as a regulated financial services provider, Wagestream has a conflicts of interest policy and has implemented processes to review and monitor conflicts of interest to comply with FCA rules.”\n“TDR Capital’s holding in Wagestream does not create a conflict as it falls well below the thresholds set out by the FCA. As a minority shareholder, TDR Capital does not have operational or day-to-day control of any of Wagestream’s undertakings,” the statement added.\nWagestream said it considers potential conflicts when deciding on whether to partner with employers, which in turn sign its terms and conditions that require good consumer outcomes and transparency, including around fees.\nTDR declined to comment.",
        "Trump Family Gains Another $5B in Crypto Profits. Critics Call It Corruption.. Did you know that Truthout is a nonprofit and independently funded by readers like you? If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation.\nIn what Public Citizen called “the greatest corruption in presidential history,” U.S. President Donald Trump and his family added $5 billion in cash to their fortunes this Labor Day as his new cryptocurrency was opened to the public market.\nThe currency, known as WLFI, is owned by World Liberty Financial, a company founded by the president’s sons, Donald Trump, Jr., and Eric Trump. A Trump business entity owns 60 percent of the company and is entitled to 75 percent of the revenue from coin sales.\nAs the Wall Street Journal reported Monday:\nGet our free emails\nThe trading debut was most likely the biggest financial success for the president’s family since the inauguration…\nWLFI is likely now the Trumps’ most valuable asset, exceeding their decades-old property portfolio. While the president’s family has continued to pursue property deals around the world since taking office, the fast-moving crypto business has had the biggest early impact.\nCrypto is now the dominant source of Trump’s wealth. As an investigation by the anti-corruption group Accountable.US found last month, “President Trump’s net worth could roughly be $15.9 billion, with about $11.6 billion in uncounted crypto assets,” meaning that the digital currencies now make up 73 percent of his total net worth.\nIn addition to the tokens owned by World Liberty Financial, it found that two Trump-affiliated companies owned 80 percent of the $TRUMP meme coin as of May and had collected over $324 million in fees since Trump took office in January.\nMeanwhile, Trump Media, which owns his online platform Truth Social, bought $2 billion worth of Bitcoin in July and reserved another $300 million in Bitcoin options.\nAs America’s self-proclaimed “first crypto president,” Trump has sought to curb regulations against the volatile financial assets.\nIn July, Trump signed the GENIUS Act, which purports to establish the U.S.’s first regulatory framework for crypto. However, critics noted that the law designated so-called “stablecoins,” of which Trump owns many, as “commodities” rather than “securities,” allowing them to face much looser oversight.\nThough the bill passed with support from over 100 Democrats, Rep. Maxine Waters (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, warned that the bill “legitimizes Trump actively building the most corrupt self-dealing crypto environment this country has ever seen.”\nRep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) described Trump’s latest $5 billion windfall as “blatantly corrupt and a brazen abuse of power.”\n“The current occupant of the White House,” she said, “is putting personal profit above the people, using his power to illegally line the pockets of his family and billionaire friends while hanging everyday families out to dry by ripping away their healthcare, food assistance, raising the cost of consumer goods, gutting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and more.”\nWhile cryptocurrency is often billed as an asset available to everyone that levels the playing field of the finance world, in practice, its ownership is largely concentrated among the wealthiest Americans. According to a Harris poll published in April, nearly half of all crypto owners have a yearly income of over $150,000, putting them in the wealthiest 10% of the country.\n“Your family gets higher energy prices and cuts to healthcare. [Trump’s] family gets billions,” said Rep. Greg Casar (D-Texas), the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. “Corruption, plain and simple.”\nSen. Patty Murray (D-Wash), a strong advocate for crypto regulation, said that such blatant profiting from the presidency makes Trump “easily the most corrupt president in our country’s history,” and emphasized that “Republicans in Congress are not lifting a single finger to exercise basic oversight.”\nAccording to data from OpenSecrets, just three crypto industry-backed political action committees (PACs) poured over $133 million into the 2024 election. Though they spent the majority of that money supporting Republicans, nearly 40 percent of it went to Democrats.\nBut although all this money helped to buy what Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong called \"America's most pro-crypto Congress ever,\" according to Reuters, just 3 percent of legislators in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate own these assets themselves, including Sens. Dave McCormick (R-Pa.) and Tim Sheehy (R-Mon.), as well as Reps. Nick Begich (R-Ark.) and Mike Collins (R-Ga.).\nBut Trump's profiteering far exceeds the crypto holdings of every congressperson put together.\n\"We have only seen the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the damage that this corruption will inflict on the American people,\" said Bartlett Naylor, a financial reform advocate with Public Citizen. \"The impact of attempts by the Trump family and others to buy and sell politics and politicians will continue to ricochet.\"\nKeep the press free. Fight political repression.\nTruthout urgently appeals for your support. Under pressure from an array of McCarthyist anti-speech tactics, independent journalists at Truthout face new and mounting political repression.\nWe rely on your support to publish journalism from the frontlines of political movements.

(Reuters) - Crypto company Tether, the creator of the world's largest stablecoin, plans to launch a U.S.-based stablecoin designed for U.S. residents called USAT, the company's CEO Paolo Ardoino said on Friday.\nFormer White House official Bo Hines will be the CEO of the new venture, which aims to launch by the end of the year, Ardoino said at a press conference in New York.\nThe move is the latest sign of Tether, which is based in El Salvador, looking to bolster its presence in the U.S., where crypto companies have benefited from U.S. President Donald Trump's pro-crypto stance.\n\"I think it's a very exciting moment because we were under severe pressure from competitors that want to create a monopolistic environment in the United States,\" Ardoino said. \"We believe that Tether is the best product in the market.\"\nTether's dollar-pegged cryptocurrency, known as USDT, has a market capitalization of more than $169 billion, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko.\nTrump in July signed a law dubbed the GENIUS Act to create a regulatory regime for stablecoins, a huge win for crypto supporters who had long lobbied for such a regulatory framework in a bid to gain greater legitimacy.\nThe new law requires stablecoins to be backed by liquid assets - such as U.S. dollars and short-term Treasury bills - and for issuers to disclose publicly the composition of their reserves monthly.\nUSDT still plans to comply with the GENIUS Act and remain a foreign stablecoin issuer, Ardoino said, adding that the law provides a way for foreign stablecoins to receive reciprocity.\n\"We want people to know that Tether is here to participate in the U.S. economy in a huge way,\" said Hines, who was appointed as a strategic advisor to Tether in August after he departed his position as executive director of the President's Council of Advisers on Digital Assets.\n\"I think our expansion will be exorbitant over the course of the next 12 to 24 months,\" Hines said.\nArdoino said USAT will be issued by Anchorage Digital Bank, which has a national trust bank charter with the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.\nAnchorage will be one of the shareholders of the new venture, Ardoino said, declining to name the other shareholders. Cantor Fitzgerald will serve as USAT's custodian and preferred primary dealer, Tether said in a press release.\nUSAT will be headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, Hines said.\nThe move by Tether comes just three months after rival stablecoin firm Circle went public in the U.S. in a blockbuster IPO raised more than $1 billion. Shares in Circle were last down 5.8%.\nTether said it bought more than $33.1 billion of U.S. Treasury bills in 2024, making it the seventh largest buyer of U.S. government debt. In an April research note, JP Morgan analysts estimated that stablecoin issuers could become the third-largest buyer of Treasury bills in the coming years.\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had encouraged lawmakers to pass legislation to create federal rules for stablecoins, arguing that it could lead to a surge in demand for U.S. government debt.\nTether has previously come under scrutiny in the U.S. The company agreed to publish quarterly reserve reports under a 2021 settlement with the New York Attorney General's office, which accused Tether and its sister company Bitfinex of commingling client and corporate funds to cover up $850 million that went missing.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported last year that U.S. authorities were probing potential violations by the cryptocurrency firm of sanctions or anti-money laundering rules, but Ardoino said he had not seen any indication that Tether was under investigation.\n(Reporting by Hannah Lang in New York, Writing by Elizabeth Howcroft in Paris, Editing by Louise Heavens and Marguerita Choy)\nBy Hannah Lang"

        "When even Ben & Jerry’s can’t speak out, it’s clear: the era of corporate responsibility is over | Austin Sarat. When the history of this era is written, there will be much to say about the behavior of large corporations. And none of it will be good.\nAs the Trump administration has ramped up its assault on American democracy, many corporations have chosen to look the other way or to curry favor with the president. They have fired employees who were too outspoken in their criticism of Donald Trump – ABC’s suspension of Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night talkshow, after Kimmel’s remarks about Maga’s reaction to the killing of Charlie Kirk, is the latest example.\nOr corporations have muted their brand’s identification with progressive causes.\nOne casualty is Jerry Greenfield, co-founder and namesake of Ben & Jerry’s ice-cream. This week, he resigned from the company.\nHe did so because, he said in a statement, the politically outspoken company had been “silenced”.\nThe consumer goods company Unilever acquired Ben & Jerry’s in 2000, for a reported $326m. At the time, it agreed to respect the company’s independence.\nNo more, according to Greenfield.\n“Standing up for the values of justice, equity, and our shared humanity has never been more important,” Greenfield noted in explaining his resignation. But, he said: “Ben & Jerry’s has been silenced, sidelined for fear of upsetting those in power.”\nBen & Jerry’s crossed swords with Unilever last year when it sued the company for allegedly fighting its calls for a Gaza ceasefire and an end to US military support for Israel.\nThe 2024 suit claimed that Unilever had threatened to dismantle the ice-cream company’s independent board and punish members if Ben & Jerry’s issued a call for a ceasefire. (Unilever said it rejected “the claims made by B&J’s social mission board”. Its motion to dismiss the lawsuit is pending.)\nAnother flare-up occurred in March of this year, when, according to Ben & Jerry’s, Unilever fired its chief executive, David Stever, over his work to advance the company’s “social mission”.\nIf those allegations are true, Unilever would not be alone in trying to avoid offending the Trump administration or its supporters. This is just the latest sign that the era of corporate social and political responsibility is over.\nIce-cream lovers will now have to choose between their taste buds and their consciences.\nCorporate social responsibility (CSR) requires that business leaders recognize, as Harvard Business School explains, that they “have a responsibility to do more than simply maximize profits for shareholders and executives. Rather, they have a social responsibility to do what’s best – not just for their companies, but for people, the planet, and society at large.”\nThe CSR movement really took off about 40 to 50 years ago when businesses realized that they could carve out a niche and attract investment from people who wanted to make money and stay true to their values. Ben & Jerry’s was founded in 1978 during the heyday of CSR, by Greenfield and Ben Cohen.\nIt was upfront about the issues it cared about and the values it sought to promote. The list was long, but it included racial justice, refugee rights, climate, LGBTQ+ rights and democracy.\nThe Association of Corporate-Citizenship Professionals traces the roots of CSR back to the 18th century. At that time, religious groups would not invest, and would urge their members not to invest, in businesses that did not advance their values. Those included the slave trade and businesses that supplied the instruments of war.\nFast forward to the start of the 20th century, when in 1928, the Pioneer Fund became one of the first mutual funds to promote socially responsible investing, which meant avoiding companies producing alcohol or tobacco, or promoting gambling. Almost a century later, the Business Roundtable included in its statement on the purpose of a corporation the following: “We commit to … supporting the communities in which we work. We respect the people in our communities and protect the environment by embracing sustainable practices across our businesses.”\nSome progressives have criticized CSR, describing it as a charade and a public relations tactic that left the profit motive intact and did not require substantial changes in the way companies did business. But Ben & Jerry’s did more than brand itself as interested in social justice and political equality.\nAs its 2024 lawsuit made clear, Ben & Jerry’s has wanted to take political stands even if it meant that it would lose some customers. A year earlier, in March 2023, as Newsweek reports, Cohen “shocked many” by speaking out against the US providing military aid to Ukraine.” (An ally said he opposed Russia’s invasion but wanted a diplomatic solution.)\nWhile from time to time, the company has been accused of not living up to its values, not surprisingly, conservatives have targeted Ben & Jerry’s for being “woke”. Some have tried to organize a boycott to protest what they see as its radical left politics.\nThat’s perhaps why Unilever apparently wanted to pull back Ben & Jerry’s activism.\nWhat we are witnessing now in the way of corporate acquiescence to the rise of authoritarianism is a familiar story. There are plenty of examples.\nTake Viktor Orbán’s Hungary. There, as the political economist Gábor Scheiring argues: “Since 2010 Orbán has been using the momentum created by popular anger at the failures of liberal policies to build up his own system: authoritarian capitalism. A system that is deeply illiberal but capitalist: private property and the profit logic still dominate, but the state bureaucracy and its institutions are subdued to the enrichment of the preferred national economic elite.”\nThere is ample evidence that Trump is succeeding in that same endeavor. That’s why the era of corporate social responsibility is over. Greenfield’s departure is just the latest evidence.\nAustin Sarat, William Nelson Cromwell professor of jurisprudence and political science at Amherst College, is the author or editor of more than 100 books, including Gruesome Spectacles: Botched Executions and America’s Death Penalty\n-",
        "Trump Family Gains Another $5B in Crypto Profits. Critics Call It Corruption.. Did you know that Truthout is a nonprofit and independently funded by readers like you? If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation.\nIn what Public Citizen called “the greatest corruption in presidential history,” U.S. President Donald Trump and his family added $5 billion in cash to their fortunes this Labor Day as his new cryptocurrency was opened to the public market.\nThe currency, known as WLFI, is owned by World Liberty Financial, a company founded by the president’s sons, Donald Trump, Jr., and Eric Trump. A Trump business entity owns 60 percent of the company and is entitled to 75 percent of the revenue from coin sales.\nAs the Wall Street Journal reported Monday:\nGet our free emails\nThe trading debut was most likely the biggest financial success for the president’s family since the inauguration…\nWLFI is likely now the Trumps’ most valuable asset, exceeding their decades-old property portfolio. While the president’s family has continued to pursue property deals around the world since taking office, the fast-moving crypto business has had the biggest early impact.\nCrypto is now the dominant source of Trump’s wealth. As an investigation by the anti-corruption group Accountable.US found last month, “President Trump’s net worth could roughly be $15.9 billion, with about $11.6 billion in uncounted crypto assets,” meaning that the digital currencies now make up 73 percent of his total net worth.\nIn addition to the tokens owned by World Liberty Financial, it found that two Trump-affiliated companies owned 80 percent of the $TRUMP meme coin as of May and had collected over $324 million in fees since Trump took office in January.\nMeanwhile, Trump Media, which owns his online platform Truth Social, bought $2 billion worth of Bitcoin in July and reserved another $300 million in Bitcoin options.\nAs America’s self-proclaimed “first crypto president,” Trump has sought to curb regulations against the volatile financial assets.\nIn July, Trump signed the GENIUS Act, which purports to establish the U.S.’s first regulatory framework for crypto. However, critics noted that the law designated so-called “stablecoins,” of which Trump owns many, as “commodities” rather than “securities,” allowing them to face much looser oversight.\nThough the bill passed with support from over 100 Democrats, Rep. Maxine Waters (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, warned that the bill “legitimizes Trump actively building the most corrupt self-dealing crypto environment this country has ever seen.”\nRep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) described Trump’s latest $5 billion windfall as “blatantly corrupt and a brazen abuse of power.”\n“The current occupant of the White House,” she said, “is putting personal profit above the people, using his power to illegally line the pockets of his family and billionaire friends while hanging everyday families out to dry by ripping away their healthcare, food assistance, raising the cost of consumer goods, gutting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and more.”\nWhile cryptocurrency is often billed as an asset available to everyone that levels the playing field of the finance world, in practice, its ownership is largely concentrated among the wealthiest Americans. According to a Harris poll published in April, nearly half of all crypto owners have a yearly income of over $150,000, putting them in the wealthiest 10% of the country.\n“Your family gets higher energy prices and cuts to healthcare. [Trump’s] family gets billions,” said Rep. Greg Casar (D-Texas), the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. “Corruption, plain and simple.”\nSen. Patty Murray (D-Wash), a strong advocate for crypto regulation, said that such blatant profiting from the presidency makes Trump “easily the most corrupt president in our country’s history,” and emphasized that “Republicans in Congress are not lifting a single finger to exercise basic oversight.”\nAccording to data from OpenSecrets, just three crypto industry-backed political action committees (PACs) poured over $133 million into the 2024 election. Though they spent the majority of that money supporting Republicans, nearly 40 percent of it went to Democrats.\nBut although all this money helped to buy what Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong called \"America's most pro-crypto Congress ever,\" according to Reuters, just 3 percent of legislators in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate own these assets themselves, including Sens. Dave McCormick (R-Pa.) and Tim Sheehy (R-Mon.), as well as Reps. Nick Begich (R-Ark.) and Mike Collins (R-Ga.).\nBut Trump's profiteering far exceeds the crypto holdings of every congressperson put together.\n\"We have only seen the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the damage that this corruption will inflict on the American people,\" said Bartlett Naylor, a financial reform advocate with Public Citizen. \"The impact of attempts by the Trump family and others to buy and sell politics and politicians will continue to ricochet.\"\nKeep the press free. Fight political repression.\nTruthout urgently appeals for your support. Under pressure from an array of McCarthyist anti-speech tactics, independent journalists at Truthout face new and mounting political repression.\nWe rely on your support to publish journalism from the frontlines of political movements.

        "The American system is badly broken | Bernie Sanders. Let’s take a deep breath and, for one moment, forget about Donald Trump, Jimmy Kimmel, the UN, Charlie Kirk, Gaza, a government shutdown and the other crises that we face.\nLet’s talk instead about the reality which the corporate-controlled media and the corporate-controlled political system don’t talk about very much.\nWhat we are witnessing right now is the rise of two Americas. One for the billionaire class. And one for everybody else.\nIn one America, the richest people are becoming obscenely richer and have never, ever had it so good. That America is overflowing with unimaginable wealth, greed and opulence that makes the Gilded Age seem very modest.\nAnd then there is a second America – an America where a majority of people live paycheck to paycheck, struggling to secure the very basic necessities of life – food, healthcare, housing and education.\nThe simple truth is that never before in our history have so few had so much wealth and power while so many live in economic desperation.\nIn the first America, one man – Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, worth more than $480bn, owns more wealth than the bottom 52% of American households. After spending $290m to put Trump back into the White House, Musk has become more than $180bn richer since election day. That’s a pretty good return on his investment.\nBut that’s apparently not good enough for Musk. In order to keep him “motivated” as CEO, Tesla’s board proposed giving him a $1tn pay package if he meets certain goals. A trillion dollars.\nJeff Bezos, the fourth wealthiest person in the world, has a fortune of $233bn. He can sail to Venice on his $500m yacht for his reported $50m wedding, where he gave his wife a $3m-$5m ring – because, among other things, his effective tax rate is just a reported 1.1%.\nMark Zuckerberg, the third richest person in the world, is worth $258bn. He has spent $110m to buy 11 homes in Palo Alto, California, to create his own private compound, and another $270m for more than 2,300 acres in Hawaii with a 5,000 sqft underground bunker and three yachts reportedly worth more than $530m.\nLarry Ellison, the second wealthiest person in the world – worth $377bn – recently became nearly $100bn richer in a single day. He owns a private island in Hawaii and a fleet of jets, and now he’s reportedly trying to buy up major media companies such as Warner Bros and CNN.\nTogether, these four men alone are worth more than $1.3tn. But it’s not just them. The top 1% now owns more wealth than the bottom 93%.\nThe 1% lives in a world completely removed from ordinary Americans. They don’t ride overcrowded subways to get to work or sit in traffic jams to get home. They fly on private jets and helicopters they own. They live in mansions all over the world, send their kids to the most elite private schools and vacation on their own islands. And, for fun, some spend millions to fly off into space on their own rocket ships.\nAnd then there is the other America, where the vast majority of our people live. For them, the economy is not just broken, it is collapsing. In this America, despite a massive increase in worker productivity, real weekly wages for the average American worker are lower today than they were more than 52 years ago.\nIn this America, people are unable to afford a doctor’s visit (if they’re lucky enough to find one); are paying over half of their limited incomes on rent or a mortgage; and are unable to afford the outrageous cost of childcare or send their kids to college. In this America, the price of vegetables, fruit and other healthy foods is beyond the budget for many.\nFor most Americans, the system is not just broken, it is collapsing and is increasingly resembling life in the third world.\nEveryone needs healthcare. Yet today, more than 85 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured – a number that will rise by at least 15 million under Trump’s so-called big, beautiful bill.\nEveryone needs housing. Yet today, nearly 800,000 Americans are homeless and more than 20m households pay more than 50% of their limited incomes on rent or a mortgage. Since 2000, average rents have more than doubled and the median price of a home has soared to more than $435,000.\nEveryone needs a decent education. Yet today, our childcare system is broken and wildly expensive. Many of our public schools are dilapidated with teachers underpaid and underappreciated, and American students are falling behind in math, science and reading compared with their international peers. College education is unaffordable for millions and vocational schools fail to train the workers we desperately need.\nEveryone needs a secure retirement. Yet, nearly half of older workers have no retirement savings and no idea how they will ever retire with any shred of dignity or respect. Meanwhile, 22% of seniors are trying to survive on an income of less than $15,000 a year.\nEnough is enough.\nAs supreme court justice Louis Brandeis said in 1933: “We can have democracy in this country or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of the few, but we cannot have both.”\nThat warning is even more relevant today.\nIn this pivotal moment in American history, we must create a government and an economy that works for all, or we will continue sliding into oligarchy – where the billionaire class controls our government, our economy and our future.\nLet me say to my fellow Americans: I know day-to-day life can take a toll, but we must not allow ourselves to fall into despair. If we do not allow ourselves to be divided up by Trump and his oligarch allies, we can change the path we are on.\nThe choice is clear. Let’s stand together for democracy and justice.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

        "AI-cloning of Lara Croft’s Voice Has ‘Tomb Raider’ Fans and Actors up in Arms. A lifelong fan of \"Tomb Raider,\" French gamer Romain Bos was on tenterhooks when an update of the popular video game went online in August.\nBut his excitement quickly turned to anger.\nThe gamer's ears — and those of other \"Tomb Raider\" fans — picked up something amiss with the French-language voice of Lara Croft, the game’s protagonist.\nIt sounded robotic, lifeless even — shorn of the warmth, grace and believability that French voice actor Françoise Cadol has given to Croft since she started playing the character in 1996.\nGamers and Cadol herself came to the same conclusion: A machine had cloned her voice and replaced her.\n\"It's pathetic,\" says Cadol, who straight away called her lawyer. \"My voice belongs to me. You have no right to do that.\"\n\"It was absolutely scandalous,\" says Bos. \"It was artificial intelligence.\"\nAI encroaching ‘everywhere’\nAspyr, the game developer based in Austin, Texas, didn’t respond to e-mailed questions from The Associated Press. But it acknowledged in a post last week on its website that what it described as \"unauthorized AI generated content\" had been incorporated into its Aug. 14 update of \"Tomb Raider IV–VI Remastered\" that angered fans.\n\"We’ve addressed this issue by removing all AI voiceover content,\" Aspyr's post said. \"We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.\"\nStill, the affair has triggered alarms in the voiceover community, with campaigners saying it's a sobering example of dangers that AI poses to human workers and their jobs.\n\"If we can replace actors, we’ll be able to replace accountants, and a whole range of other professions that could also be automated,\" says Patrick Kuban, a French-language voice actor who is also a co-president of United Voice Artists, an international federation of voiceover artists.\n\"So we need to ask ourselves the right questions: How far should we go, and how do we regulate these machines?\"\nHollywood has seen similar concerns, with video game performers striking for 11 months for a new contract this year that included AI guardrails.\n\"This is happening pretty much everywhere. We’re getting alerts from all over the world — from Brazil to Taiwan,\" Kuban said in an Associated Press interview.\n\"Actors’ voices are being captured, either to create voice clones — not perfect ones — but for illicit use on social media by individuals, since there are now many apps for making audio deepfakes,\" Kuban said.\n\"These voices are also being used by content producers who aren’t necessarily in the same country,\" he said. \"So it’s very difficult for actors to reclaim control over their voices, to block these uses.\"\nCadol's ‘Voice Guardians’\nCadol says that within minutes of the release of the \"Tomb Raider\" update, her phone began erupting with messages, emails and social media notifications from upset fans.\n\"I took a look and I saw all this emotion — anger, sadness, confusion. And that's how I found out that my voice had been cloned,\" she said in an AP interview.\nCadol says 12 years of recording French-language voiceovers for Lara Croft — from 1996 to 2008 — built an intimate bond with her fans. She calls them the \"guardians\" of her work.\nOnce the initial shock subsided, she resolved to fight back. Her Paris lawyer, Jonathan Elkaim, is seeking an apology from Aspyr and financial redress.\nGrammar error\nIn the update, new chunks of voiceover appear to have been added to genuine recordings that Cadol says she made years ago.\nMost notably, fans picked up on one particularly awkward segment. In it, a voice instructs players how to use their game controllers to make Lara Croft climb onto an obstacle, intoning in French: \"Place toi devant et appuyez sur avancer\" — Stand in front and press \"advance’.\"\nNot only does it sound clunky, but it also rings as grammatically incorrect to French speakers, mixing up the polite and less polite forms of language that they use, depending on who they're addressing.\nGamers were up in arms. Bos posted a video on his YouTube channel that same evening, lamenting: \"It’s half Françoise Cadol, half AI. It’s horrible! Why have they done that?\"\n\"I was really disgusted,\" the 34-year-old said in an AP interview. \"I grew up with Françoise Cadol's voice. I've been a ‘Tomb Raider’ fan since I was young kid.\"\n\"Lara Croft is a bit — how should I say — a bit sarcastic at times in some of her lines. And I think Françoise played that very, very well,\" he said.\n\"That’s exactly why now is the time to set boundaries,\" he added. \"It’s so that future generations also have the chance to experience talented actors.\"",
        "Google is revamping its Chrome browser for the AI era. Google said it will roll out a raft of changes to Chrome, turning it into an AI-first browser.\n-\nChrome is a key part of Google's search business and the leading browser on the market.\n-\nThe changes, which include a new AI agent, fit into a broader shift happening with Google Search.\n-\nFor years, Google has used its Chrome browser to expand and retain its dominance in search. Now, it wants to do the same for AI.\nThe company announced on Thursday that it plans to supercharge its Chrome browser with a raft of new AI features, including AI agents that will complete tasks for you, as it transitions one of its key products for the AI era.\nGoogle is also putting AI Mode — its more conversational take on traditional Google Search — right into the address bar via something it's calling the \"omnibox.\" This will allow users to run searches in AI Mode without leaving the page they're on.\nThe updates fit into a broader shift happening at Google, which is transforming its search business into one led by AI. In a blog post announcing the new updates, Google Chrome vice president Parisa Tabriz described the changes as \"fundamentally changing the nature of browsing.\"\nGoogle will also put its Gemini AI assistant right into the browser. You can ask it questions, and it can see everything on the page as well as the content in other browser tabs. Google made this feature available earlier this year for paid subscribers, but now it will be available for free.\nGoogle says Gemini will also remember past web pages you've visited and integrate with several of the company's other services, such as YouTube and Google Calendar.\nReleased in 2008, Google Chrome has grown into a crucial surface for the company's Search business. Holding around 70% of the global browser market share, per Statcounter, Chrome is by far the leading browser. It also became a focal point of the recent antitrust suit brought against Google by the Justice Department, which proposed the company be forced to divest its browser business — something the judge ultimately decided not to do.\nChrome helps Google not just point more users to Search, but soak up that crucial data that helps it improve its search engine. By putting its core AI features, such as AI Overviews, into the browser, Google has an opportunity to create a similar flywheel for its AI products.\nAI agents come to the browser\nPerhaps the most intriguing update announced by Google this week is one that won't be immediately available. The company promises it will roll out soon.\nThere's been much buzz about AI agents, which, in theory, can complete all sorts of tasks autonomously. Google will debut its own agent in Chrome, which the company says can do things such as fill an Amazon shopping basket, write an email, or copy and paste information from one webpage to a document.\nGoogle teased its AI agent experience last year under the name \"Project Mariner.\" It's come a long way since. For example, it can now work in the background, so you can get on with other tasks as it gets busy writing that email or filling your Amazon shopping cart. It will, however, interrupt you if it needs to clarify something — say, whether Braeburn or Pink Lady is your apple of choice.\nThe agent will also stop before what Google considers an \"irreversible\" action, said Google Chrome product director Charmaine D'Silva during a press roundtable on Wednesday. That means not checking out on Amazon or hitting \"send\" on the email without your explicit approval.\n\"The nice part about it happening locally is that we are able to ask clarifying questions and hand it over seamlessly to the user, too,\" said D'Silva.\nOpenAI launched a similar feature this year called ChatGPT Agent, but it's in its infancy, prone to glitches, and not entirely reliable. Google is watching its AI rivals closely and says it wants its AI agent to be more robust when it launches.\n\"Our hope, by the time this gets to users, is that we've done away with many of those potential snafus,\" said Mike Torres, Google Chrome's VP of Product.\nHave something to share?

        "In just one year, Google turns AI setbacks into dominance. Caught off guard by ChatGPT and mocked for early blunders with its own generative artificial intelligence efforts, Google has pulled off a dramatic turnaround in just one year, becoming a major player in consumer-facing AI.\n“The market had written off Alphabet in the AI race,” Matt Britzman, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said of Google’s parent company. “That was short-sighted.”\nIn March 2023, Google hastily launched its version of ChatGPT, called Bard, four months after the original shook the world.\nDuring its launch event, Bard made an error answering a question about the James Webb telescope, drawing ridicule from viewers tuning in from around the world.\nSeveral analysts subsequently downgraded their recommendations of Alphabet, worried that ChatGPT would eat into the Google search engine’s generation-long dominance of the internet.\nA year later, in May 2024, the Mountain View, California giant unveiled AI Overviews, a feature integrated into Google Search that again caused online ridicule after recommending a glue pizza recipe and eating a rock a day in answers to queries.\nDespite massive investments in AI technology for over a decade — acquiring the DeepMind lab in 2014 and producing high-level research publications that inspired the ChatGPT phenomenon — Google kept stumbling.\nMuch of Google’s AI development “focused on powering its platforms rather than delivering services directly to consumers,” said Ben Wood, an analyst at CCS Insight.\nTed Mortonson, an analyst at financial services firm Baird, said Google leadership was caught “flat-footed” and had grown “too complacent” about their AI advantage.\n– Turnaround trajectory –\nAmid the crisis, change was afoot. Google co-founder Sergey Brin was seen back at the Googleplex, and the company undertook a drastic internal reorganization.\nIn spring 2024, AI developers were consolidated under a single Google DeepMind banner with Nobel Prize winner Demis Hassabis put in charge.\n“It took us time to bring these teams together,” CEO Sundar Pichai explained on the “Lex Fridman Podcast” in early June.\nGoogle also needed time to deploy its new in-house AI chips, the TPUs (Tensor processing units), essential to the company’s ambitions.\nBut “I could see, internally, the trajectory we were on,” he said.\nDespite the “glue pizza” missteps, or hallucinations in AI parlance, Overviews marked the first step in Google’s turnaround.\nNext came the commercial launch of NotebookLM — a digital document tool that can synthesize uploaded content into easy-to-understand writing or even a chatty podcast.\nAt Google’s developer conference in May 2025, the company unveiled video generation tool Veo 3, whose precision and consistency made a big splash, along with AI Mode, a feature that completed the transformation of search engine into ChatGPT-style chatbot.\nAugust brought a new version of the Pixel smartphone, whose AI enables 100x zoom and real-time translation. Mid-September saw the launch of video generation on YouTube.\n“Today’s tools, especially from Google, can be used in the real world, as opposed to just being developer conference demos,” emphasized Avi Greengart of Techsponential.\nWith Pixel, “Google is in pole position in AI equipment,” said Wood.\nGoogle drove the point home with its image editing program integrated into Gemini, informally called Nano Banana, which became such a sensation that Gemini topped ChatGPT in iPhone downloads for the first time earlier this month.\nThe outlook brightened further for Google when it avoided having to sell its Chrome browser — a government demand in its search monopoly trial that was rejected by a federal judge in early September.\nSignaling the shift, Apple is reportedly considering using Gemini for its overhaul of AI voice assistant Siri, according to Bloomberg.\nA partnership with the iPhone giant would hand Google a new revenue stream, though monetizing its AI “is still somewhat of a question mark,” said Greengart.\n“Google is playing the long game,” said Wood. “It knows that right now, it needs to offer free services to get consumers engaged with Gemini. However, in the longer term, it’s hoping this can be turned into a substantial revenue stream.”"

        "U.S. high school students continue to lose ground in math and reading, as yearslong decline persists. Annie Ma, Associated Press\nAnnie Ma, Associated Press\nLeave your feedback\nWASHINGTON (AP) — A decade-long slide in high schoolers’ reading and math performance persisted during the COVID-19 pandemic, with 12th graders’ scores dropping to their lowest level in more than 20 years, according to results released Tuesday from an exam known as the nation’s report card.\nEighth-grade students also lost significant ground in science skills, according to the results from the National Assessment of Education Progress.\nREAD MORE: Judge strikes down Education Department guidance against school diversity programs\nThe assessments were the first since the pandemic for eighth graders in science and 12th graders in reading and math. They reflect a downward drift across grade levels and subject areas in previous releases from NAEP, which is considered one of the best gauges of the academic progress of U.S. schools.\n“Scores for our lowest-performing students are at historic lows,” said Matthew Soldner, the acting commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics. “These results should galvanize all of us to take concerted and focused action to accelerate student learning.”\nWhile the pandemic had an outsize impact on student achievement, experts said falling scores are part of a longer arc in education that cannot be attributed solely to COVID-19, school closures and related issues such as heightened absenteeism. Educators said potential underlying factors include children’s increased screen time, shortened attention spans and a decline in reading longer-form writing both in and out of school.\nThe dip in reading scores appeared alongside a shift in how English and language arts are taught in schools, with an emphasis on short texts and book excerpts, said Carol Jago, associate director of the California Reading and Literature Project at UCLA. As a high school English teacher 20 years ago, Jago said it was common for her high school students to read 20 books over the course of a year. Now, some English classes are assigning just three books a year.\n“To be a good reader, you have to have the stamina to stay on the page, even when the going gets tough,” Jago said. “You have to build those muscles, and we’re not building those muscles in kids.”\nEducation Secretary Linda McMahon said the scores show why the Trump administration wants to give states more control of education spending.\nREAD MORE: Trump looks to expand school choice programs by repurposing federal funding\n“Despite spending billions annually on numerous K-12 programs, the achievement gap is widening, and more high school seniors are performing below the basic benchmark in math and reading than ever before,” McMahon said.\nHouse Democrats said the Trump administration’s efforts to dismantle the Education Department will only hurt students. The declines show a need for federal investment in academic recovery and educational equity, said Democratic Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia, ranking member of the House Committee on Education and Workforce.\n“Eliminating the very agency responsible for supporting public schools and enforcing civil rights protections of students will only deepen the achievement gaps identified by this assessment,” Scott said.\nThe test scores show more students are not reaching what would be considered “basic” achievement across subject areas, said Lesley Muldoon, executive director of the National Assessment Governing Board. While NAEP’s definition of “proficient” is a high bar, Muldoon said, it is not an unreasonable one, and it is based on what researchers believe students should be able to achieve by the end of high school.\n“These students are taking their next steps in life with fewer skills and less knowledge in core academics than their predecessors a decade ago,” she said. “This is happening at a time when rapid advancements in technology and society demands more of future workers and citizens, not less.”\nIn reading, the average score in 2024 was the lowest score in the history of the assessment, which began in 1992. Thirty-two percent of high school seniors scored below “basic,” meaning they were not able to find details in a text to help them understand its meaning.\nIn math, the average score in 2024 was the lowest since 2005, when the assessment framework changed significantly. On the test, 45% of high school seniors scored below “basic” achievement, the highest percentage since 2005. Only 33% of high school seniors were considered academically prepared for college-level math courses, a decline from 37% in 2019.\nThe high school reading and math assessments, and the eighth grade science test, are given less frequently than the biannual fourth and eighth grade reading tests, which were last released earlier this year. The new scores reflect tests taken in schools around the country between January and March 2024.\nThe gap between the highest- and lowest-performing students was its widest ever among eighth grade science students, reflecting growing inequality in the American school system.

        "Educational decline: U.S. high school students lose ground in math, reading. Educational decline: U.S. high school students lose ground in math, reading\nWASHINGTON (AP) — A decade-long slide in high schoolers’ reading and math performance persisted during the COVID-19 pandemic, with 12th graders’ scores dropping to their lowest level in more than 20 years, according to results released Tuesday from an exam known as the nation’s report card.\nEighth-grade students also lost significant ground in science skills, according to the results from the National Assessment of Education Progress.\nThe assessments were the first since the pandemic for eighth graders in science and 12th graders in reading and math. They reflect a downward drift across grade levels and subject areas in previous releases from NAEP, which is considered one of the best gauges of the academic progress of U.S. schools.\n“Scores for our lowest-performing students are at historic lows,” said Matthew Soldner, the acting commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics. “These results should galvanize all of us to take concerted and focused action to accelerate student learning.”\nWhile the pandemic had an outsize impact on student achievement, experts said falling scores are part of a longer arc in education that cannot be attributed solely to COVID-19, school closures and related issues such as heightened absenteeism. Educators said potential underlying factors include children’s increased screen time, shortened attention spans and a decline in reading longer-form writing both in and out of school.\nThe dip in reading scores appeared alongside a shift in how English and language arts are taught in schools, with an emphasis on short texts and book excerpts, said Carol Jago, associate director of the California Reading and Literature Project at UCLA. As a high school English teacher 20 years ago, Jago said it was common for her high school students to read 20 books over the course of a year. Now, some English classes are assigning just three books a year.\n“To be a good reader, you have to have the stamina to stay on the page, even when the going gets tough,” Jago said. “You have to build those muscles, and we’re not building those muscles in kids.”\nEducation Secretary Linda McMahon said the scores show why the Trump administration wants to give states more control of education spending.\n“Despite spending billions annually on numerous K-12 programs, the achievement gap is widening, and more high school seniors are performing below the basic benchmark in math and reading than ever before,” McMahon said.\nHouse Democrats said the Trump administration’s efforts to dismantle the Education Department will only hurt students. The declines show a need for federal investment in academic recovery and educational equity, said Democratic Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia, ranking member of the House Committee on Education and Workforce.\n“Eliminating the very agency responsible for supporting public schools and enforcing civil rights protections of students will only deepen the achievement gaps identified by this assessment,” Scott said.\nFewer students show basic proficiency in math and reading\nThe test scores show more students are not reaching what would be considered “basic” achievement across subject areas, said Lesley Muldoon, executive director of the National Assessment Governing Board. While NAEP’s definition of “proficient” is a high bar, Muldoon said, it is not an unreasonable one, and it is based on what researchers believe students should be able to achieve by the end of high school.\n“These students are taking their next steps in life with fewer skills and less knowledge in core academics than their predecessors a decade ago,” she said. “This is happening at a time when rapid advancements in technology and society demands more of future workers and citizens, not less.”\nIn reading, the average score in 2024 was the lowest score in the history of the assessment, which began in 1992. Thirty-two percent of high school seniors scored below “basic,” meaning they were not able to find details in a text to help them understand its meaning.\nIn math, the average score in 2024 was the lowest since 2005, when the assessment framework changed significantly. On the test, 45% of high school seniors scored below “basic” achievement, the highest percentage since 2005. Only 33% of high school seniors were considered academically prepared for college-level math courses, a decline from 37% in 2019.\nThe high school reading and math assessments, and the eighth grade science test, are given less frequently than the biannual fourth and eighth grade reading tests, which were last released earlier this year. The new scores reflect tests taken in schools around the country between January and March 2024.\nAchievement gaps are widening\nThe gap between the highest- and lowest-performing students was its widest ever among eighth grade science students, reflecting growing inequality in the American school system. The achievement gap widened also in 12th grade math.\nThe scores also reflect the re-emergence of a gender gap in science, technology, engineering and math courses. In 2019, boys and girls scored virtually the same on the NAEP science assessment. But in 2024, girls saw a steeper decline in scores. A similar pattern occurred in state math assessments, according to an Associated Press analysis.\nSchools had largely closed the gender gap in math and science, but it widened in the years following the pandemic as special programs to engage girls lapsed.\nOn a NAEP survey of students, a shrinking percentage of eighth grade students said they regularly took part in inquiry-based learning activities in the classroom.

        "Why the secrecy over consultants' role in school plans?. Education writer James McEnaney details the latest developments in The Herald's investigation of controversial plans for a new school on one of Scotland's largest islands.\nSince early 2025, The Herald has led national coverage of the complex, and continuing, saga over a new school for the Isle of Mull.\nOfficials want to replace the dated Tobermory High School – which includes an integrated nursery and primary school – with modern facilities. Current plans would see the all-through school replicated at a new location on the edge of the town.\nBut campaigners and community leaders have consistently called for a different approach. Rather than a single location, they want to see the secondary school split and built on a standalone site in a more central location. This would allow all young people on Mull to attend high school while living at home – at present, children as young as eleven from the south of the island are sent to board in Oban during the week.\nSurveys of people living on Mull have found that a split site is the preferred choice, and a local family has offered free land for a secondary school in Craignure, a few minutes’ walk from the island’s ferry terminal.\nThe council says that such an approach is unaffordable and undeliverable, although a full cost analysis of the split-site approach has never been released. Its handling of the overall processes around the school has also been heavily criticised by islanders and described as an illustration of “what happens when decisions are made too far away from the people affected.”\nIn October, the matter will be heard at the Court of Session in Edinburgh after a successful appeal for a judicial review of the council’s decision making. If successful, officials are likely to have to restart the process, which the council argues may put the entire project at risk.\nWho else is involved?\nBehind the scenes of the bid for a new school on Mull, a crucial role has been played by an organisation called Hub North, a consultancy organisation which “provides communities with project management services for the building of community projects in North Scotland.”\nHub North was involved in the initial bidding phase of the project, which was combined with submissions from four other local authorities under the title of the North Schools Programme.\nThe consultancy firm has remained involved in subsequent stages of the process. For example, a proposal document from August 2024 shows that a fee of £90,595 (not including VAT or “expenses”) was to be charged for work around community engagement and site selection.\nIn an attempt to understand the full nature of Hub North’s role, particularly with regards to consultation with the people of Mull and the way in which the site selection process was handled, The Herald asked Argyll and Bute Council to release copies of all communication between the two organisations since January 2024. The request was submitted on 14 July 2025.\nOfficials responded on 11 August 2025 advising that the request for information was being rejected in its entirety.\nThe council claimed that the request was “manifestly unreasonable” because it would impose a “significant burden” on the authority. Specifically, officials argue that it would take nearly 200 hours to process the emails held in their systems, of which there are more than 5,500. The cost of processing this is cited at more than £2500.\nEven without this pressure, however, they state that the request would, “in the opinion of a reasonable person, be considered manifestly unreasonable or disproportionate.”\nOfficials go on to accept that there would still be \"a public interest in being transparent and open\" and that the release of the requested information would \"would allow public scrutiny of the decisions it has taken in regard to the new school on Mull.\"\nHowever, they nevertheless find that the public interest in withholding the information outweighs the benefits of its release.\nREAD MORE\nMull campus 'paused' pending outcome of legal case\n-\nCouncil facing court date after Mull campaigners raise £50k\n-\nCouncil chiefs snub MSP-led discussion over school plans\n-\nRather than handling the request under Freedom of Information (FOI) legislation, the council has dealt with it under the rules governing Environmental Information Regulations (EIR) which allow for requests to be dismissed as “manifestly unreasonable”.\nAdvice from the Scottish Information Commissioner states that public bodies “should not use this exception lightly” and that it is designed to deal with the “rare occasions” when individuals do not “exercise their rights to information responsibly.”\nIn subsequent communications, Argyll and Bute Council Executive Director Douglas Hendry stated that the request was treated as an EIR because it “related to the provision of a new school facility on Mull.” However, a significant number of requests for information on the same topic, including some submitted on the same day, have been dealt with under FOI rules.\nIn response to one of these requests, following an initial attempted refusal, the council has provided a small selection of documents regarding the successful application for a Judicial Review of the council’s decision to locate the new Mull school in Tobermory. This disclosure includes communication from Hub North which had been withheld.\nWhat does the email say?\nAt 20:24 on 8 June 2025, Hub North’s Communication and Marketing Manager, Bob Dow, sent an email with the subject line ‘Tobermory Campus’. There were four recipients: the Chief Executive, Operations Director, and a Project Director at Hub North, as well as the Mull Campus Team Project Manager, who has an Argyll & Bute Council email address.\nThe message requests that the council worker, as well as one of the Hub North staff members, analyse a recently published crowd-funder that had been opened by community leaders seeking support for the Judicial Review. The appeal ultimately raised tens of thousands of pounds in just a few days.\nMr Dow asks that the page is checked “line by line” and that a list of “any inaccuracies, misinformation, and misrepresentation” are submitted to him. This, he adds, will allow him to “draft a social media response” in the council’s name to “rebut” any information deemed “incorrect.”\nThe individuals are also asked to “follow the same process” with respect to an article published by the Herald on 6 June 2025, which reported on council chiefs refusing to participate in an MSP-led discussion about the plans for a school on Mull.\nMr Dow states that he plans to “draft a letter of complaint” that will be issued in the name of the council, not Hub North. This, he adds, is in relation to the use of the term “community leaders”, which he says is false because the individuals in question “are a self-appointed protest group.”\nThe Herald understands four of the five members of group were part of a Mull Community Sounding Board established by the council. Two were community councillors, one represented a parent council, and one represented an island community trust\nThe council’s own website says that the Community Sounding Board was “formed of community representatives who are impacted by or have an interest in the proposed new Mull 2-18 Campus.”\nThe email concludes with Mr Dow stating that he has already spoken to the Argyll and Bute Council communication team about “taking a more robust stance” and that this “starts from here.”\nREAD MORE\n'Silenced and belittled' - islanders hit out over new school plans\n-\nAbandoned: students fears over island education let down\n-\nAnalysis: Council backed the status quo instead of the people of Mull\n-\nWhat do the council and the consultants say?\nThe council has already confirmed the contents of Mr Dow’s email on 8 June, but insists that no social media posts or press complaints were drafted. Regarding his ability to direct the actions of a member of staff working for the council, a spokesperson advised that they are in fact an employee of Hub North currently seconded to the council, and rejected suggestions of any improper behaviour.\nThe Herald has asked Argyll and Bute Council to explain why it is \"manifestly unreasonable\" for it to release communications with Hub North regarding the Mull school project, and why the request was treated in a different way to others on the same topic.\nTheir spokesperson responded that the council has already \"explained why this request, which identified potentially 5518 emails, was 'manifestly unreasonable', the language used in the relevant regulations, due to the significant burden on the Council the request would have.\"\nThey added: \"With regard to FOI and EIR requests. The request was dealt with in terms of the Environmental Information Regulations. When you raised this, we confirmed the reasons for this. We also advised that had it been addressed in terms of the Freedom of Information Legislation, then it would have exceeded the costs set out in the fees regulations. In either event the Council was entitled to withhold.\"\nWith regard to Hub North, the spokesperson said: \"They are not a private consultancy, they are a strategic development partner for the public sector focusing on community infrastructure and collaborating with 16 public sector organisations and the Scottish Futures Trust, to deliver projects that enhance local economies and services. Argyll and Bute Council is a shareholder of Hub North Scotland. They are also providing similar services for the four other Councils in the northern region who are part of LEIP3 programme.\"\nHub North did not respond to a request for comment."

        "Why so many mothers with young children are leaving the workforce. A growing share of mothers with young children in America are leaving the workforce, erasing gains made after the COVID-19 pandemic when working remotely became more common. Economics correspondent Paul Solman reports on the impact. Amna Nawaz: A growing share of mothers with young children in America are leaving the work force, erasing gains made after the COVID-19 pandemic, when working remotely became more common. Economics correspondent Paul Solman reports on the impact. Paul Solman: Nicoletta Barbera always saw herself as a working mother. She and husband Stephen (ph) worked for the U.S. Institute of Peace funded by Congress while raising two sons in Washington, D.C., until March. Nicoletta Barbera, Former Senior Program Officer, U.S. Institute of Peace: Overnight and with barely any warning, almost the entirety of the work force of the United States Institute of Peace was laid off kind of en masse. Paul Solman: DOGE-ed, including both Barbera and her husband. Nicoletta Barbera: The rug was really kind of taken out from under us because we not only went from two incomes to zero incomes. We went from having a family health insurance policy for us and our two young children to no health insurance. Paul Solman: Even moms who haven't been asked are leaving their jobs, especially in the back-to-the-office federal government. Misty Heggeness, University of Kansas: Those positions are predominantly held by women and, in particular, women with children, who often are willing to forgo wages in the private sector for more flexible work environments, work environments that historically the federal government has provided. Paul Solman: But now the share of working mothers with children under 5 is falling, says economist Misty Heggeness. Misty Heggeness: We have seen this continual perpetual decline in mothers' labor force participation. The first half of 2025, it shrunk by 3 percentage points. Paul Solman: In the pandemic era, remote flex time schedules helped push women's participation up to a record 78 percent. Once the flexibility vanished, however: Casey Puleo, Former Accountant: It was either going to be my kids or it was going to be my work, and I chose my kids. Paul Solman: Mom of four Casey Puleo juggled her job, accountant for the New York Giants, and kid care when she worked from home. Then: Casey Puleo: My employer was calling for everyone to return to the office. So that was really like the final straw for me. That was like the breaking point where I knew I couldn't do that. Working 9:00 to 6:00 in an office with no days from home, if school was closed, who was going to stay home with my kids? If she had to be picked up because she was sick, I was going to be the one to leave work to go get her. Something had to give. Paul Solman: She's now a stay-at-home mom. Casey Puleo: I felt forced. And in the position I was in, there was no other option. Paul Solman: Same for Jennifer Arenas-Cardenas, who depended on flex time to balance her job as a school psychologist with the needs of 3-year-old twins and a new baby. But last school year: Jennifer Arenas-Cardenas, Former School Psychologist: I was told to come at a certain time, to leave at a certain time, whereas, in years past, as long as I did my job within the hours that I was there, I wasn't really given too much grief over it. Paul Solman: Arenas-Cardenas loved her work, wanted to stay, but, she says: Jennifer Arenas-Cardenas: Trying to manage work expectations, trying to manage home life with twins and a new baby, it just -- it came to a point where it was unmanageable. Paul Solman: Could you not have put the kids in infant care or something like that? Jennifer Arenas-Cardenas: If we were to go that route, then my entire take-home paycheck would be going into their childcare. Paul Solman: And so you just figured, if it's going to be a wash financially, better that you be the parent than somebody else? Jennifer Arenas-Cardenas: Yes, exactly. It's going to eat a up my entire paycheck, then I might as well just stay home with the kids. Paul Solman: Made sense for her family, but it wasn't necessarily better for her clients. Jennifer Arenas-Cardenas: When I was able to do video calls with families or call outside of a typical school schedule, it worked out a lot better for families. I was able to accommodate them and meet them where they were at. Let's say, if a mom got off of work at 5:00, 6:00, I didn't have to make her come to the school at 3:30. I could accommodate my schedule to meet that family with where they were at. Paul Solman: Why do you think your school and other places, of course, eliminated hybrid work, if there was an advantage to the people they were serving? Jennifer Arenas-Cardenas: I think there's this misconception that if you can't see your employees and what they're doing, that they're not doing the job and that you have to be there at a certain time within an office, within a desk, and if you're doing that, you're productive. Paul Solman: There are real costs to the mothers like Arenas-Cardenas who've left or lost their jobs, says economist Heggeness. Misty Heggeness: When you step back from the labor force, it's not only something that affects you today. It is something that ripples throughout your entire lifetime earnings trajectory. Paul Solman: And there are broader effects beyond the mothers themselves. Jennifer Arenas-Cardenas: I'm not contributing to the economy. I'm not receiving a salary. I'm not able to pay taxes, as I have been consistently for the last 20 years of my life. And so, when you're taking that and you're taking many thousands of mothers who are going through this, it's going to create a ripple effect. Paul Solman: Last year, women only earned an average of 81 percent what men did, despite now making up the bulk of the college-educated work force. The motherhood penalty hasn't gone anywhere. Misty Heggeness: What happens is, as soon as they have children, you see women's earnings decrease significantly that first year or so, and then she never recovers. She never gets back onto the trajectory that she was before having children. Nicoletta Barbera: I have applied to over 140 jobs since early April and have not had success yet. Paul Solman: Nicoletta Barbera is technically still part of the labor force, since she's looking for work and technically unemployed. Nicoletta Barbera: I have been told by recruiters or colleagues at other organizations that hundreds and hundreds, if not thousands of people just like me are applying to these jobs. Paul Solman: And it's especially bad being in the D.C. area, rife with federal job cuts. Nicoletta Barbera: I have a lot of pressure and stress and feel a sense of urgency to provide for these children. I'm applying to jobs that are several positions below what I would normally be applying to, maybe even taking a 50 percent pay cut from what I was being paid earlier. But, even so, I'm not having success at finding a job. Paul Solman: Some jobs, she doesn't even apply for. Nicoletta Barbera: Where I assume that I won't be selected for a certain type of position because of my age or the fact that I'm a mother of two young children, I self-select myself out of positions, where maybe a man wouldn't do that. Paul Solman: Arenas-Cardenas chose to leave, but she'd love to be back working her old job. Jennifer Arenas-Cardenas: Even in my hometown here in Arizona, there's multiple school agencies throughout town who are looking for school psychologists. And I'm sure that there's multiple school psychologists just like myself who are kind of in the same boat. Paul Solman: Casey Puleo intends to be a full-time mom for the foreseeable future. Casey Puleo: I thought I would be able to have my flourishing career and be this amazing mom. I wasn't able to do that. Paul Solman: Wasn't able to do it, which figures to have economic repercussions for her and perhaps for us all. For the \"News Hour,\" Paul Solman.",

First, the organization descended into chaos after contestants said Miss USA 2022 was rigged. Then, in 2023, title holders Noelia Voigt and UmaSofia Srivastava relinquished their crowns — a first in the pageants' 72-year history — amid allegations of a toxic workplace environment.

        "Hibiscus tea: 10 health benefits of this superdrink. Imagine sipping a bright, ruby-red tea that is caffeine-free, pleasantly tart, and loaded with flavor – all the while, being unaware of the fact that you’re actually sipping on an elixir of health!\nThat’s hibiscus tea: made by steeping the dried calyces (the part just beneath the petals) of the Hibiscus sabdariffa plant.\nFor centuries, people around the world – from parts of Africa and Latin America to Southeast Asia – have used hibiscus tea not only for its taste but for its apparent healing powers. Recently, scientists are discovering that many of those traditional health claims have solid evidence behind them.\nHealth experts now call hibiscus tea a “superdrink” because it seems to benefit many parts of the body. The drink is rich in antioxidants, plant compounds, and minerals, and many studies suggest it may help protect your heart, manage your blood pressure, support healthy cholesterol levels, assist with blood sugar, and more.\nIn this article, we shall dive deep into the health benefits of hibiscus tea based on research and science-backed data, learn how it works inside your body, what dose seems useful, and the risks you should keep in mind. Whether you want to add a healthier drink to your routine or already love hibiscus, this guide will help you understand why this tart, colorful tea deserves more attention.\nMultiple human clinical trials show that drinking hibiscus tea regularly can reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressure. For people with pre-hypertension or stage-1 hypertension, reductions of about 5-7 mmHg in systolic pressure have been observed after a few weeks of daily consumption. It may act similarly to mild blood‐pressure medicines through effects like mild diuresis (helping you lose excess fluid) and relaxing blood vessels.\nStudies show hibiscus tea may reduce LDL cholesterol (“bad” cholesterol) and triglycerides, while sometimes increasing HDL (“good” cholesterol). Lower levels of LDL and triglycerides are linked to reduced risk of heart disease. For many, this effect, combined with blood pressure-lowering abilities, makes hibiscus helpful in supporting cardiovascular health.\nHibiscus tea has shown potential to lower fasting blood sugar in humans and may help with managing type 2 diabetes. Some animal and human studies suggest hibiscus improves how the body controls blood glucose after meals. This makes it promising for people with prediabetes.\nHibiscus tea is calorie-free and may help with modest weight loss when combined with a healthy diet and exercise. Some research (mostly using more concentrated hibiscus extracts) shows it may reduce fat accumulation, improve metabolic health, and help reduce body weight or fat.\nThe tea is rich in anthocyanins and phenolic acids – these act as antioxidants. Antioxidants neutralize “free radicals,” harmful molecules that damage cells and contribute to aging and diseases like cancer. As per many studies, hibiscus tea also increases antioxidant capacity in the blood.\nBecause of its antioxidants and other bioactive compounds, hibiscus tea appears to reduce inflammatory markers. Inflammation underlies many chronic diseases, such as heart disease, arthritis, and possibly some cancers. Animal studies and small human trials show hibiscus can help reduce inflammation.\nSome evidence from animal studies suggests hibiscus extract protects the liver from damage caused by toxins or high-fat diets. It may reduce fat buildup and improve markers of liver function. While human evidence is less strong, early trials are promising.\nHibiscus contains compounds that seem to inhibit the growth of certain bacteria and fungi in lab (in vitro) studies. This suggests potential benefits for gut health or preventing infections, though more research is needed in humans.\nSince hibiscus tea is caffeine-free, it does not have diuretic effects like caffeinated teas. It can help with hydration. The tea also supplies trace minerals like potassium, calcium, and magnesium, helping fluid balance and supporting nerve/muscle function.\nTraditional uses of hibiscus include treating symptoms of PMS (premenstrual syndrome) and menopause. It has phytoestrogens, which can act like mild forms of estrogen. Some studies suggest it may reduce hot flashes or mood swings, though evidence is preliminary.\nWhile hibiscus tea is generally safe for many healthy people, there are some important cautions as well. Like all powerful herbs, it also comes with cautions. Not everyone should drink it in large amounts; some medical conditions or medications might interact with its effects. Studies usually suggest drinking 2-3 cups of hibiscus tea per day (roughly 16-24 ounces / about 500-700 ml) for up to 4-6 weeks. As for the timing, after meals or between meals works fine. As it’s caffeine-free, you can drink it in the evening without most sleep issues. In fact, some people prefer drinking it before bed for relaxation.\nDisclaimer: The information provided in this article is for general informational purposes only and should not be construed as medical advice. While hibiscus tea has been associated with various health benefits, individual responses may vary. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional before incorporating hibiscus tea into your diet, especially if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, have low blood pressure, or are taking medications for conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, or heart disease.",

This kitchen-friendly herb has been used for centuries in traditional medicine, and modern research is finally catching up.\nStudies suggest rosemary oil can stimulate the scalp, improve circulation, and even encourage new hair growth, making it a natural rival to pricey commercial hair products.\nThe best part? You don’t need to spend big money on fancy serums. With just a few simple ingredients, you can make your own DIY rosemary oil for hair at home. Let’s break down why it works, how to make it, and the best ways to use it.\nIs oil the biggest enemy of your hair?\nRosemary oil isn’t magic, it’s science\nHere’s why rosemary oil is good for hair and scalp health:\nBoosts circulation: When massaged into your scalp, rosemary oil increases blood flow. More nutrients reach your hair follicles, supporting stronger growth.\nStrengthens roots: Rosemary contains carnosic acid, which may help repair damaged tissue and rejuvenate inactive follicles.\nActs as a DHT blocker: Some studies suggest rosemary oil reduces the effects of DHT, a hormone linked to hair thinning and male/female pattern baldness.\nHelps with dandruff: Its antimicrobial properties can fight itchiness, flakiness, and scalp buildup.\nAdds natural shine: With consistent use, rosemary oil leaves your hair softer, shinier, and healthier overall.\nDIY Rosemary oil recipe\nWant to know how to make rosemary oil for hair growth at home? It’s super easy and budget-friendly.\nWhat you’ll need:\n½ cup carrier oil (olive oil, coconut oil, or jojoba oil work best)\n-\n3–4 sprigs fresh rosemary (or 2 tablespoons dried rosemary)\n-\nSmall saucepan or double boiler\n-\nClean glass jar with a lid\n-\nStep-by-step:\nWash and dry rosemary – Rinse fresh rosemary and pat it completely dry to prevent bacteria.\n-\nHeat carrier oil – Gently warm your chosen oil on low heat. Don’t let it smoke.\n-\nInfuse rosemary – Add rosemary to the oil and let it simmer on low for 15–20 minutes.\n-\nCool and strain – Remove from heat, cool, then strain out the rosemary.\n-\nStore properly – Keep your rosemary-infused oil in a glass jar in a cool, dark place for up to a month.\n-\nFor stronger oil, let the rosemary sit in the jar with the oil for up to 2 weeks before straining. Shake every couple of days.\nHow to use Rosemary oil for hair growth\nAdding rosemary oil into your hair care routine is simple:\nScalp massage – Warm a little oil, massage it into your scalp, leave it for 30 minutes, then shampoo. Do this 2–3 times a week.\n-\nMix with shampoo or conditioner – Add 5–6 drops of rosemary essential oil (or a teaspoon of DIY rosemary oil) to your shampoo.\n-\nOvernight treatment – Apply to scalp and ends before bed, wrap your hair, and wash out in the morning.\n-\nBlend with other oils – Combine rosemary oil with castor oil for hair thickness or argan oil for shine to create a natural hair growth serum\n-\nFrequently Asked Questions About Rosemary Oil for Hair\nDoes rosemary oil really regrow hair?\nYes, research suggests rosemary oil can stimulate hair follicles, improve blood circulation to the scalp, and may encourage regrowth in people with thinning hair. Results aren’t instant—most people notice changes after 2–3 months of consistent use.\n-\nHow often should I use rosemary oil for hair growth?\nFor best results, use rosemary oil 2–3 times per week. Daily use can sometimes cause scalp irritation or buildup, so moderation is key.\n-\nCan I apply rosemary oil directly to my scalp?\nPure essential rosemary oil is too strong to apply directly. Always mix a few drops with a carrier oil like coconut, olive, or jojoba oil. DIY infused rosemary oil is milder and safe to apply more generously.\n-\nHow long should I leave rosemary oil in my hair?\nYou can leave rosemary oil on your scalp for at least 30 minutes before washing, or use it as an overnight treatment for deeper nourishment.\n-\nCan rosemary oil help with dandruff?\nYes, rosemary oil has natural antimicrobial properties that can reduce itchiness, dryness, and flaking. Regular scalp massages may improve dandruff over time.\n-\nIs rosemary oil safe for everyone?\nMost people can safely use rosemary oil, but always do a patch test first. If you’re pregnant, breastfeeding, or have sensitive skin, consult your doctor before use.\n-\nFew things to keep in mind\nBefore you dive in, here are a few tips for safe use:\nPatch test first – Rosemary oil may cause sensitivity, so always test on your skin before using on your scalp.\nDon’t overdo it – Stick to 2–3 uses per week. Daily use can cause irritation or buildup.\nBe patient – Natural remedies like rosemary oil for hair growth take time. Expect visible results after 2–3 months.\nEssential oil vs. infused oil – Essential rosemary oil is very concentrated and must be diluted with a carrier oil. DIY infused rosemary oil is milder and safe to use more generously.\nSo, is rosemary oil good for hair growth? Absolutely. It’s an affordable, natural, and effective way to support stronger, thicker, and healthier hair. While it’s not an overnight miracle, consistent use can make a noticeable difference in scalp health and reduce hair thinning over time."

        "Indonesia's delayed new capital risks 'white elephant' status. A year after it was inaugurated, Indonesia's would-be new capital Nusantara attracts tourists and construction workers, but most of its architecturally arresting presidential palace and freshly built avenues sit silent.\nThe legacy project of former president Joko Widodo is battling a slashed budget, slowed construction and a deficit of interest from a new leader focused on social mega-projects.\nThat has raised questions about whether the city, carved out of the jungle to replace crowded and rapidly sinking Jakarta, will ever see its promised potential.\n\"The political will on IKN right now feels muted,\" said Dedi Dinarto, senior associate at public policy advisory firm Global Counsel, referring to the new capital's official name: Ibu Kota Nusantara.\nPresident Prabowo Subianto \"is clearly putting his chips on welfare instead\".\nJust over 1,000 city authority employees live in Nusantara, along with a few hundred more ministry workers and service and medical employees.\nThat's far short of Jakarta's 12 million residents, and the new city's goal of two million inhabitants by 2045.\nPrabowo mentioned IKN just once in his first state of the nation speech, and has slashed funding for the project.\nOfficial budgets show a cut from 43.4 trillion rupiah ($2.66 billion) in 2024 to just 6.3 trillion rupiah in 2026. The authority had requested more than 21 trillion rupiah for 2026's budget.\nSignificant foreign funding has also proved elusive despite overtures to allies in the Middle East and Asia.\n\"Prabowo feels that this is not his legacy. It's not his big push and he has more programmes that he wants to push,\" an official involved in the city's construction told AFP on condition of anonymity.\n\"I'm still 50-50 on it (being finished),\" the official added, saying the budget cuts mean \"a lot of things will not be completed\".\n- 'Your loss' -\nThe former president, known popularly as Jokowi, revived the long-proposed capital move when he won a second term in 2019.\nBut despite a rush to build, the city was not inaugurated as Indonesia's new capital on August 17 last year as expected.\n\"In Joko Widodo's time it was very fast-moving, now in Prabowo's time... it's not as fast,\" said Sofian Sibarani, the city's designer.\nJust 800 of the planned 6,600 hectares of the core government area have been developed on or prepared for construction, he said.\nNusantara officials are undeterred, and tout the city as Indonesia's future power centre.\nCity authority head Basuki Hadimuljono told AFP that projects in a smaller executive area housing the palace and ministries in the government core were \"already 97-98 percent\" complete.\nHe claimed Prabowo wants to move in 2028 before the next presidential election, once the legislative and judicial areas are finished.\nAs president-elect, Prabowo said he wanted to \"continue, if possible finish\" the capital move, but since taking office he has yet to express any plans to sign the presidential decree needed to shift from Jakarta.\n\"It would be signed after the legislative and judicial areas are completed\" in 2028, said Basuki.\n\"If you do not want to move here, or you have a doubt, it is your loss,\" he added.\nSome government employees have expressed reservations about moving to an unfinished jungle city, located around 1,200 kilometres (745 miles) from Jakarta.\nBut city employee Helena, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, insisted her unfinished tower block offers \"an amazing level of comfort\".\n\"And the facilities we get are more than enough,\" the 45-year-old told AFP.\nThe city now has three functioning hospitals, coffee shops, a toll road to nearby Balikpapan city and an airport waiting for commercial flight approval.\nA planned shopping mall and cinema remain unbuilt.\n- 'Really cool' -\nOutside the palace in the ceremonial plaza, dozens of tourists were taking in the promised new capital with gusto.\n\"I am happy and proud... IKN is really cool,\" said Ronald Telaumbanua, 38, who travelled from Sulawesi island.\nThe striking presidential palace, modelled after the mythical Garuda bird, is a draw for photographs, but the city's lush green centrepiece offers little else.\nBusinesses counting on a boom of arrivals say they are struggling.\n\"During the Jokowi era, there were many workers, and there were numerous visits. Almost every day was busy,\" said Abduh Rajab, 57, a snack seller near the developed city centre.\n\"My earnings have dropped significantly, by almost 60 percent. But I have to stay optimistic. I hope the construction will continue.\"\nDedi said former general Prabowo was likely to remain focused on flagship policies, such as offering free meals to children and pregnant women.\n\"That means IKN will not see breakneck development anytime soon,\" he said.\n\"Without strong momentum, it risks drifting into white elephant territory.\"\nsty-jfx/sah/rsc/jm\n(0) comments\nWelcome to the discussion.\nLog In\nKeep it Clean.

        "Asia’s gas utilities are politically shielded but economically exposed. The balance sheets of Asia-Pacific gas utilities may look steady, but the domestic politics behind them matter as much as the numbers a new report shows.\nFitch Ratings’ latest sector review, released this week in Hong Kong, offers up an initially reassuring headline in “Asia-Pacific Gas Utilities’ Financials Remain Strong” with most companies comfortably within rating limits.\nHowever, beneath that supposedly unrippled surface, regional disparities and shifting demand patterns, particularly in North and Southeast Asia tell a more convoluted story.\nMany of the region’s gas distributors enjoy the safety net of being government-related entities and are thus ‘protected’ to a large extent. Their credit profiles are, in reality, extensions of sovereign ratings rather than stand-alone assessments according to the report. This implicit guarantee explains why ratings are expected to remain stable in the near term as any potential investor in the region or around the world knows that Beijing, New Delhi, Jakarta and Hanoi will not allow their national power entities to stumble, let alone fall.\nStill, one name stands out on the Fitch report. Binhai Investment Company Limited, rated BB+/Stable, has little room to manoeuvre. Falling sales volumes and slower new connections are little-by-little eroding its financial buffer. Without stronger demand, Binhai’s stability depends less on fundamentals than on the willingness of Indian authorities to keep supporting it.\nAcross the region too, leverage is set to creep higher though. Fitch projects sector debt ratios to rise from 0.9x in 2024 to around 1.0x by 2027.\nThat increase reflects ambitious capital expenditure across the board, notably at India’s GAIL (currently rated as BBB-/Stable) and PetroVietnam Gas (BB+/Stable).\nGovernments in both New Delhi and Hanoi want their national utilities to extend infrastructure, secure supply and reduce dependence on dirtier fuels. In Vietnam this is particularly true with LNG related infrastructure projects rarely out of the news of late.\nAt the same time, purchasing costs reveal the region’s fault lines. Chinese utilities are enjoying an unusual tailwind of late, primarily on the back of an increase in domestic production, expanded storage on the east coast of the country coupled to higher volumes of pipeline imports in the past month that have driven costs down.\nIndia, too, is benefitting to some degree with Brent-linked pricing translating lower crude benchmarks into cheaper gas imports even with the ongoing trade battle with Washington and talk of increased tariffs harming relations with the US making daily headlines.\nIndonesia, however, is stuck on the wrong side of the equation according to Fitch. PT Perusahaan Gas Negara, now rated as BBB-/Stable, relies heavily on LNG purchases, and with global LNG markets still tight, its outlays are rising. In time, this will only serve to add to purchasing competitiveness across the region given Indonesia’s status as the biggest economy in Southeast Asia.\nWith ongoing political issues gripping much of the country and daily protests in major cities, Jakarta may well need to subsidise early to avoid further consumer discontent.\nFor now across Asia, with gas still seen as a stepping stone between coal and renewables – a position largely echoed by Fitch – it is more than likely that long-term demand will remain strong. But slowing near-term consumption raises questions and analysts need to look deeper at the role domestic politics is playing in regional capitals in propping up highly rated under-performers.",
        "Southeast Asia startup funding hits six-year low at USD $1.85 billion. Southeast Asia startup funding hits six-year low at USD $1.85 billion\nSoutheast Asia's startup funding market reached its lowest point in more than six years during the first half of 2025, according to new data released by DealStreetAsia in partnership with Kickstart Ventures.\nThe Southeast Asia Startup Funding Report: H1 2025 shows that equity investments across the region dropped 20.7% year-on-year to USD $1.85 billion, spread over 229 transactions. Both deal volume and value are at their lowest since the report's inception, as investor confidence was dampened by ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and increased scrutiny of governance standards.\nDespite the overall decline, certain markets and sectors demonstrated resilience. Capital deployed in the second quarter more than doubled that of the first quarter (USD $1.28 billion compared to USD $0.58 billion), an indicator that, while transactions remain muted, investors are targeting larger deals with businesses that demonstrate strong fundamentals.\nRegional realignment\nSingapore continued to dominate as the region's fundraising centre, securing almost two-thirds of total equity capital at USD $1.21 billion. However, the city-state also recorded its weakest half-year performance with 129 deals, representing a 13% drop compared to the previous semester and a 44% decline year-on-year.\nIndonesia, traditionally one of Southeast Asia's most robust markets due to its sizeable consumer base, experienced a sharp contraction with investment down 67% to USD $78.5 million. This resulted in Indonesia falling behind the Philippines for the first time, as Philippine startups raised USD $86.4 million, positioning the country as a regional exception.\nVietnam emerged as the standout market, with a 169% surge in funding year-on-year to USD $275 million, and the number of deals rising from 17 to 23. Malaysia also showed improved performance, with proceeds doubling to USD $196 million, due to several notable fundraises in the period.\nThe region also witnessed the arrival of new unicorns. Malaysia's Ashita Group raised USD $155 million at a unicorn valuation, Singapore-based Thunes garnered USD $150 million at a valuation of USD $1.42 billion, and Sygnum, a digital asset bank operating in Singapore and Switzerland, crossed the USD $1 billion mark. Southeast Asia is now home to 58 unicorn-status startups.\n\"Global macroeconomic uncertainty and heightened governance scrutiny are reshaping the way capital flows into Southeast Asia. The bar for younger companies has risen considerably,\" said Minette Navarrete, Founder and Managing Partner at Kickstart Ventures. \"Early-stage funding now demands sharper proof of capital efficiency, viable growth models, and teams that can be trusted for both market performance and good governance, while capital at the later stage is consolidating behind companies that have demonstrated resilience and scale. This creates a more disciplined environment for both founders and investors.\"\nInvestment stages\nInvestor caution was most apparent in the early-stage segment, with transactions up to Series B falling to a six-year low of 219 and proceeds dropping to USD $1.1 billion, markedly lower than the USD $4.54 billion peak in the first half of 2022. Investors appear to be prioritising start-ups that present clear paths to efficiency and profitability rather than rapid expansion.\nLate-stage funding, by contrast, showed renewed momentum. Though only ten late-stage transactions were completed in the first half of 2025, these deals generated USD $756 million - a 70% increase on the previous half-year. The median deal size grew to USD $60 million, suggesting that investors are concentrating their capital with scale-ready companies with proven business models and credible exit strategies.\nSectoral patterns\nPlaced under the lens of sectoral activity, fintech led the region with 57 deals totalling USD $631 million, although this still represented a six-year low in both deal volume and total value. Health tech saw a notable rebound to USD $108 million, credit largely to Nuevocor's USD $45 million Series B raise, while green tech completed 20 transactions despite a decline in aggregate funding.\nStartups focusing on climate solutions also retained momentum with 34 transactions in the first half of 2025, many of them targeting renewable energy, waste management, and low-carbon mobility. These \"sustainability-linked\" sectors stood out amid the weaker landscape, showing that investor focus on climate and health impacts remains despite more conservative capital deployment elsewhere.\nPrivate debt activity softened, with proceeds nearly halved from the end of 2024 to USD $490 million as lenders shifted their attention towards revenue-generating companies with greater repayment capacity.\nNext cycle outlook\nWhile the market's contraction presents challenges, some industry leaders argue that it marks a necessary recalibration for the region's startup ecosystem.\n\"The numbers tell us that Southeast Asia is not in decline, but in reset. Investors are no longer chasing growth at any cost, and founders are now challenged to build businesses that are disciplined, efficient, and resilient. The rebound in late-stage deal sizes and the emergence of new unicorns show that capital is still available, but it is increasingly directed toward companies that can prove their fundamentals and readiness for scale. This is a healthy recalibration for the region, laying stronger foundations for the next cycle of growth,\" Navarrete stated.\nAndi Haswidi, Head of Data Research at DealStreetAsia, highlighted the significance of detailed research for industry participants. \"This collaboration with Kickstart Ventures underscores the value of tracking venture capital with precision. Our hope is that the report serves as a practical reference for founders and investors, particularly as they plan cross-border growth, and as a reminder of the strength within Southeast Asia's startup ecosystem.\"\nThe report draws on a variety of sources, including industry data, regulatory filings, and proprietary research, and acknowledges that some figures may be revised as new information comes to light given the private nature of Southeast Asia's capital markets."

        "Sterilization, mysterious pain, and dismissive doctors: Why women turn to reversal surgery — and sometimes to RFK Jr.. RALEIGH, N.C. — It was her second time trying to reverse what was supposed to be irreversible. The first time, Maranda Bordelon saved up for the $1,500 deposit, then booked a surgery date a few months out, so she’d have time to cobble together the remaining $4,500 she’d need to undo her sterilization. But just before her appointment, her parents’ house burned down, and she couldn’t stomach not being there to help. The deposit was non-refundable. That was in 2020. This time, instead of seeing that same surgeon, a two-and-a-half-hour drive from her home in Marksville, La., she’d picked a clinic six states and nearly a thousand miles away.\nIt was Dr. Charles Monteith’s website that convinced her: hundreds of pages of testimonials, newborn after newborn, fat-cheeked, wide-eyed, caught mid-giggle or mid-wail. Many of them wore T-shirts that said, “I’m a Monteith miracle.” The families had come to Raleigh from everywhere, it seemed. Arizona, Iowa, Utah, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Florida. When they’d arrived, the moms’ fallopian tubes had been closed: burned or clamped or cut or obstructed with metal coils. When they’d left, the tubes were reopened, ready for fertilization. It would cost $7,500, plus travel. Bordelon had started saving up again.\n“We’re leaving here broke,” said her fiance, Kaleb Gentry, with a hint of pride, when they finally arrived in November 2024. “We’ve spent everything we had to do this.”\nShe was a nurse, he was a foundation driller, each one tattooed with the other’s name — and here was Monteith himself, familiar from YouTube, same black scrubs, same gap-toothed smile, giving them his pre-op spiel. “What makes you want a reversal?” he asked.\n“We got together after I’d already had my children,” Bordelon said. She was 27. They were both from Marksville, a speck of a city where cotton had given way to corn and soy, the fields carved out of the bayou. They had mutual friends, and he’d slid into her Facebook messages. She’d joked she was nothing to be fixated on, she had bad credit and a bunch of kids. He’d replied he had good credit and no kids. He took her bowling with four of his cousins. He seemed like such a catch, she wondered if he was a serial killer or something, why he was single.\n“Did you look into IVF at all?” Monteith asked.\n“I did a little bit, but I’d kind of rather do it the full natural way.”\n“I hear that a lot, ‘the natural way,’” Monteith said. “Having sex is more fun than getting stuck with needles.” Bordelon giggled. In some respects, theirs was a classic tubal ligation reversal story, the story Monteith heard most often: Tubes tied young, when she already had kids and thought she was done. Then she’d gotten divorced, met someone new who had no kids of his own, realized maybe she wasn’t as done as she thought.\nBut there was another reason she wanted this surgery, another reason IVF wouldn’t do. Ever since she’d had a segment of each fallopian tube removed, she’d been living with terrible pain. It would start a week before her period and linger afterward, lasting the better part of a month. She thought it was appendicitis at first; it sent her to the emergency room. Then it just became her new, unlivable normal. She kept having to leave her nursing shifts at the psych hospital, curl into bed, and wait for pain meds to kick in.\nPost-tubal ligation syndrome, as it’s known online, is a lesser-known instance of a now-familiar curse: a set of symptoms debilitating enough to unravel lives but inexplicable enough for many doctors to doubt it’s a syndrome at all. After all, tubal sterilization is among the most common forms of female contraception. Some 700,000 Americans get one every year. Per the medical literature, as surgeries go, this one is safe.\nThose with PTLS beg to differ — at least for some uncounted subset — and they point to their 15,000-member Facebook support group as evidence. The mismatch sends women on maddening pilgrimages in search of recognition and relief. The best remedy, many with PTLS say, is reversal: Almost like turning back the clock, reverting to your pre-sterilization self. In fact, the first time Bordelon had put a deposit down to have this procedure in Louisiana, she was a single mom with three small kids at home, not looking to have another; she’d just wanted the symptoms to end.\nThat odyssey can lead not only into the operating room, but also into a tug-of-war with mainstream medicine, which recently has drawn some — be it avidly or uneasily — into the data-distrusting orbit of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\nIs there evidence for a post-tubal ligation syndrome?\nA contested illness presents a catch-22. With data limited, definitions fuzzy, and causes uncertain, some doctors are unconvinced. But how to collect data when it’s hard to define exactly what you’re collecting data on? The strict stipulations and cutoffs that help make something studiable and diagnosable may well leave out some of the very patients who already feel brushed off. It’s true of long Covid, myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, and fibromyalgia, too. Each one comes with this secondary affliction: not just the symptoms themselves, but the rift between official medical knowledge and people’s accounts of what’s unfolding within their own bodies and lives.\nFor Amy Barnett, it began right after her tubal ligation, during the birth of her second child, with an electricity-like pain crackling from her belly into her legs. When she asked whether her surgery might’ve sparked this, the nurse said no. Doctors told her everything looked normal. She wound up in a wheelchair, unable to walk even a few steps to the bathroom. Eventually, fed up with Barnett’s mysterious disability, her OB-GYN refused to see her. She was accused of drug-seeking when she went to the ER.\nThe only plausible explanation she could find came from Google. When she looked up her symptoms — she would count around 32 of them — she happened upon a blog about PTLS affiliated with a Dr. Vicki Hufnagel. This had to be what she had. Only later would Barnett learn that Hufnagel was an anti-hysterectomy crusader who had lost her medical license in the 1980s amid a storm of lawsuits, accused of comparing herself to Galileo, botching procedures she claimed to have invented, and submitting fraudulent bills.\nHufnagel had denied those claims and sought, unsuccessfully, to get back her revoked credentials — but even decades after the fact, Barnett saw that any semblance of an association between Hufnagel and her own attempts to get her PTLS recognized would hurt her cause. She wanted the condition studied, legitimized, not further discredited. When she began setting up online support groups in 2011, and became a PTLS social worker of sorts, she was careful never to steer fellow sufferers toward anything Hufnagel-tinged. She knew that the outside world was already primed against them.\n“When you hear about it, you think, ‘OK, these are a bunch of kooky women, they’ve developed some sort of cult, and they’re just completely against tubal ligation.’ That’s not true,” Barnett said. “I’m all for being able to make an informed choice.”\nWhat doctors should tell sterilization-seeking patients about PTLS, though, is itself contested. They had to discuss risks — but where did responsible disclosures end and fearmongering begin? As early as 1951, there were statistical blips suggesting that some version of PTLS might be measurable in studies — but they were often eclipsed by findings suggesting it wasn’t. A 1998 review titled “Is there any evidence for a post-tubal sterilization syndrome?” reported a possible yes for women in their 20s who’d previously had menstrual issues — but a no for women over 30. A big New England Journal of Medicine study from 2000 found that women who’d had tubal ligations described more menstrual irregularities than those whose partners had had vasectomies — but significantly fewer instances of pain and heavy bleeding. A few more papers, and some doctors considered the question settled: The data showed no consistent link between sterilization and these symptoms.\nThat depended on what sort of data, though. Sufferers couldn’t help but see patterns in their stories — affecting only a small minority of women, perhaps, and so diluted in the wash of studies, but worth addressing. Even when researchers explicitly set out to address patients’ concerns — to bridge the gap between doctors with expertise in study design and people with expertise in their own bodily experiences — the community still felt dismissed. Barnett served as an adviser on a 2021 study, but ended up alienated. “Unfortunately, the scientists did not include most of the symptoms that we wanted to look at,” she said. It was the same vicious cycle contested illnesses are often caught in, academic medicine reaching for stricter criteria than patient groups. When the study came out, Barnett distrusted the results.\nThere was already plenty of distrust to go around, with doctors repeatedly telling those with PTLS that their illness was all in their heads, that they were depressed or suffering from personality disorders or merely exhausted. It was hard not to see, in such dismissals, a generalized shrug about women’s pain, and with it, a kind of critique. Motherhood is a medical and moral battleground, its every detail attracting judgment with an almost magnetic pull, people judging you for having too many children or too few, for breastfeeding or for not breastfeeding, every parenting decision a referendum on your worthiness and character. When Stacey Underwood, a real estate agent in North Carolina, told her doctor about her symptoms, his diagnosis was a maladjustment to having five kids, his prescription for a babysitter. “It made me feel like my role as a mother was under attack, like I was not good enough,” she said.\nSome found in Barnett’s Facebook group what mainstream medicine could not or would not provide. “Amy was amazing. She would message me. She would talk to me, answer my questions,” said Misty, who’d found herself using a walker at 38 and bleeding out clots the size of golf balls, and spoke on condition that her last name not be used. “I just felt like a vampire who finds other vampires at a convention.”\nTubal ligation reversal, a ‘dying art’\nTubal ligation reversal sits on the outskirts of American medicine, in a weedy gray zone, not quite shunned by the establishment, but not quite part of it, either. The guidelines are clear: Sterilization must be considered permanent. Undoing it is sometimes possible but never certain. Some 65% of reversals result in pregnancies, a 2023 analysis found, but the number can depend on age, health, and surgical methods used. For many, the success rates are moot. While ligation is typically covered by insurance, reversal almost never is, and thus is often unattainable. It suggests the judgy economics of just-desserts: You can change your mind, but you’ll have to pay for it yourself.\nHospitals offer the procedure, but the overhead expenses mean it can cost in the tens of thousands of dollars. It’s also become rarer since the advent of in vitro fertilization in the 1980s, which many doctors prefer. By siphoning out eggs with a needle through the vaginal wall, physicians can circumvent blocked tubes without surgery; by relocating reproduction to a lab dish, they gain more control over various sources of infertility, male or female. Some training programs no longer teach reversal at all. “It’s a dying art,” said Eliran Mor, a Los Angeles-area reproductive endocrinologist.\nAll this gives it a contrarian allure, creating a niche for businesses like Monteith’s. He relishes his outsider status. He’d spent his early career as a more traditional OB-GYN but eventually began to feel like a cog, and left to apprentice himself to an older reversal surgeon. When his mentor retired to open a medical spa, Monteith took over the practice.\nThat sense of being different from other doctors is an essential part of his spiel. The day before Bordelon’s surgery, he pulled up his website to show her how to send in a baby pic if the operation were successful. “You get pregnant, you let us know,” he said. “Under ‘testimonials,’ come down to ‘patient reporting.’” He scrolled and clicked. “The reason I put all this on here is that a lot of doctors don’t think this is possible, and they put the patients down.”\nBy his estimation, post-tubal sterilization symptoms are the reason for only about 5% of the 600 or so reversals he performs every year. Another 10% are motivated both by those issues and the desire for another child. The vast majority just wanted another child. But even that largest group has, in Monteith’s view, been alienated by mainstream doctors, who sometimes talk about medical decisions as if they took place in a sterile, mathematical realm, divorced from the tangled stories of people’s lives.\n“Most infertility specialists just think of this as a way to get pregnant,” he said. “So when they talk about IVF versus tubal reversal, they just throw out statistics. But those statistics are meaningless to a person who wants to undo a prior mistake.” His work, he knew, was part physiology, part symbol.\n‘I never got to plan to be pregnant’\nBordelon knew all about wanting a fresh start. She’d had her first child at 16, her second at 18. Soon, she was married, and her husband whisked her off to Mississippi to take an internship as a welder. She had two more kids, one at 19, another at 20. She’d tried all kinds of contraception — the pill, the patch, the shot, an IUD — but none had worked for her. Each time she’d found out she was pregnant, the news didn’t feel exciting. A tubal ligation seemed like the only option. She was far from home in a relationship that was foundering, her husband working nights. They hardly saw each other and had little to say when they did. “We were basically like roommates,” she said.\nWhen it appeared, her pelvic pain was layered onto all this isolation and heartache. Then, in 2020, her youngest died at 18 months old, of sudden infant death syndrome. His name was Hudson. Their love for him was what had kept Bordelon and her husband together; now, he was gone. They got divorced. Within a year, she was a working single mom, seeing specialists for a mysterious chronic illness, bringing her older kids to decorate their younger brother’s headstone for Christmas and Valentine’s and Mardi Gras.\nThough she didn’t know it at first, she represented a new life for Gentry, too. They’d been dating for a few months when she found out about his meth addiction. They were in the car, in search of corn-on-the-cob fabric for her daughter to wear in the “niblet pageant” at the Bunkie Corn Festival. They’d struck out at Hobby Lobby; she was using his phone to look up directions to Joann Fabric and Craft when she saw what looked like a message from a dealer.\nWhat’s this, she demanded.\nHe’d been meaning to tell her. It had started when his first wife had gotten cancer. He’d be up all night, caring for her, then head to the construction site in the morning, exhausted. A buddy handed him some speed to help. He’d gotten hooked — and still was when he first started spending weekends at her house. He hid his meth pills in Tylenol bottles. But he swore he’d been sober for a month, that she was the best thing that ever happened to him. He begged her not to throw him out.\nIt felt like a betrayal. She couldn’t believe there had been drugs around her kids. Then again, her times with Gentry had been among her happiest. She loved watching him with her children, how he took them fishing and squirrel hunting on the bayou by their house, the pride he took in them. Plus, she had noticed a change in him recently, his disposition less irritable, his body filling out. Maybe he really had kicked his drug habit.\nAt first, she brought drug tests home from work and made him pee in a cup. He did it willingly, almost joyously, excited to prove he was sober still. Eventually she stopped. All around were stories of people who’d been lost or who’d pulled themselves back from the brink. The memory of one buddy inked on Gentry’s hand, a guy who’d been sleepless for days on speed and died in a car crash at 21. Their pastor, who’d managed to kick meth and find God.\nGentry was the one who first brought up the idea that they have another child, maybe two. Bordelon had already tried to get a reversal as PTLS treatment. A specialist she’d seen more recently had suggested it as a possibility — and she felt a yearning for a baby, too. She thought about how all four of her pregnancies had been surprises, her mind kicking into a clear-eyed anxiety. “I wanted the full experience,” she told Monteith. “I never got to plan to be pregnant. Getting excited to test positive is different than, like, ‘uh-oh.’”\nThe sheer amount of effort they had to put in was a testament to how committed they felt. This time, it would be the opposite of unplanned. “The route that me and Kaleb took to have a baby means a lot more to me than just finding out I was pregnant,” Bordelon said. “We’ve saved money, scheduled a surgery, traveled across the country to this random doctor’s office in this random place.”\nHow PTLS symptoms can remap someone’s world\nThere’s a Google doc that gets passed around the PTLS community to help people find these “random” doctors — a crowdsourced cheat sheet for a hard-to-navigate realm. Some surgeons won’t perform reversals unless the patient is planning to have a child. Some will remove clips from the fallopian tubes but won’t look for them if they’ve become dislodged and wound up somewhere else. One doctor in Tennessee will only do reversals for married women. It’s a kind of TripAdvisor for those in search of a very specific sort of trip.\n“Believes in PTLS,” some entries say. Or: “does NOT believe in PTLS.”\n“BELIEVES IN PTLS-per his website but denied it in the past-approach with caution.”\n“Will accept patients with BMI over 40!”\n“Noted to be caring and understanding of PTLS symptoms- DOES NOT PERFORM REVERSALS”\nIllness can remap your world. What was once a daily activity now requires a calculus about conserving energy. The professionals who might’ve earned reflexive trust now seem hapless if not downright harmful. It can start with fallopian tubes and expand outward, to encompass everything.\nFor Barnett, what began with PTLS led to concerns about surgical clips, which case reports have found might spark an inflammatory response in a minority of people. She discovered her body contained them not only from her tubal ligation but also from previous gallbladder and thyroid surgeries. She flew to Raleigh for a reversal, to Austin for one clip removal operation, to Boston for another. She started another Facebook group and Google doc devoted to clip issues, advocating for surgeons to screen patients for metal sensitivities before any procedure. She wondered if PTLS might share some explanations with other contentious syndromes that seemed further afield but that were also hypothesized to stem from foreign substances in the body, such as breast implants, surgical meshes, or certain ingredients in vaccines.\nHer illness influenced her thinking more generally, too. In the lack of discussion about PTLS before sterilization, she couldn’t help but see the same erosion of informed consent that she saw in vaccine mandates. She wouldn’t post about that in her Facebook group. There’s a rule against “political, vaccine, or religious debates.” Still, it shaped her personal politics.\nIn 2024, you might say she was a single-issue voter, her issue being bodily autonomy. To her, Kamala Harris represented vaccine mandates, President Trump represented the overturning of Roe v. Wade. She couldn’t stomach either one. She’s a registered Republican who often votes Democrat, a woman whose religious beliefs disallowed abortion for herself but who knows there are obstetric scenarios unimaginable until you’ve lived them. She cast her ballot for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for president, knowing he couldn’t win.\nBut once he became Trump’s health secretary, her hope was tinged with unease. She liked his stance against artificial food dyes, his scrutiny of rare vaccine adverse events, his vow to fund research into the causes of autism. Yet some of his claims struck her as crazy. The myth that poppers, rather than HIV, caused AIDS, for instance. Plus, in allying himself with Trump, Kennedy had joined forces with the man who’d helped end Roe and spark an uptick in sterilization — to Barnett, a double whammy of women losing agency over their own bodies.\nIn her apprehension about Kennedy, it was hard not to hear echoes of her take on Vicki Hufnagel, the disgraced doctor whose websites helped Barnett to discover PTLS in the first place: a figure to be wary of, in spite of certain useful ideas. Here’s a man seen as a misinformation machine by many physician groups, making headlines for swimming in sewage-contaminated waters, a lawyer who has no medical license to lose. Some PTLS sufferers hated him; others were too sick to pay much attention. “Our community already faces intense skepticism from the medical system,” Barnett said. “The last thing our advocacy needs is to be undermined by political assumptions or for members to feel alienated over differing views.”\nYet doctors’ skepticism about PTLS drew others to Kennedy. At first, Kenna Kerr took the pain medicines, muscle relaxers, and antidepressants her physicians prescribed. She didn’t attribute her son’s autism to vaccines, because “only crazy people think that.”\n“I worked in the medical field. I believed in vaccination. I got flu shots. We made sure all of us did,” she said. It was the reaction to her illness that converted her. “When I brought up PTLS to one doctor after another, they told me there’s no such thing. I pretty much had to stop talking to them because it’s like, OK, you’re getting me nowhere, you’re getting me no help, you’re pushing medication on me but I’m not getting better, I’m getting worse.”\nHer fallopian tubes had been removed entirely, so she wasn’t a candidate for reversal, but she flew from Arizona to California to have the stumps reopened. Her symptoms dissipated — and she started to believe that Kennedy had a point in worrying about chemicals in the food supply and in embracing debunked notions about vaccines. She sobs at the link she sees between the immunizations she gave her children and her son’s autism. “What I went through with my sickness, how crap the treatment was through the medical system, it’s like my eyes opened,” she said.\nIn dismissing people’s pain, American medicine has helped usher in a kind of defensive dismissal, patients brushing away the entire edifice that doctors represent. The medical literature is clear: Again and again, studies have shown that vaccines do not cause autism. When PTLS patient Stacey Underwood was asked about all of that evidence, she said, “I just think that a lot of doctors are closed-minded. I was discredited for years because of the symptoms that I was having.” She believes that people with bad reactions to vaccines face the same disbelief. But if her symptoms weren’t real, how was it possible that she could get a reversal and see the vast majority of them disappear?\n‘I may not be able to repair this side’\nMonteith peered into Bordelon’s abdominal cavity. Usually, he is focused but relaxed in the operating room, chatting, joking, like a performer backstage at a show. But now, his voice took on an edge of seriousness. “She has adhesions to this tube that are pretty dense. I may not be able to repair this side,” he said.\nHe was about 30 minutes into her surgery. She was draped and anesthetized, the only part visible a tiny bit of skin framing a red hole. He’d sliced through her belly, separating layers of fat and muscle, an assistant widening the sides of the incision with a sort of metallic shoehorn. The right tube had been easy enough. It looked a bit like an earthworm as he maneuvered it — at once robust and pliable, squishier than you might expect for the passageway where egg had met sperm, forming a single cell that had then traveled down into her uterus, becoming an embryo, and, eventually, a child.\nHe’d found the two severed ends and snipped them open where they’d scarred shut, inserting a temporary stent into one side to keep it wide as he worked. Then he’d begun suturing — first, a stitch to hold the segments close, so that they could be sewn together as if merely mending a wound. He’d tweezered out the stent and put the finishing touches on the seam. “The tube is repaired,” he’d announced. “Now we just have to hope it heals open.”\nHer left side was more complicated. The tube and uterus were webbed with stringy tissue, gleaming pinkish in the lights of the operating room. These were bits of the apron that covers the abdominal cavity, made sticky in the scarring after her four C-sections. “Like wallpaper glued to a wall,” Monteith said.\nHe touched the webbing with a gloved hand. “I could take this down, but the deeper I go, the more chance we could have bleeding. I may get all this off, and find the tube is crap, so to speak, and I’ve done it for no reason,” he said. “I’m not trying to push it, we’ve repaired the right tube, it’s in really good shape.” By his own count, he’d only had to send one patient to the hospital because of complications in the last 10 years. He didn’t want Bordelon to be his second.\nHe’d had patients get pregnant after reconnecting only one tube. What that might mean for Bordelon’s symptoms was hard to say. She’d hardly talked about her pain in the pre-op appointment.\nIt didn’t seem worth it. He’d just made the announcement to the team, so they could amend the operative note, to specify that the surgery was no longer bilateral — “I’m not going to repair the left side. So this is going to be a right tubo-tubal anastomosis” — when he slipped a finger under the mat of pinkish stuff. Maybe it wasn’t as bad as he’d thought. In fact, that was something he could safely cut. He started in, the electrical scalpel giving off the strange plasticky smell of burnt flesh.\nHe began to chat again. “This helps restore her sense of fertility and of being a woman,” he said, as he reached deep inside her abdomen with pincers, threading sutures in and out, in and out. “Trying to have a child with him the natural way, as opposed to IVF, which is definitely more of a —”\nHe stopped himself. “Well, this is a process. I mean, this is surgery. I’m not kidding anybody.”\nHis suturing was nearly done. “Stent’s out,” he said, and the whole team answered in a chorus, “Stent’s out,” their way of check-listing every piece that went in, to make sure nothing foreign got accidentally left inside her body. He pulled taut a few last, delicate stitches — fine as the hairs on your forearm, the difference between a severed tube and, hopefully, a functional one — and then was ready to start closing her up.\nCan tubal reversal help with symptoms after sterilization?\nWould this work? In terms of restoring her fertility, the answer was uncertain, but the uncertainty had been officially clocked, pregnancy and live birth rates tabulated, separated out by age and sterilization method and reversal technique, bounded with error bars — the predictable unpredictability that medical science is built on. In terms of treating her pain, the uncertainty was anecdotal. Of the PTLS Facebook group members who receive reversals, Barnett said, “I don’t have any data to back this up, but if I were to give it a number, I would say 98% of them either improve completely or vastly improve — more than half of their symptoms go away.”\nWhy this might be was as mysterious as the biology of PTLS itself. Different phenomena might be at play in different bodies, but could present in a similar way. “We know so little about pain, and it can be so multifactorial, especially in the pelvis, where there’s a lot going on, and women’s pelvic pain is just such an understudied thing,” said Kavita Arora, an OB-GYN at the University of North Carolina and a sterilization researcher.\nTo her, some of that pain might have to do with women stopping birth control and their periods returning after a long hiatus. Barnett, though, points out that many with PTLS weren’t on birth control. Some scientists have wondered whether sterilization might disrupt tiny blood vessels, shifting both blood flow to the ovary and its production of hormones. But the data are mixed, with some studies suggesting there is an impact and others suggesting there isn’t. Why yet more surgery might help is unclear.\nOr it might have to do with what is known as retrograde menstruation: the idea that during menstruation, when blood flows out of the uterus through the cervix and vagina, some also goes through the passage of the fallopian tubes and out into the pelvic cavity. “When those passageways are blocked, it makes sense that there’s probably some pain and cramping there,” said Arora.\nThen again, in about half of Monteith’s patients who report these symptoms, he sees the tubal ligation site studded with buckshot-like dark patches: a classic sign of endometriosis. It’s a common and mysterious diagnosis, often thought to be caused by retrograde menstruation, those bits of blood and uterine debris triggering inflammation and terrible pain. In theory, blocking retrograde menstruation could help prevent this — but it’s possible that in some cases, something about sterilization might open an accidental fistula, a fissure in the uterine wall, allowing that tissue to escape and settle where Monteith finds it on reversal. But endometriosis wasn’t present in everyone. Bordelon, for instance, had none.\nDitto for surgical clips. A rare inflammatory backlash might explain some aspect of reversal: Removing the object the body’s reacting to might truncate the reaction. But why then would someone like Bordelon, whose tubes had been severed — no clips involved — experience PTLS, too? And why would those who’d had their clips removed but not reversals find less relief than those who’d gotten both, as Barnett has observed in her group?\nFor some patients, the symbolism of reversal is explanation enough, the rejoining of what has been severed. Some doctors, meanwhile, couldn’t help but wonder whether the placebo effect was sometimes involved. The literature describes a strange phenomenon: the more intensive a treatment, the better patients seem to feel. One study found that four daily sugar pills were associated with better ulcer healing than two. Injecting saline was better at treating migraine and hypertension than oral pseudo-medication. Sham surgery has been found to help with everything from torn knee cartilage to Parkinson’s disease. This might be at play in some PTLS patients, the intensity of the surgery itself therapeutic.\nBarnett rejects this idea. To her, it sounds dangerously close to labeling the syndrome psychosomatic. Yet those who study the brain circuitry involved in sham therapies disagree. “There’s no question that patients with Parkinson’s disease have a real illness,” said Matthew Burke, a cognitive neurologist and placebo effect researcher at the University of Toronto, who emphasized that he has no expertise in gynecology or PTLS. “But Parkinson’s patients are exquisitely placebo-responsive.”\nIn Barnett’s thinking, physicians don’t need any more excuses for not studying PTLS. She’s been dismayed to see the Trump administration slashing scientific funding: She wants scientists to keep delving into her condition, exploring its immunological, hormonal, and genetic characteristics. “I challenge them to look at our group specifically. This could be a great pool to figure out some questions that we’ve not ever had the answers to,” she said.\nEven those who in some ways are aligned don’t see eye to eye on everything. Monteith, whom Barnett considers an ally, isn’t sure about describing this group of patients as having a “syndrome.” That they have symptoms, however, is uncontroversial; to pretend otherwise feels untenable and unhelpful — a fact that you can’t dispute.\nA pregnancy, and a greater vigilance\nBordelon and Gentry planned their wedding around the Monteith miracle they were hoping for. Too soon, and she’d be recovering from surgery, too far out, and she might not fit into her dress, or might be at the sleepless, unceremonious whims of a newborn. “We’d both already been married, we’d both already had the big old wedding with the reception and all that other stuff,” Bordelon said. This time, they’d keep it simple, just their families and a few friends at the bridge in City Park in New Orleans, surrounded by sweeping palms and cypresses. They picked a date in March.\nNot long before, she discovered she was pregnant. Part of her was nervous: She knew that tubal reversal came with a higher risk of the embryo catching and implanting in the newly sutured tube, and she wanted to rule that out as soon as possible, before it became an emergency. But she was excited, too. At the wedding, she handed Gentry a gift bag, with the positive test in it, and a onesie that read “Baby Gentry.” He cried. A band paraded them down Bourbon Street. They ate nachos at the Hard Rock Cafe. Then, they went back to Marksville, Gentry back to drill shafts, Bordelon back to nursing shifts.\nThe pregnancy wasn’t ectopic: The ultrasounds showed it clearly in the uterus, not just one fetus, but two. She had not only dodged the risks of tubes healing closed and embryos implanting in the wrong place, but also, as far as she could tell, fixed her PTLS. She’d only had a handful of menstrual cycles before her periods stopped, but they’d involved none of the terrible pain she’d come to expect. She wasn’t sure what the problem was, biologically, but she figured it had to be related to her tube-tying: She’d never had issues before sterilization, they’d appeared right afterwards and then stopped once the surgery was reversed.\nThe ordeal hadn’t turned Bordelon off mainstream medicine the way it had for some. Bordelon still trusted the data showing that vaccines were protective. She showed up for her prenatal appointments. But she was warier, less willing to take what physicians said and did at face value. To her, there’d been a lack of communication before her tubal ligation. If she’d known about PTLS, she probably still would have gotten the procedure; it was the disempowerment that rankled. “Since it wasn’t explained, I feel like that choice was taken away from me,” she said.\nShe didn’t want anything like that happening with her twins. She got a bad feeling from her old obstetrician, who provided medicine as if it were rote, the appointments conveyor-belt like, in and out in 10 minutes, with little time for discussion. “They just didn’t really seem concerned that it was twins, and that made me feel a little iffy, because it should have been high-risk pregnancy,” she said. She changed OBs.\nThe shift in her was subtle: not mistrust on a grand scale, but a greater vigilance. “I’ll ask more questions — Is it necessary? What’s better for the babies? — rather than just going with my doctor’s first response.”\nOnce she began to show, word got around. She was pregnant again after a tubal. Other moms started calling, wanting to know the details, wondering if this was something they could pursue themselves. Often, that wasn’t just because they wanted another child. By her count, she heard from five people who’d been having similar symptoms.\nShe remembers one night in particular, waiting for her daughter to emerge from an elementary school dance, chatting with a group of women and discovering that a few of them also had this condition that doctors couldn’t seem to explain or dispel. From a distance, it seemed like a pleasant evening — cool, by Louisiana standards, chilly enough for a 9-year-old to wear jeans, parents conversing in the foyer with strains of Kidz Bop and kids’ voices filtering from the gym — but lean in close enough and you’d hear an undercurrent of pain.",
        "We are seeing a broken NHS dying before our eyes. Scotland must fix it. Dr Iain Kennedy chairs the British Medical Association Scotland. In an exclusive interview he tells our Writer at Large about the shocking crisis engulfing the NHS\nDR Iain Kennedy likes the metaphor of the “anatomy table” as a way of diagnosing the state of the NHS in Scotland today.\nIt’s rather fitting, given that Kennedy – chair of the British Medical Association (BMA) in Scotland – believes the health service is “dying before our eyes”.\nKennedy met with The Herald on Sunday to dissect the NHS. He put the health service on the anatomy table, opened it up, and his prognosis is that “the system is broken”.\nPatients “are dying” unnecessarily because of delays. Doctors feel no “pride” any more in the service they provide, there’s a “toxic culture” of cover-up, and a collapse in pubic confidence is “causing people to question the future of the country”.\nScotland lacks “at least 1,000 GPs” and 1,000 hospital consultants. Patients can wait “two, three or even four weeks” to see their GP. Waiting times for “life-threatening” cancers can be “six weeks”.\nIt’s a far cry from the foundation of the NHS, Kennedy explains, inspired by early experiments in social medicine in Scotland’s highlands. In 1913, the Highland and Islands Medical Service became “the first state-funded health service”.\nIn 1948, the Labour government replicated the Scottish experiment UK-wide. “When the NHS started, there was a strong sense of pride, unity and vocation. It met the needs and demands of the population. That’s the key thing that’s changed: we no longer meet the needs and demands of the population.\n“It was largely doctor led. People had a lot of trust and confidence. It gave a strong sense of security to the public. It was one of the UK’s finest moments and probably the institution we should be most proud of.”\nWhile political decision-making and funding is to blame for the state of the NHS today, demographic change and – ironically – medical advancements have also affected the health service.\n“Demand is so great as the population has grown,” says Kennedy. “The population is older, and more complex.”\nKennedy started studying medicine in 1987.\nWhen he was a junior doctor, “people would come to hospital with strokes, heart attacks and pneumonia and they’d die young – in their late thirties, forties or fifties. I don’t see those illnesses in young people like I once did.\n“Now we have patients who are older, frailer and survive these illness, and live with five, six or seven long-term conditions.”\nThese “highly complex” cases often involve people who “don’t have the same social fabric around them” for support as elderly people once did. “They’re more reliant on the health service and social care.”\nHowever, he adds: “What’s clear is that we simply aren’t meeting the needs of the people of Scotland any more. We’re certainly not meeting demand.\n“I don’t think there are many doctors – and there are 17,000 of my members in Scotland – who will say they’re proud of the NHS overall. That sense of pride has gone. Doctors don’t feel in control any more. The NHS is managerially led, rather than doctor led.\n“It’s become politicised. It’s a political football now. Our patients are frustrated, angry and struggling to get GP appointments. They’re waiting longer and longer for outpatient appointments.”\nDysfunction\nWHEN patients are able to access care, however, they “invariably tell us they get excellent care. So if they access GP appointments, hospital outpatient appointments, hospital inpatient beds, the stories are extremely positive – but it’s accessing healthcare that’s difficult”.\nA key dysfunction is that “far too many people stay in hospital for far too long when they no longer require hospital beds”. Kennedy explains the “lack of social care” means the “back door to the hospital is closed”. Elderly patients, in particular, who could go home, can’t go home as there’s nobody to provide social care on release.\n“The system is clogged up,” Kennedy adds. “GPs are backed up. Patients are coming back and back to see GPs who are chasing up [hospital] appointments that don’t seem to be happening.”\nPatients “frustrated” with being unable to see their GP eventually go to A&E, which in turn leads to hospital overcrowding. The lack of beds – due to elderly patients who can’t be released as there is no social care – means doctors “can’t transfer patients out of A&E” into other wards.\nDoctors now report “that they’ve relearned how to do ward rounds in emergency departments because patients are staying two or three days. That’s why we see headlines about long A&E waiting times and ‘corridor care’ because the hospitals are clogged up with people who’d rather be back home or in care homes”.\nKennedy adds: “To be frank, the system is broken. The NHS in Scotland is dying before our eyes. We’ve lost the founding principle of the NHS – that it’s free at the point of delivery - as many people are having to go private and they’re not happy about that.”\nREAD MORE\nNeil Mackay: English nationalism will be the death of the union\nTHE BIG READ: Professor Sir Geoff Palmer: ‘My family were owned as slaves by Scots. It’s time this nation faced up to its history’\nNeil Mackay: Humiliate them. Ruin them. Stamp on feral Old Firm ultras, hard\nNeil Mackay: How Scotland’s disabled folk changed my view on assisted dying\nOne-third of Scots, or someone in their household, has gone private in the previous two years, Kennedy says, and 40% are considering doing so in the year ahead. “It’s become commonplace. My patients tell me ‘I went private for my knee operation, my hip operation, my scan, because I just couldn’t wait any longer on the NHS’. People are angry.”\nOne of Kennedy’s patients recently told him how “angry and frustrated” he was at “paying taxes all his life and then having to fork out” for two operations.\n“People are going private as they’re distressed with pain,” Kennedy adds. “They’ve lost confidence that the NHS will attend to them, so they’re reluctantly dipping into their pockets or using their insurance to go private.”\nToxic\nA “TOXIC culture” exists within the NHS in Scotland and throughout the UK. “When doctors speak up about matters of patient safety or issues of wrongdoing that they’re witnessing, invariably they experience retribution and retaliation.”\nA majority of doctors has “experienced concerns about patient safety or wrongdoing, but only 17% were satisfied with the outcome”.\nKennedy adds: “We have something seriously wrong with NHS culture. Doctors tell me they experience bullying from managers, and their mental health is questioned.”\nDoctors who complain “fear referral” to the General Medical Council which could lead to being struck off and “job loss. There’s a culture of fear. Young doctors and non-white doctors are particularly frightened about speaking up because of retribution and retaliation”. An example of the complaints doctors might make about patient safety would be, says Kennedy, “patients dying in A&E departments before they’re seen. That’s a fairly basic one. Another example is doctors who raise concerns about waiting times for their patients, or referrals to hospitals being rejected”.\nDoctors are “experiencing more and more that when they refer patients to outpatients the referrals are rejected”. In Kennedy’s own patch, in the Highlands, “46% of the referrals from GPs to the mental health service are sent back”. Doctors who raise concerns “get sidelined, marginalised and not listened to. The system doesn’t want to hear about the problems”.\nScottish health boards, he believes, “focus on reputational management. That’s the fundamental problem. Their prime aim is to manage the reputation of the organisation rather than focus on patient safety. They pay lip service to patient safety. The health board’s reputation comes first”.\nKennedy puts this down to the “politicisation” of the NHS. “There’s a culture of ‘boss-watching’. Each individual in the structure looks up. There’s a line from the clinicians to middle management, to the executive team, to the chief executive, to the director-general of the NHS in Scotland, to the civil servants, to the Cabinet Secretary for Health, up to the First Minister.\n“There’s an axis of power that goes all the way up to the most senior people in the country. That’s why we have this culture problem.”\nKennedy does, though, stress that the current Health Secretary Neil Gray “has assured me that patient safety is something health boards must prioritise”.\nDoes he believe that a deteriorating NHS, coupled with a culture of reputational management, risks issues of public interest being coveredup? “That hits the nail on the head,” Kennedy says. “Health boards generally want to hide problems. Problems tend to be brushed under the carpet.”\nCover-up\nHE has “personal experience” of health boards wanting to avoid “negative media stories about anything going wrong in the health board, or any bad reports going back to government. Those were their priorities”.\nHe adds that “in terms of “cover-up”, if you use the word cover-up”, he had experience of one health board refusing to “share waiting times” with doctors. “We knew as clinicians that waiting times were getting worse and worse, and they wouldn’t share them, on the basis that other health boards weren’t sharing that information. That’s how bad it was. They were hiding the truth.”\nWhat’s actually going on when it comes to accessing GP appointments? Kennedy says patients in rural practices will “generally” still get “same-day appointments” as there’s “less demand”. But in urban practices “demand is our main problem”.\nKennedy, who still works as a GP, runs practices in both rural and urban areas. In his urban practice, receptionists and nursing staff “triage” calls to decide when patients can be seen. “We can’t simply see everyone who wants an appointment. We’d grind to a halt within an hour.”\nThat means “there are people waiting far too long to see GPs. Some of my patients are maybe waiting two, three, even four weeks to see the doctor of their choice. Ultimately, it comes down to funding”.\nThe BMA “is asking for funding restoration for GP practices in Scotland. We’re £290 million short of funding for general practice in Scotland”. Over recent decades, “the number of GPs has flatlined. So the real reason people struggle to see their GP is lack of funding in general practice. That needs sorted urgently”.\nIronically, there are “quite a number of under-employed and even unemployed GPs in Scotland who could come into the workforce. Most of us would take on more GPs if we had the resources”.\nIf more money was spent on GPs, it would mean fewer patients requiring more expensive hospital care. “We’re at a critical juncture in the NHS,” says Kennedy. “We need to shift the balance of care – that’s the phrase we use for focusing resources in the community rather than in hospitals.”\nHe stresses that doesn’t mean taking funds from hospitals, which need their resources “protected”. It means additional funding for GPs. The Scottish Government, he notes, has “spoken about shifting the balance of care for almost 20 years, but they’ve done the exact opposite. Most resources have gone into hospitals, and general practice has been starved. We’re reaping the consequences”.\nThere is no “proper workforce plan in Scotland for doctors and other healthcare workers. We’ve been calling out for that for at least three years”. A workforce plan would “assess the health needs of the population, and work out the numbers of doctors you need and in which specialties. There are almost 15% consultant vacancies in Scotland. We’re probably 1,000 consultants short.\n“We’re many GPs short. We’ve practices falling over throughout Scotland, particularly in deprived and rural areas. We’re at least 1,000 GPs short.”\nWhile the number of medical students has increased, “we didn’t increase the capacity of our medical schools and teaching hospitals to cope with rising numbers of students. So students are reporting really poor educational experiences. They can’t even get into the lecture theatres. When they’re getting taught on wards there’s too many for the teaching doctors to cope with”.\nBottleneck\nIN addition, resident doctors – formerly junior doctors – “are experiencing a real bottleneck. They come to the time in their career where they’re choosing their speciality and there’s not enough training positions for them”.\nKennedy adds: “So we actually have in the UK and Scotland a situation right now where we have doctor unemployment, as we have all those vacancies.” Around 70% of resident doctors are concerned about unemployment.\nHe says Scotland needs to change how we “measure the NHS”. He wants a system which focuses on “the quality of patient care, the outcome of care, and their access to care”.\nHe adds: “As a country, we’ve taken our eye off the ball. There’s been a lack of accountability. There’s been too much siloed thinking, rather than fundamentally looking at the health needs of the population. It’s such a basic thing to do – to look at the health needs that are actually there, and then plan your service accordingly. We just haven’t done that. We’ve sleepwalked into this situation.”\nKennedy says the waiting time crisis in A&E departments “is simply the sign of a bigger problem. It’s the flashing light for the fact the whole NHS system is broken”. More than 800 deaths in Scotland were linked to long A&E waits last year.\nHe adds the deaths were “associated with long A&E waits before admission” and were “extremely concerning, but sadly not surprising. It’s a tragic but entirely predictable outcome of a system in crisis”.\nThe problems at the “front door and back door of hospitals” – accessing GP appointments, and delayed discharge from wards due to lack of social care – “are manifesting themselves in the fact that we have long waits in A&E. So piling more resources into A&E is never going to be the solution”.\nHe adds: “The problems my members report in A&E departments is that patients are dying before they’re seen, and they’re lying in trolleys and corridors. That’s not a nice place to spend a day or two struggling to get your basic personal care looked after.\n“There’s a lot of moral injury and distress, where doctors feel very frustrated and guilty about the service they’re providing for patients. We’ve invested more and more in A&E but we can’t continue doing that because it’s just a sticking plaster.”\nAre patients dying unnecessarily? “Yes. What my members tell me is that patients would have survived had they been seen sooner. We know that there’s evidence of what we call ‘excess mortality’. The figures show that more patients are dying than should have died because they’ve waited too long. That’s the harsh reality of the current situation. It’s obviously a huge worry and why we need urgency around reform and renewal of the NHS in Scotland.”\nPatients can wait “two or three days” in A&E. That doesn’t mean, Kennedy explains, that they’re waiting to be seen for two or three days, but rather they’re forced to remain in A&E “because they can’t get hospital beds”.\nRenewal\nTHE BMA called for a “national conversation on the NHS in Scotland”. However, “the government chose not to do that. They’ve moved forward with plans for ‘renewal’. We really need those plans put into action urgently”.\nKennedy says patients able to access the NHS get “excellent care”, adding: “But where I can’t speak with any confidence positively is about access to healthcare. I can’t speak with any confidence that the right solutions to the future of the NHS will be implemented. There’s been a lot of talk, a lot of reports, over 20 years, but the necessary actions haven’t happened. The majority of my members are angry and frustrated. Some doctors have given up trying to influence anything. That’s a sad state of affairs. They feel people aren’t listening. Ultimately, the solutions must come from those in power, the politicians. The health boards only do what they’re instructed to do by their political masters.”\nREAD MORE\nNeil Mackay: Gangsters are terrorising Scotland, but do our politicians care?\nNeil Mackay: For some she’ll always be guilty simply of being Nicola Sturgeon\nNeil Mackay: Here’s the secret to how the SNP turned Scotland into a one-party state\nNeil Mackay: Scots have a real problem with the truth about empire\nHowever, Kennedy notes: “I believe our First Minister, because he told me personally, and our Cabinet Secretary for Health, do realise how serious the situation is, and I believe they’re serious about change. What I’m not seeing is the urgency to make those changes.”\nIs the crisis in the NHS fuelling the far right and leading to anger in society? “The Scottish people have witnessed deterioration across the board in terms of public services. So the deterioration in the performance of the NHS will no doubt be leading to some anxiety and people’s loss of confidence in their future.\n“People are seeing that they’re not getting the access they used to get. So it’s definitely causing people to question the future of the country.”\nWhen it comes to waiting times for operations and seeing specialists, Kennedy says his patients are going private due to complaints over issue like “orthopaedics – that’s knees and hips; dermatology, that’s skin problems and skin cancers; and gynaecology. There are huge waiting lists for women with serious issues”.\nPatients are waiting “far too long” for outpatient appointments. “It’s not uncommon for me to get letters from hospital departments saying ‘I’ll review this patient is six months’ and a year later the patient comes to see me and says ‘have you heard anything from the hospital?’.\n“GPs are constantly chasing up the system. Waiting times for operations are getting longer and longer.”\nWaits are also caused by the fact that operation times are now longer, as they are safer, Kennedy explains. Appendectomies once took “maybe half an hour”. Now, it’s “done laparoscopically” – using keyhole camera surgery – “but that takes much longer. So where a surgeon might have done 10 to 12 operations daily, they’re now doing four to six”.\nKennedy highlights waiting times for some cancers, especially blood cancers. “It’s really worrying what we’re hearing about waiting times for people with blood cancers – even with the most serious blood cancers, life-threatening blood cancers. Patients are waiting six weeks to be seen by consultant haematologists.”\nCancer\nPATIENTS “with conditions that could potentially become cancerous, that would normally be followed up by haematologists in hospital, are just no longer being followed up”. Instead, GPs are told “can you check this patient once a year and let us know if there are any problems”.\nMore broadly, Kennedy says, “we have a shortage of oncologists – cancer doctors – throughout the country”. He notes that breast cancer patients in the Highlands could be “referred to Forth Valley”.\n“Patients are waiting far too long, way beyond what’s safe for them, and way beyond what they need in terms of getting treatment in the time they need to start treatment.”\nHe adds: “It’s obvious to any frontline clinician that we’ve a problem with mental health services. The specialties that have been neglected over the past decades have been general practice and psychiatry. We have a huge shortage of psychiatrists and mental health nurses. It’s a Cinderella service which doesn’t get the attention it deserves from the media, politicians or public.”\nIn Inverness, for example, 46% of mental health referrals are rejected. “I’ve little doubt the system is so under-resourced and under pressure that the only way doctors can cope is by holding back almost half the people who need to see them, and only focusing on the most serious cases.”\nThose patients “then end up in A&E departments and interacting with police. Police tell me one of their biggest problems is managing to discharge safely members of the public into mental health services. They find it difficult to find places of safety. We have serious problems with our mental health services.\nKennedy adds: “Much of that’s to do with substance misuse, drugs and alcohol. But much is also to do with serious anxiety disorders, depressive illness and psychotic illness.”\nPsychotic patients used to be “admitted to hospital on the day”. Now, there’s a “struggle even to get young teenagers seen by psychiatric services”.\nKennedy believes there’s “absolutely no doubt austerity has damaged the health of the nation. Most frontline clinicians see links between austerity and ill health. Health inequalities have undoubtedly got worse”.\nHe has personally “had patients who have completed suicide because of reductions in their benefits”. The effects of austerity leave him feeling “helpless. One of the saddest things we deal with is the interface between poverty and illness”.\nDue to the crisis in the NHS, staff suffer from verbal abuse and physical violence. “Because of the frustrations of the public and the limited resources, tensions are rising.”\nKennedy has faced violence. “I’ve had to avoid flying chairs in my room on occasion, which is quite frightening.” His office has a panic button. “My room still has the dents in the wall to remind that we’re in a vulnerable position. Violence and aggression occurs far too often.”\nVaccines\nTHE BMA is concerned by “immunisation rates falling in Scotland”. He says: “We’re seeing falling rates of childhood immunisations. Uptake of flu vaccinations is going down. Vaccinations are safe, save lives and prevent disease. There’s a risk of resurgence in infectious disease. We must get immunisation rates up.”\nReferring to Donald Trump scaremongering over vaccines and autism, Kennedy urges the public to “ignore any messages from across the Atlantic”.\n“Renewal” of the Scottish NHS cannot wait until after the next election, Kennedy says. “We need to decouple improvements in the NHS from political cycles.” Political consensus on rescuing the NHS “needs to happen now regardless of next year’s Holyrood election”.\nDespite “polarisation”, politicians must “get into the same room and make the right decisions for the population of Scotland. It’s too grave an issue to be playing politics”. He adds: “All political parties would do well to listen to the medical profession and take advice from the clinicians who actually deal with patients. We know what’s going on as we live and breathe it every day. They need to find a way to work together constructively and get over themselves for the greater good of the population.”\nThe NHS should be “clinician led. We currently have managers leading. That’s why we focus on targets and finances rather than patient experience and the access to healthcare that’s so desperately needed”.\nKennedy doesn’t believe the NHS will be privatised in his “lifetime”. With the right investment and reform, Scotland can recreate “the best health service for everyone. I’m confident we can still do that”.\nHowever, he has no “ideological” problem with using private healthcare to ensure patients get treated in time as long as the fees paid by the state for operations are “the same” as NHS costs.\nThere has, though, “been growth in private healthcare as people are frustrated with NHS waits”.\nAny form of fee-paying by patients for healthcare, however “widens inequalities”. America has the world’s “worst system”. Kennedy says he couldn’t work in America. “I couldn’t see patients suffering and dying simply because they couldn’t afford to pay.”\nIn terms of England and Scotland, we have much better “engagement” between doctors and politicians, “but our waiting times are worse than England”.\nScotland is a “sicker country, and that’s probably getting worse. We have problems with poverty, health inequalities and substance misuse”. The rural nature of much of Scotland is also a contributor.\nIt’s more difficult to deliver healthcare in rural areas. Prescriptions should remain free in Scotland, the BMA believes. Means-testing “would cost as much to police as any savings made”.\nImmigration\nON immigration, Kennedy says that “if it wasn’t for international medical graduates and doctors coming from overseas, the NHS would have already collapsed”, adding: “We’ve a very positive view on immigrant doctors.”\nHowever, “immigration in general does put more pressure on the NHS”, due to issues like translation. “Consultations can take far longer.”\nDue to the “bottleneck” facing resident doctors and the connected problems of “doctor unemployment”, the BMA feels “that UK graduates should be prioritised for jobs”.\nScotland and the rest of the UK once had “the best health service in the world. We can’t claim that now”.\nKennedy learned to be fearless when it comes to speaking out in defence of the NHS. A decade ago he raised waiting time issues and was subjected to “bullying”. He eventually went public as a whistleblower.\nThe bullying was so bad he was treated for PTSD. “It was an extremely traumatic experience,” Kennedy adds. Bullying had created a culture where “nobody was asking questions. It should never be like that”.\nHowever, if doctors don’t have the courage to “speak up”, he says, then “ultimately it’s damaging to patients”.",
        "When a cosmetic surgery chain came to town, so did some problem-prone doctors, court records allege. Not long after California surgeon Andrew S. Hsu landed a job with a cosmetic surgery chain in Georgia, several of his patients alleged they suffered disfiguring injuries, and even his new employer allegedly had doubts about his competence, court records show.\nHsu, a board-certified general surgeon, was one of six out-of-state doctors who joined the Atlanta Goals Aesthetics & Plastic Surgery center during the pandemic. The surgeons received temporary licenses to practice in Georgia, which state officials granted in response to the sudden need for more medical personnel to address the Covid outbreak — even though the center specialized in elective cosmetic surgeries, such as Brazilian butt lifts, or BBLs, and liposuction, paid for in cash or on credit.\nThe Atlanta center announced its opening in March 2021 as an expansion of New York-based Goals Aesthetics & Plastic Surgery, which markets “precision body contouring” for about a dozen surgery clinics in eight states, promising patients a “dream body in just one visit.”\nBut the Atlanta center’s early days were marred by allegations of substandard patient care. Court records show that at least 20 women filed medical malpractice lawsuits, several of which were later dismissed, against the facility, or its owner and surgeons. Hsu was named as a defendant in seven suits filed against the Atlanta center, more than any other physician there. An eighth patient sued Hsu alleging negligence in an operation he performed at a Goals office in New York.\nHsu did not respond to requests for comment. Goals declined to comment. Both have denied any negligence in response to the lawsuits.\nCosmetic surgery chains across the country are attracting patients by promising “minimally invasive” operations to reshape their bodies or get rid of stubborn fat — even helping arrange outside financing for people who can’t pay upfront. Hundreds of thousands of patients are undergoing such procedures each year, and plastic surgeons can earn more than $500,000 each year in one of the highest-paid specialties in American medicine.\nAn investigation by KFF Health News found that lawsuits filed by injured patients have trailed the industry’s growth, in some cases alleging that surgeons lacked adequate training, had histories of malpractice lawsuits or had faced disciplinary action by state medical licensing boards — yet crossed into another state and kept practicing.\nIn the Atlanta lawsuits, Goals has denied any negligence and won dismissal of several of them because patients had signed papers agreeing to outside arbitration — which requires them to resolve disputes privately and outside the court system.\nYet, Goals argued in a separate contract dispute with a medical staffing firm that several of its Atlanta surgeons, including Hsu, were indeed prone to problems — either because they lacked adequate training or had troubled pasts, including investigations by state medical licensing boards into misconduct, court records show. One of Hsu’s Atlanta patients alleged in a separate lawsuit that she suffered in pain for more than a year because a piece of a scalpel was left inside her body after a BBL and liposuction.\nIn a June 2023 court filing in that contract dispute, Goals blamed the problems on a medical staffing firm — Barton Associates, a private equity-owned firm in Massachusetts — it said failed to do adequate background checks on the doctors it supplied. Barton denied the allegations and said it met all terms of the contract.\nNo public database exists to help patients learn the full practice histories of physicians, including cosmetic surgeons. And patients are largely left on their own to decipher which certificates hanging on a surgeon’s office wall, or ballyhooed in web advertising, signify appropriate training and which do not. Disputes among medical specialty groups over whose members are the best qualified to perform cosmetic operations — and deliver the best results — add to the confusion.\nNo government agency tracks injuries or other complication rates at clinics offering cosmetic surgery or any other type of operations. And in many jurisdictions, including Georgia, gaining access to court records — a possible red flag for spotting problems — is laborious and costly.\nCharleetra Hornes, 52, who lives in the Atlanta suburbs and is suing the Goals center for medical malpractice, said she knew nothing of its alleged early troubles and chose the company because its advertising promised “minimal downtime” for recovery and that she would remain awake during the operation.\nShe said she paid $6,650 for a “double BBL” in which fat is suctioned from the stomach, purified and injected into the buttocks and hips to create what Goals calls a “natural-looking enhancement.”\nGoals went ahead with her surgery July 2, 2022, even though she had tested positive for Covid that day, according to the suit. Hornes alleged that two days before the surgery, Goals assigned her to surgeon Thomas Shannon, who has worked for Goals in Georgia and Texas.\nThough staff gave her pills to manage the discomfort, Hornes said, she suffered “excruciating pain” during the procedure, according to the suit.\nThat night, she spiked a fever that sent her to the emergency room. She spent two weeks in the hospital recovering from injuries, including a “severe burn on her side,” according to the suit.\n“I’ve been disfigured and burned up, and it’s not fair,” she said in an interview.\nIn June 2024, Hornes sued Shannon, the Goals center and Barton Associates, alleging malpractice. On Sept. 2, a Georgia judge dismissed Shannon from the case, ruling that Hornes failed to serve him with the complaint in Texas before the statute of limitations ran out. He did not respond to requests for comment.\nIn a separate order issued on the same day, the judge also dismissed the other defendants, citing the statute of limitations issue and that Hornes had previously signed an arbitration agreement. Some cosmetic surgery chains and other medical practices ask patients to sign such agreements.\nHornes wishes she had learned more about the Atlanta surgery center, instead of accepting what she calls its “flashy” come-ons. “I wish I would have taken it more seriously,” she said in an interview, “because it was life-altering.”\nMalpractice cases and settlements are useful tools\nKFF Health News identified more than 200 lawsuits filed against multistate cosmetic surgery companies, mostly over the past seven years, including cases involving a dozen deaths, using databases of court records.\nLawsuits by themselves don’t prove wrongdoing. Many cases are settled under confidential terms that keep critical details under wraps. Yet, medical authorities and most physician licensing boards regard malpractice cases and settlements as a useful tool for detecting possible patterns of substandard health care that may harm patients.\nCourt files show that surgeons who were sued numerous times for malpractice — and in some cases disciplined by state medical boards for misconduct — have managed to get hired by cosmetic surgery chains.\nGoals, owned by physician Sergey Voskin, has contracted with eight surgeons with three or more malpractice cases filed against them, including in the Atlanta area, court records allege. Gerald Hickson, founding director of the Vanderbilt Center for Patient and Professional Advocacy and an expert on medical malpractice issues, called that number of suits a “warning” of possible problems, despite their outcome.\nEarlier this year, a Pennsylvania woman identified in court filings as “P.C.” sued Goals, Voskin and surgeon Peter Driscoll, alleging Driscoll came on board despite an “extensive history of malpractice allegations, licensing suspensions and discipline” in Texas and California, according to medical board records cited in the suit. Companies hiring doctors have ready access to the nonpublic National Practitioner Data Bank, which details disciplinary problems in a doctor’s past. But it’s not clear from court records whether anybody made these standard background checks. Goals did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe suit also accuses Goals of consumer fraud for touting its surgeons as “double if not triple board certified plastic surgeons.” According to the complaint, Driscoll was board-certified by the American Board of Otolaryngology, a specialty that focuses on treatment and surgery of head and neck areas. Driscoll is no longer certified in the specialty, according to the American Board of Medical Specialties website.\nThe woman alleges that Driscoll sexually harassed her and made “unwanted and unwelcome sexual contact” during a BBL procedure in June 2022 at a Goals office in New Jersey.\nAccording to the suit, staff members overheard Driscoll watching pornography in an office bathroom multiple times, but Goals did not terminate him at the time. New Jersey’s State Board of Medical Examiners temporarily suspended Driscoll’s license in February 2023 related to the incident, and the woman’s lawsuit is pending in federal court in New Jersey. Goals and Voskin have denied the allegations in the suit and filed a motion to dismiss or compel arbitration of the case. Driscoll, who has not filed a response with the court, could not be reached for comment.\nPerformance issues not ‘disqualifying’\nOther cosmetic surgery chains have faced multiple malpractice actions targeting surgeons or other health care providers who staff their clinics, court records show.\nThe surgeon roster at Mia Aesthetics, a Miami-based chain that operates 13 cosmetic surgery offices nationwide, lists four doctors with three or more malpractice actions since 2020, court records show.\nNearly a dozen injured patients have filed lawsuits criticizing the credentials of doctors and nurse practitioners affiliated with Belle Medical, including the family of a 70-year-old Utah woman with five children who died in the car two days after liposuction as her husband rushed her from home to a hospital, according to court records.\nHer husband alleges he called Belle Medical’s office the day after the procedure to say his wife was having difficulty breathing and heart palpitations and couldn’t walk more than a short distance, which the lawsuit argued were “textbook symptoms of pulmonary embolism, or blood clot in the lung.” According to the suit, nobody at Belle Medical advised the family to seek immediate medical care. An autopsy found she died from “bilateral pulmonary emboli,” according to the suit.\nBacked by Peterson Partners, a Utah private equity and investment firm, Belle Medical operates in Utah, Idaho and Oklahoma, offering liposuction and other cosmetic surgery. Neither Belle Medical nor Peterson Partners responded to requests for comment. In court filings, Belle Medical has argued that its medical providers are independent contractors who are solely responsible for any procedures they perform.\nPrivate equity-backed Sono Bello, the largest of the cosmetic surgery chains with more than 100 locations nationwide, has defended more than a dozen lawsuits alleging the company contracted with inadequately trained doctors or practitioners previously disciplined by medical licensing boards. In May 2023, Ohio’s medical board revoked the license of a Sono Bello contract surgeon after three of her patients died, two of them following procedures at a Sono Bello office in the Cleveland area, according to medical board records.\nRobert Centeno, Sono Bello’s medical director for the East region, told KFF Health News that many surgeons have past performance issues, which he called “not, in fact, disqualifying.”\n“The vast majority of our colleagues are extremely professional and committed to their profession,” he said in an interview. “And while there may be a momentary lapse or issue with their practice, most of our surgeons take those sanctions, take that counseling, that advice, and improve their practices and go on to be very, very productive members of the medical community.”\nAsked about malpractice lawsuits filed against the company, Centeno said that Sono Bello has “performed over 300,000 procedures to date,” which he described as “more procedures for more patients completed safely than anyone else in the industry. It would be natural and understandable to know that at some point during that process, that a patient has actually sued us,” Centeno said.\n‘Unable to perform’\nIn early 2020, as the pandemic slowed business in New York City, Goals sought to expand to Atlanta — a hot market for its BBLs. In a PR Newswire release, Goals promised patients “amazing contours” and boasted of having “some of the most experienced, and aesthetically forward surgeons in the industry.” BBLs and liposuction make up 95% of its business, marketed to mostly Black and Hispanic women, Goals owner Voskin testified in a deposition filed this year in the Driscoll case. Many Atlanta patients suing the company paid roughly $6,000 to $8,000 for their surgeries, court records show.\nGoals initially staffed the Atlanta center through Barton Associates. Many hospitals and medical offices rely on such firms to find temporary doctors and other staff. Under the deal, Barton charged Goals $1,400 for each procedure and paid about $600 of that to the surgeon, according to Goals’ court filings.\nIn 2023, Barton sued Goals in a Massachusetts court alleging it was owed $487,000 in fees. Goals admitted that it “temporarily ceased payment” to Barton. But it fired back with a counterclaim accusing Barton of failing to check the qualifications and backgrounds of surgeons as required by the agreement.\nGoals named five surgeons Barton sent to the center, including Hsu, and pointed to the spate of malpractice cases in Atlanta to bolster its argument.\nGoals said it “became immediately apparent” that another surgeon was “fundamentally unable to perform his duties.” The surgeon was “abrasive, vulgar and could not conduct himself in accordance with reasonable professional standards that were expected in a medical workplace,” according to Goals’ counterclaim.\nA second surgeon Barton presented as “highly skilled” turned out to have “an extensive history of complaints about his professional conduct” in two other states, according to the counterclaim.\nBarton and Goals settled the case and counterclaim in April 2024 under confidential terms. Barton did not respond to requests for comment. Barton denied Goals’ allegations in earlier court filings and said that it “complied fully” with the terms of its contract with the surgery company.\nIn its counterclaim, Goals argued that shortly after Hsu joined the staff in 2021, it learned he had “multiple issues” in California and “was about to lose his medical license as a result,” according to a court filing.\nGoals provided “significant legal and other assistance” to keep that from happening and Hsu “required substantial training in order to do acceptable work on patients,” the company argued in court filings.\nSeven women filed malpractice suits in 2023 alleging they sustained injuries from BBLs and liposuction Hsu performed at the Atlanta office between mid-February 2021 and the end of June 2021, court records show. Barton, the staffing firm, also is a defendant in these cases and has denied wrongdoing. Hsu has denied wrongdoing in the cases and sought to enforce arbitration agreements.\nHsu’s emergency Georgia medical license, approved in January 2021, expired in April 2022, state records show. Hsu is licensed in New York and California, where he has also worked for Goals.\nTwo suits accuse Hsu of leaving a piece of metal inside the bodies of women, a calamity patient safety experts believe should never occur.\nIn one Atlanta case, a patient who alleged she had experienced constant pain since her surgery at Goals in 2021 said she discovered why more than a year later when a chest X-ray ordered after a car crash showed a piece of scalpel blade in her upper abdomen, according to her court filings. The action against Hsu and Barton Associates was settled early this year, court records show.\nIn the second case, a New Jersey woman who had a BBL at Goals’ Harlem office in New York City in February 2022 alleged she overheard Hsu say in the operating room that he had “left something inside of her,” which turned out to be a metal liposuction cannula tip that had broken off in her stomach. A judge dismissed her lawsuit due to an arbitration clause. She filed a notice of appeal, but the case was settled in August.\nThe California medical board’s investigation of Hsu ended in October 2023 with a settlement and disciplinary order. The state accused him of “repeated negligent acts” in treating six patients dating to 2016, including three people who died. None involved cosmetic surgery like his work at Goals.\nThe board revoked his license but stayed the action and imposed a four-year probation, tacking on a $24,000 penalty to cover costs of the investigation. The order also required Hsu to find a practitioner to help oversee his practice and prohibits him from serving on any on-call panel for general surgery. In settling the case, Hsu did not admit any wrongdoing.\nGoals has featured Hsu in a TikTok video, and boasts on its website that he is a “highly skilled surgical specialist,” who provides “top-notch surgical care.”\nFellowship Training\nHow much training cosmetic surgery chains demand of surgeons varies, judging by physician service contracts obtained by KFF Health News through court filings. Some contracts simply require that the doctor hold a valid state medical license, while others specify that doctors “represent” that they are qualified to perform cosmetic surgery and have not been disciplined by licensing boards or been hit with major malpractice awards.\nSono Bello takes a different route. The company sponsors a six- to eight-week training course for surgeons, which it calls a “fellowship,” and posts details online.\nSono Bello accepts applicants from more than half a dozen surgical specialties and focuses its training on liposuction and a type of tummy tuck procedure called AbEX.\nCourt records show that Sono Bello has defended at least a dozen lawsuits from patients who argued some surgeons lacked sufficient training or had other problems, or alleged they were misled by some advertising that described surgeons who completed the fellowship as “board certified plastic surgeons.”\nSono Bello’s credentialing process came under attack in a 2023 malpractice lawsuit filed by Shirley Webb, a 79-year-old Nevada woman who says she spent months in hospitals and rehabilitation care recovering from sepsis after a tummy tuck and liposuction performed by surgeon Charles Kim in Las Vegas in December 2022.\nKim, a colorectal surgeon, took the Sono Bello fellowship from July 2022 to October 2022, court records show. In a deposition, Kim, who is board-certified in general surgery, stated that Sono Bello knew he had been disciplined by Nevada’s state medical licensing board for alleged malpractice in which a patient he operated on died. Kim paid a $4,000 fine and received a letter of reprimand in settling the medical board case without admitting wrongdoing.\nKim also testified in the medical malpractice case that Sono Bello was aware he had previously settled four medical malpractice cases, court records show. Christopher Chung, Sono Bello’s chief medical officer, said the company verified that Kim’s state medical license and other credentials “were up to date and in good standing” before it hired him. “We reviewed his surgical log, which detailed the voluminous and complex surgeries he had performed at the hospital where he was then employed, and received positive references from his employer and other surgeons,” Chung said in an emailed statement.\nA medical expert hired by Webb’s legal team opined that Sono Bello’s use of the term “fellowship” is deceptive because the program is not accredited, or recognized by any subspecialty certifying board, professional society, or hospital. A medical fellowship is typically a training program that lasts at least a year. “We strongly disagree with the suggestion that our website is misleading. We accurately state that our physicians are board-certified surgeons — because they are,” Sono Bello spokesperson Mark Firmani said in response.\nIn her lawsuit, Webb testified that Sono Bello’s advertisements on television and online led her to believe the company employed only board-certified plastic surgeons.\nHad she been told of Kim’s background in advance, “I wouldn’t have had the surgery done,” Webb testified in a 2024 deposition.\nThe parties settled the suit early this year under confidential terms.",
        "Is Oregon Paving the Way for Universal Health Care in the US?. Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.\nIn 2022, Oregonians narrowly passed Measure 111, amending their constitution and guaranteeing affordable health care as a fundamental right to every resident of the state. Through years of organizing, coalition building and planning, Oregon may enact its Universal Health Plan as early as fall 2027.\nIn the face of extreme Medicaid cuts from the Trump administration, which will leave roughly 16 million people without health coverage by 2034, a state-level universal plan could mean the difference between cared-for, insured patients and thousands of preventable deaths.\nOregon’s single-payer health care dream still has hurdles to overcome, but with a constitutional amendment voted in by the people, it may have a leg up over previous state-level campaigns, such as Vermont’s Green Mountain Care in the early 2010s. Even so, a clear understanding of what went wrong in previous campaigns — as well as continued organizing in Oregon — is needed to push it through.\nDon’t miss a beat\nGet the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.\nIf successful, Oregon could lead by example and set the stage for a better, more efficient health care system in other states. While a national campaign isn’t on the table, organizers can look to Oregon for how to push a bold health agenda in their state.\nWhat Happened in Vermont?\nIn 2011, Vermont’s state government set in motion the steps to enact a publicly-funded, universal health care program across the state.\nFor over a decade, organizers in Vermont fought for a single-payer health care system. Through forums, rallies and public education campaigns, groups like Vermont Health Care for All, the Vermont Workers’ Center and Vermont Businesses for Social Responsibility built a broad coalition to push for universal coverage.\nThe program, referred to as Green Mountain Care, came very close to implementation, but it was shot down in 2014. It did not have the buy-in from then-Gov. Peter Shumlin, who cited significant tax increases as his primary issue.\nDr. Deborah Richter, a physician and president of Vermont Health Care for All, spoke at over 500 events in the lead-up to Green Mountain Care in 2011. Richter agreed that taxes were the greatest barrier in Vermont’s state-level campaign, but highlighted a key flaw with this logic.\nUnder a publicly-funded system, the taxes are all out in the open, making it easier to criticize. Under the private insurance system, health care costs are generally hidden — often in the prices of goods — with the financial burden falling on individuals with medical needs.\n“We do a lot of cost shifting,” Richter said. “You don’t realize that when you go into a store, and they’re paying for health insurance, that you’re paying higher prices for that [through] the goods that are in that store. You’re paying higher property taxes to pay for public employees’ health insurance. You’re paying a lot of other hidden taxes to pay for health care for other people.”\nFor Vermont, this meant people saw a scary price tag and may not have understood the tangible benefits. According to Richter, what a publicly-funded system really does is shift the cost-burden onto the wealthy, creating a fairer, more efficient and more complete system. Getting that message across, however, is its own challenge.\nOrganizing Against a Behemoth\nA number of less-comprehensive plans would later be proposed in Vermont, such as universal primary care, but the single-payer system drifted into the background. Oregon will likely face many of the same challenges, but with the distinct advantage of a constitutional amendment on the books.\nAccording to Collin Stackhouse, communications coordinator for Health Care for All Oregon, or HCAO, Oregon’s Universal Health Plan Governance Board aims to propose the next draft of the health care plan in fall 2025. Stackhouse and multiple other HCAO members and affiliates serve on the Universal Health Plan Governance Board and its four committees.\nOver the past three years, HCAO has built a multifaceted organizing apparatus. With an emphasis on community outreach and voter education, they’ve conducted crowd canvassing, tabling at events and given presentations with a wide variety of community organizations, such as faith groups, Rotary clubs and neighborhood associations.\nRobyn Gottlieb, an organizer with HCAO, emphasized a few key elements in their strategy. Throughout the process, HCAO asks people to sign up for their mailing list to further help mobilize volunteers and also informs people about the Governance Board.\n“We have folks writing testimony to the Governance Board advocating for the strongest health plan possible with the most coverage,” Gottlieb said. “We want dental, we want vision, we want all the things.”\nThese efforts aim to create a strong network of advocates that can push a comprehensive health plan over the line without backstepping. With the final draft of the health plan due from the Governance Board by September 2026, engaging as many people as possible will be crucial over the next year.\nEven with this push from HCAO, the general lack of knowledge about universal health care still presents a challenge.\n“I answer the comments [on our organization’s social media] and there’s a lot of misinformed people,” Stackhouse said. “There’s no way to give any detail or nuance in a 90-second clip.”\nDisinformation from opponents of Oregon’s universal health plan is expected, and Stackhouse emphasized the need to connect with people in their communities in order to overcome this — especially given how complicated the current health system is.\n“Part of our hope as an organization is that we can reach everybody, every person in every corner of the state in some capacity,” Stackhouse said. “It’s becoming a pretty central part of our next year, these things called community conversations: actually having local people … go speak publicly in these different communities with their neighbors about the plan.”\nWhat this really boils down to is recognizing the lack of information around health care, then finding a way to pull back the veil on the health care system with people across the state.\n“One of the main key points that I think everybody [needs to know] is that universal health care is cheaper,” Stackhouse said. “Our taxes probably will change, but we have the most expensive health care system in the whole world. Everybody [else] is spending less money, and they have universal health care. All of the countries that have the best health care have universal health care.”\nFor some, the buy-in may come from learning about universal health care itself, but others may need a more personal understanding. Getting individuals to consider the reality of never needing to pay another copay or deductible can make the difference. If there’s time, Gottlieb emphasized the power of telling a personal story as well.\nThere are still some details to iron out in Oregon’s plan, such as residency requirements and how the system would work for Oregonians traveling in other states. However, if Oregon is able to overcome the many challenges, it could clear a path for the United States to join all other high-income countries in providing affordable health care to its people.\nThe Small Origin of Canadian Universal Health Care\nUniversal health care in Canada began with the founding of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, or CCF, in 1932, one of the earliest democratic socialist parties in North America. In the early 1940s, the party’s grassroots engagement and political education efforts dramatically boosted party membership and led to a sweeping victory in Saskatchewan, where they won 47 out of 52 seats in 1944.\nFollowing through on one of its many political aims, in 1947, CCF introduced the Saskatchewan Hospital Services Plan, the first universal hospital insurance program in North America. By 1962, the Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act took effect, bringing publicly-funded health insurance to the entire province.\nWhile the process wasn’t without pushback, including a failed doctors’ strike, Saskatchewan’s Medicare system would pave the way for Canada’s nationwide universal health plan, culminating in the Canada Health Act of 1984.\nThrough effective organizing based on working-class values and affordability, the CCF was able to kickstart dramatic change. The first domino that fell in favor of national universal health care in Canada came from a rural province with only around five percent of the population at the time.\nIn the U.S., Oregon is not the only state working on a single-payer plan. The nonprofit One Payer States lists 22 states across the country with active movements or infrastructure for universal health care plans, but Oregon is closest to the finish line.\nEven with cross-state support, significant resistance is expected in Oregon and nationally.\nPhilip Verhoef, the immediate past president of Physicians for a National Health Plan, emphasized the need for administrative simplicity to build a viable health care system in Oregon, especially when facing down the private insurance industry.\n“I assume the various private insurance companies that do business in Oregon are going to fight this tooth and nail because it’s going to effectively take them out of the game,” Verhoef said. “You almost need to make the argument impervious to money. The people fighting for single-payer are never going to outspend the insurance company, so instead they simply have to get everyone on their side.”\nThe reality facing advocacy groups like HCAO is a U.S. private health insurance industry worth over a trillion dollars. Getting everyone on your side is far from a simple task, but that’s where the on-the-ground organizing comes in.\nHCAO’s community conversations, health care education efforts and volunteer mobilizing could make the difference in passing a universal health care plan that is both comprehensive and affordable.\nOregon could be the domino that universal health care needs to spread across the country. It will require community effort, cultivating a deeper understanding of the vast inefficiencies in American health care and ultimately realizing a dream of something better.\nAs we careen toward significantly more health care-related deaths due to the Trump administration’s cuts, the situation may be bleak. However, Richter suggests universal coverage could be a light at the end of the tunnel.\n“You hope [that people] at least wake up and realize you can’t just keep kicking the can down the road, that this is not going to get better,” Richter said. “I’m optimistic because things are so bad. There is no other way to solve this problem.”\nKeep the press free. Fight political repression.\nTruthout urgently appeals for your support.

        "Rural Americans who rely on Head Start worry about its future: ‘Without free childcare I couldn’t work’. For almost as long as she’s been a mother, Sara Laughlin has known where she could turn for help in Troy, a western Ohio town 20 miles north of Dayton.\nFor years, the local Head Start program provided stability and care for her oldest son, and it now does the same for her two younger children, twin boys. Head Start was there for Laughlin and her family through tough transitions, including the end of a long relationship. She credits the free federally funded program, housed in a blue building on the edge of this manufacturing hub of 27,000, for allowing her to keep her job as a massage therapist while raising three kids.\n“If we had to pay for childcare, I would not be able to work,” Laughlin said. “There’s no way I could do it.”\nSo, Laughlin said, she was “dumbfounded” when she heard this spring that Head Start was targeted for elimination in an early draft of Donald Trump’s budget proposal.\nIn small towns and rural areas throughout the country, voters like her were key to both of Trump’s election victories. Laughlin was particularly attracted to his campaign promise to eliminate taxes on tips, which she relies on. She couldn’t conceive why cuts to early childhood programs would be on the table.\n“Out of all the things in this country that we could get rid of, why do you want to attack our children’s learning?” she said.\nLaughlin’s experience shows what’s at stake in towns and rural areas up and down the western side of Ohio – and across the country. In many of these communities, Head Start, which combines early childhood education, health, nutrition and other family services, is the only game in town for childcare, allowing thousands of parents to work. It’s often the only early childhood program in which educators can make a decent wage in a chronically underpaid industry. And it’s a key source of connection and support for parents dealing with trauma, job loss, poverty and parenting challenges.\nNearly 90% of rural counties in the United States have Head Start programs, which are funded with federal dollars and run by public or private agencies including schools and non-profits. Almost half of the 716,000 children Head Start serves live in rural congressional districts, compared with just 22% in urban districts.\n“These are communities that are underinvested in by philanthropy or the states where they are,” said Katie Hamm, who during the Biden administration served as deputy assistant secretary for early childhood development at the federal Administration for Children and Families, which oversees Head Start.\nIn many rural communities, the program is not just about education and childcare. Head Start is particularly crucial to the survival of these local areas in a way it isn’t in larger urban areas with more diverse economies. The program not only employs local residents; it also supports other local businesses as centers pay rent, buy food from local farmers and grocers, use local mechanics to repair buses, hire local technicians to service kitchens, and pay local carpenters to outfit centers.\nHead Start was created in 1965 to provide early learning, family support and health services to low-income families, part of Lyndon B Johnson’s “war on poverty”. The program has long enjoyed bipartisan support: 74% of Trump voters and 86% of Democrats said earlier this year that they support funding the program, according to a survey conducted on behalf of the advocacy group First Five Years Fund.\nAlthough Head Start has survived elimination so far this year, its local centers are still trying to recover from what many say feels like death by a thousand federal cuts since Trump took office – with more likely to come.\nIn early February, many Head Start programs were caught up in a federal funding freeze. Then the Trump administration fired about 20% of the program’s federal staff.\nThis spring, some rural programs shut down because the administration delayed Head Start payments in some regions. In April, the administration abruptly closed five regional Head Start offices, cutting off a main source for support for programs. Just three months after that, the administration announced that undocumented immigrant children, long eligible for Head Start, could no longer participate.\nIn the midst of all that turmoil, some local and regional Head Start programs have begun laying off employees. At the start of the year, the government withheld nearly $1bn in funding from local programs, a move the Government Accountability Office called illegal in July. While the money has since been distributed, in the interim several Head Start programs closed temporarily, and a few have told some staff they will be let go.\nAfter all that, Head Start leaders in rural communities said, their futures feel more tenuous than ever. While urban Head Start programs are more likely to be supported by large, well-resourced organizations that receive donations from individuals and local philanthropies, those additional funding streams are often absent in rural communities.\nIn Greenville, Ohio, a town of about 12,700 that hugs the Indiana border 40 miles north-west of Dayton, the median household income is just under $47,000. The local Head Start program is one of just two licensed childcare centers available in town for nearly 600 children under the age of five who live in Greenville. Run by the Ohio-based Council on Rural Services non-profit, it serves children whose parents work in nearby retail stores, fast food chains or factories, as well as a growing number of kids being raised by their grandparents.\nTeachers there describe their work as far more than providing childcare. On any given day, in addition to teaching a group of preschoolers, Greenville Head Start teacher Sasha Fair may find herself lending an ear to parents who need to vent and helping caregivers track progress toward personal educational, parenting or employment goals. At her center, like many others in the region, Head Start workers pool their money to buy birthday presents for children who would otherwise go without. They track down car seats for parents who can’t afford them. And they go door to door to local dentists trying to convince them to accept children who use Medicaid.\n“It’s about connection and community,” Fair said. She was terrified for the families she serves when she heard Head Start was briefly on the chopping block.\n“These are our future,” she said, gesturing at the preschoolers playing in her classroom. “We need to give them the strongest, best possible start, and that includes their healthcare, their access to care, their education.”\nMany residents would also be out of jobs if Head Start programs were to close. Nationally, nearly a quarter of the program’s teachers are parents with children currently or formerly in the program. In Ohio, Head Start is among the state’s 50 largest employers, providing work for more than 8,000 Ohioans and, by extension, additional area residents who rely on Head Start spending.\n“We try to stay local and utilize whoever is local,” said Stacey Foster, who leads a Head Start program in Urbana, a town of about 11,000 that is 40 miles north-east of Dayton and surrounded by picturesque fields and farmhouses.\nThe program’s fleet of buses is serviced by Jeff’s Automotive Service, a local garage. Katy Leib, service manager at Jeff’s Automotive, said demand for work rises and falls, especially this year, with some people spending cautiously because of economic uncertainty.\nShe said being able to rely on Head Start as one of its larger, more consistent accounts has been helpful for the business’s stability. If Head Start were to lose its funding, it would affect not just Jeff’s Automotive, but other companies that contract with Jeff’s.\n“When we’re working on their vehicles, we’re also purchasing parts from local businesses. It’s affecting tire companies and our oil companies,” Leib said. ”It’s a domino effect.”\nHeather Littrell, who lives in Troy, is an example of a parent who found support, and eventually employment, through Head Start. At 19 years old, she was standing in line to apply for housing assistance when she spotted an ad for free preschool. At the time, she was struggling to keep a job while raising her two young children. Family members helped when they could, but without consistent childcare, Littrell was forced to leave job after job at local factories and a gas station.\n“Everything was unstable,” she said. “I wasn’t really knowing what direction I was going to take.”\nLittrell ended up enrolling her girls in Head Start, where they learned their colors, numbers and social skills, while Littrell received parenting advice, diapers and meals for her daughters. Most important, she could work. A few years later, inspired by her experience as a Head Start parent, Littrell decided to pursue a degree in early childhood education.\nNow, 17 years later, she has moved from being a Head Start student teacher to serving as a coordinator for mental health and disability services in Head Start programs across western Ohio.\n“If I hadn’t seen that flyer that day, I wouldn’t be standing here now,” she said. “I really did use Head Start to help me become a better person and a better member of society.”\nTrump’s latest budget proposal would not change the amount of money set aside for Head Start, but, given inflation, keeping the program’s budget unchanged effectively amounts to a cut.\nLaurie Todd-Smith, appointed by the Trump administration in June to oversee federal early childhood programs at the Administration for Children and Families, including Head Start, acknowledged that the programs play an important role in rural areas. “If Head Start wasn’t in rural areas where those most impoverished families are, we’d have very different outcomes for children,” she said.\nBut Todd-Smith isn’t convinced that the program needs more money. Rather, she said, programs should look for ways to be more efficient. In some places, state-funded offices already provide health services, employment assistance and mental health assistance. She said Head Start programs could tap into those services instead of offering their own.\n“There might be some cost savings if we actually link state systems to some of the work of Head Start, instead of creating duplication of services,” Todd-Smith said.\nAt the local level, however, Head Start providers say that if they’re going to raise salaries, keep teachers and serve more children – there aren’t currently enough seats for all who qualify – they need more money.\nLittrell, the former Head Start parent who now works for the program, hopes residents will realize programs such as Head Start are critical for communities like hers and vote for politicians who will try to protect them. From her early years as a teen mom, she said, she knows how easy it is to end up in a situation where a family needs some help to move forward.\n“We had food stamps, we had [subsidized] housing, we used Head Start,” Littrell said. “We used them to help us build a life where we didn’t depend on those social services. But they were there for us when we needed them.”\nThis story was produced by the Hechinger Report, a non-profit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.",
        "At the farmers market, slashed benefits threaten MAHA’s food-as-medicine goal. CHAMBERSBURG, Pa. — There is no time like late August for a farmers market, when the earth blesses shoppers with its juiciest delights. The folding tables and tents pop open, and by 9 a.m. a musician is crooning over the zucchini, bubbles from a nearby face-painting stall drifting by. In this small borough near Gettysburg, in the southern part of the state, summer’s finest produce comes within reach for even the poorest residents with help from vouchers, food stamps, and wooden tokens.\nIt’s here that a key part of the Make America Healthy Again message comes alive. A Saturday market packed with goods from nearby farms serves as an antidote to the poor nutrition driving many Americans’ health problems. To MAHA, this little parking lot is the ultimate pharmacy. But practical difficulties quickly become evident. The customers, many of whom live in low-income or senior housing, rely on benefit programs to meet their basic needs. As the federal government changes its position on who deserves a safety net, some of these patrons stand to lose a lot — even some of the foods they consider medicine.\nMany market goers live on the knife’s edge, teetering between a delicate stability and a financial abyss, and are concerned about how changes to Medicaid or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program will affect them. On Labor Day, SNAP cuts included as part of President Trump’s tax bill went into effect, reducing benefits for millions of poor Americans.\nAlready, fewer low-income seniors in Pennsylvania received vouchers for buying fresh produce this summer. And the vouchers themselves have shrunk — to $25 from $50 for the season — due to federal funding cuts. Those lost dollars make a difference in places like Chambersburg.\nThere is no grocery store in this area, which sits between a wealthier part of town and low-income neighborhoods, so the small market in a parking lot is an oasis every weekend until November. One of its main highlights is a produce-packed stall run by Lorenzo Varisano of Foot of the Mountain Farm.\nThe small, organic, regenerative farm he runs with his wife, Jessica, and their five children is exactly the kind of operation health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his Make America Healthy Again crowd tout as the future of American food. Poor diet and nutrition are at the root of the chronic disease crisis, and the solution begins with the food supply, the secretary says.\nIt made sense then, that Kennedy stopped by Varisano’s tent at a recent event on the National Mall celebrating farmers. They talked and took a selfie in front of a horde of reporters and MAHA fans.\nFoot of the Mountain was a good photo op: The Varisanos stay away from harsh chemicals and focus on nurturing healthy soil and maximizing productivity per acre. They only sell their produce and homemade baked goods directly to customers, at three weekly markets. But as far as politics go, Lorenzo is a skeptic. Meeting the secretary, he said, was like meeting any other person.\n“I don’t pledge allegiance to anybody. They serve us,” he said. Their farm might be MAHA, but they don’t personally adopt any label. Even “farmer” feels too forced; Lorenzo is more of a caretaker of the soil, he said.\nA social worker by training, he is more focused on the needs of his customers — and how federal decisions could push them further from a healthy lifestyle. “The farm is just the front. It’s about community,” he said.\nLately, the Varisanos have been noticing more penny-pinching at the markets, especially as vouchers from the Farmers Market Nutrition Programs slowed. An extra infusion of cash the program got during Covid came to a halt, too.\n“You see a lot more, like, calculating,” Jessica told STAT at the D.C. market. “That thought process of, ‘What am I going to do, how am I gonna use this, how much money do I have?’ A lot more of the planning.”\n“They might actually be trying to eat healthy and they’re getting vegetables, but the kids want cherry tomatoes, and they’ll be like, ‘Oh, no, we can’t afford that,’” Lorenzo added.\nOn this sunny morning in Chambersburg, his stall is bursting with rainbows of peppers and carrots, giant leeks, alien-looking celeriac and spring onions. Varisano’s eldest daughter quietly helps arrange cartons of muscular tomatoes. Mounds of yellow corn and bowling ball-sized watermelons fill a nearby bin. Stacks of his sourdough loaves, peach danishes and chocolate chip cookies glint in their plastic wrappers.\n“For you and your siblings,” Varisano says as he hands a customer’s young daughter a quart of cherry tomatoes, on the house. This market was the first one Foot of the Mountain began selling at, nearly a dozen years ago, so it’s where he sees many of his longtime customers. Varisano is now on the market’s board.\nIt’s a good place to shop if you don’t have much to spend, especially if you’re sick. Many people here are. Pennsylvania was one of eight states with a higher number of years lived with disability — a commonly used measure of health — than any country in the world in 2021. Over half of deaths in the state in 2019 were from preventable causes, including heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. They are driven by day-to-day behaviors, like whether a person uses tobacco, or exercises, or how many fruits and vegetables they consume.\nVarisano and his fellow farmers help with that last part. Thanks to donations and grants, the market has been able to match shoppers’ SNAP dollars up to $25, doubling what patrons have to spend on fresh produce and goods. That boost helps a single mother of five get a tote bag full of groceries, including fresh bread, garlic from just 40 miles away, and scarlet-red peppers that her kids snack on like apples.\nAnother single mother, 32-year-old Mary Lehman, stretches her benefits at the market, too. She started receiving SNAP and money from the Women, Infants and Children program about a year and a half ago, while going through a divorce with two small children and another on the way. In the time since, it’s been a challenge to hold onto the money.\nNot long ago, she was receiving about $600 per month in nutrition benefits, which helped her afford organic infant formula for her youngest, among other goods. But when she got a new job that paid 50 cents more per hour, her benefits got cut in half, she said.\nShe now has to spend an extra $150 every other week on food expenses. “That’s a huge cut for only 50 cents more,” she said, her doe-eyed baby balanced on her left hip. WIC gives her an additional $30 in fresh produce vouchers to spend at the market, which helps, because she can trade in some of that for wooden tokens to buy baked goods or meat products.\nHowever, nutrition assistance only relieves one of many financial stressors she faces.\nLehman’s health coverage, for instance, would have eaten at least $200 out of her paycheck — money she can’t afford to lose; childcare alone costs more than that each month — so she went on Medicaid. She worries about forthcoming changes there, too. Payment cuts to physicians could further limit healthcare access in places like this. It’s already hard enough as a Medicaid patient to find an appointment with a specialist in Chambersburg, where many providers work for the same hospital system.\nAnother mother, the primary caregiver for her autistic son, expressed concern that she would no longer get paid for that work, which helps support her whole family. Earlier in the week she broke down crying to one of her children’s nurses because she was so overwhelmed trying to making ends meet, she told STAT. She learned of the farmers market only recently, and it has become a bright spot — somewhere she doesn’t have to think so hard about her budget.\nJudy Quivers, 56, is a frequent customer at the market, along with her 86-year-old mother, Daizia, and her 54-year-old sister Edna. Judy takes care of them both, since Edna has a developmental disability. Recently, she received a notice about potential cuts to the work program Edna takes part in everyday, which allows her to earn a small income for packing boxes of products. She’s troubled by other changes that might be coming down the pike.\n“I keep checking the news, because I know when it comes, it’s going to be rough,” Judy told STAT.\nThe family is strained as is. In addition to her job at the department of children and youth, Judy is paid through Medicaid for her caretaking work. “That extra money that I bring in working with them I use to put towards them,” she said.\nIt’s necessary. In August, the Quivers’ monthly SNAP benefits only amounted to about $10 per person, because of money Edna and Daizia get from Supplemental Security Income (which is for disabled adults and low-income seniors). They got another $10 worth of tokens to spend on produce here, so Daizia could get the ruby-red beets she likes to boil and slice for her health. But with the smaller market vouchers, they can’t shop every weekend like they used to. They supplement their diets with items from the food pantry, and try to buy bags of grains and beans in bulk when they’re on sale.\n“Most of the times, I’m coming out of my pocket to have to help,” Judy said.\nOn this day, their total at Varisano’s stand is $19, one dollar shy of their monthly SNAP allowance. By Sept. 1, that had been nearly cut in half, to $10.10 total for the family each month.\nSTAT’s coverage of chronic health issues is supported by a grant from Bloomberg Philanthropies.

        "Vice President JD Vance calls out 'left-wing radicals' for inciting political violence in social media post. Vice President JD Vance fired back on social media on Friday after being tagged in a video that appeared to mock Trump supporters over their response to the 2023 Bud Light controversy.\nThe clip, which was posted to X, showed a man shooting Bud Light cans seemingly in protest of the brand's 2023 partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney.\nThe user then took aim at Vance, telling him not to complain about \"violent rhetoric from the left.\"\nVANCE PAUSES NORTH CAROLINA SPEECH FOR BOY WHO SAID HE ‘SKIPPED SCHOOL’ TO ASK FOR A SELFIE\n\"This is how MAGA responded after Bud Lite had the audacity to feature a trans influencer in their ads,\" the X user said. \"So spare us your b------- about violent rhetoric from the left, [JD Vance].\"\nVance replied to the post, writing, \"I call upon all of our supporters to stop the violence against innocent beer cans. And I call upon all left-wing radicals to stop inciting violence against innocent people.\"\nAFTER DALLAS ICE SHOOTING, VANCE SAYS THOSE WHO DENIGRATE LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN ‘GO STRAIGHT TO HELL’\nEarlier in the week, Vance said those who denigrate law enforcement are encouraging \"crazy people to go and commit violence\" after a shooter opened fire at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility Wednesday in Dallas.\n\"You don't have to agree with my immigration policies. You don't have to agree with Donald Trump's immigration policies. But if your political rhetoric encourages violence against our law enforcement, you can go straight to hell,\" Vance said Wednesday during a trip to North Carolina. \"And you have no place in the political conversation of the United States of America.\nJIMMY KIMMEL CALLS OUT JD VANCE FOR POINTING FINGER AT THE LEFT AFTER CHARLIE KIRK ASSASSINATION\n\"If you want to stop political violence, stop attacking our law enforcement as the Gestapo. If you want to stop political violence, stop telling your supporters that everybody who disagrees with you is a Nazi. If you want to stop political violence, look in the mirror. That's the way that we stop political violence in this country.\"\nVance has also blamed the death of Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated at Utah Valley University earlier this month, on \"left-wing political radicalization.\"\n\"They tried to silence our dear friend Charlie Kirk,\" JD Vance said at Kirk's memorial. \"And, tonight, we speak with Charlie and for Charlie, louder than ever.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe Bud Light controversy in 2023 sparked massive backlash against both transgender activist Dylan Mulvaney and the beer brand.

        "Trump warns 'radical left' Democrats' 'games' could backfire after ICE Dallas attack: 'Won't take it anymore'. President Donald Trump sent a warning to the \"radical left\" Democrats on Thursday in the wake of the attack on a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Dallas, Texas, this week.\n\"Radical left rhetoric, the radical left is causing the problem,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office before singling out Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas. \"I mean, I look at Crockett, I look at some of these people, they're very low IQ people, actually.\"\nHis remarks also came in the wake of the assassination of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk in Utah earlier this month.\nTrump and Crockett have a history of butting heads, with the congresswoman referring to the president as \"wannabe Hitler\" in July 2025. She later defended the remark during an appearance on \"The Breakfast Club\" and said that it was actually Trump who has fostered a culture of political violence.\nREP. JASMINE CROCKETT DEFENDS DEM RHETORIC LIKE CALLING TRUMP 'WANNABE HITLER' IN WAKE OF KIRK SHOOTING\nTrump on Thursday went on to say, \"Bad things happen when they play these games,\" though he did not elaborate on what he meant.\nTrump warned that the \"right is a lot tougher than the left,\" while also stressing that he does not want to see people on either side of the aisle \"energized\" by violence.\n\"But the radical left is causing this, radical left Democrats are causing this problem, and it's — it gets worse, it gets worse, and it'll be a point where other people won't take it anymore,\" Trump said. \"And that will not be good for the radical left.

He was identified by sources as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn.\nFBI Director Kash Patel said Thursday the gunman sought \"real terror\" against ICE, searched for videos of Kirk's assassination and used apps that tracked ICE agents.\nPatel posted a photo of shell casings, one of which appears to have \"ANTI-ICE\" written on it in ink, allegedly found in the proximity of the shooter.\nSimilarly, ammunition allegedly used by Tyler Robinson, the suspect in Kirk’s assassination, was inscribed with anti-fascist messages, authorities said.\nProsecutors said the rifle used to kill Kirk contained three unspent rounds and one spent round, each with engravings.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nFox News Digital’s Peter D'Abrosca, Alexander Hall and Louis Casiano contributed to this report.",
        "Gavin Newsom Gives JD Vance Absolute 'Hell' Over 'Crazy' Political Violence Talk. California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) ripped Vice President JD Vance on Wednesday for pointing the finger at the left for political violence, continuing the Trump administration’s blame game in the wake of Charlie Kirk’s assassination.\nVance — in remarks following a shooting at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Dallas that killed an immigrant detainee and wounded two others — claimed the act was “politically motivated” before calling for an end to “the rhetorical assault on law enforcement.”\n“When Democrats like Gavin Newsom ... say that these people are part of an authoritarian government, when the left-wing media lies about what they’re doing, when they lie about who they’re arresting, when they lie about the actual job of law enforcement,” he began in an address in Concord, North Carolina.\n“What they’re doing is encouraging crazy people to go and commit violence. You don’t have to agree with my [or Donald Trump’s] immigration policies ... but if your political rhetoric encourages violence against our law enforcement, you can go straight to hell and you have no place in the political conversation of the United States of America.”\nICE agents weren’t injured in the shooting, per authorities, and the FBI is continuing to probe what it has called an “act of targeted violence.”\nFBI Director Kash Patel shared a photo on X that shows rounds of ammunition from the scene, including one inscribed with “anti-ICE.”\nNewsom later took to social media to decline Vance’s wicked request.\n“I will not be going ‘straight to hell’ today,” he wrote on X. “Though when I watch you speak I certainly feel like I’m already there.”\nVance — who once warned that Trump could become “America’s Hitler” — also used the speech to urge people to stop using the word “Nazi” as an insult.\nNewsom’s press office account had fun with the veep’s old rhetoric.\n“According to JD Vance, JD Vance is going to hell because JD Vance compared Trump to Hitler!” the account wrote."

        "Chevron Re-Enters Iraq's Energy Sector After More Than a Decade. Chevron Corporation CVX, a Houston, TX-based integrated oil and gas company, has officially re-established its presence in Iraq by signing an agreement in principle with the country’s Ministry of Oil. Under the direction of prime minister Mohammed Shia Al Sudani, the agreement was made public on Tuesday and describes Chevron's involvement in the development of the Nassiriya project, which encompasses the Balad oilfield, four exploration blocks and other potential upstream ventures throughout Iraq, according to Reuters.\nEnhanced energy production, sophisticated technology transfer and sustainable development in the southern Dhi Qar governorate and beyond are made possible by this agreement, which signifies a renewed cooperation between Iraq and one of the biggest oil and gas firms in the world.\nChevron’s participation in the Nassiriya oilfield commenced in 2009 when it collaborated with rivals Eni E, Repsol REPYY and Nippon Oil to submit a bid for the oilfield. Despite serious interest, negotiations failed to produce a final award at the time, leaving the Nassiriya opportunity on hold.\nThe new agreement reflects a strategic shift in Iraq’s approach to international oil companies. Prime minister Al Sudani emphasized that his government has adopted a “different approach” in dealing with global energy giants, particularly American firms, signaling a more open and investor-friendly environment.\nChevron executives, including vice president Frank Mount, were present at the signing ceremony alongside oil minister Hayan Abdul-Ghani al-Sawad, underscoring the significance of this renewed collaboration.\nThe Nassiriya oilfield represents one of Iraq’s most important untapped energy assets. According to data from previous studies and a 3D seismic survey, the field contains an estimated 4.36 billion barrels of proven oil reserves. This makes Nassiriya not only a vital project for Chevron but also a cornerstone in Iraq’s strategy to expand oil production capacity in the coming years.\nAlongside Nassiriya, Chevron will also develop the Balad oilfield, which adds to its growing footprint in Iraq’s southern oil-rich territories. Both projects are expected to bolster production levels, increase exports and bring much-needed investment into local communities.\nA key component of the agreement involves natural gas. Associated gas produced from Nassiriya and the nearby Gharraf field will be captured and integrated into the Gas Growth Integrated Project (“GGIP”), led by TotalEnergies SE TTE.\nThe GGIP is a cornerstone of Iraq’s energy transition, aimed at reducing the country’s heavy reliance on imported electricity. By capturing flared gas from three major oilfields and converting it into fuel for domestic power plants, the project seeks to improve Iraq’s energy security and cut dependence on costly imports from Iran, which currently supplies nearly a third of the former’s electricity needs.\nChevron’s expertise in gas recovery and environmental management is expected to complement the GGIP, reinforcing its role in supporting Iraq’s broader energy diversification strategy.\nChevron’s return to Iraq is not solely about boosting oil production. The company has committed to advancing technology transfer, community contributions and adherence to strong environmental policies. Prime minister Al Sudani highlighted these aspects during the signing, stressing that Chevron’s approach aligns with Iraq’s development goals.\nBy introducing cutting-edge oilfield technology, Chevron will help modernize Iraq’s upstream operations, improve efficiency and reduce emissions. Its track record in environmental stewardship and corporate social responsibility will also play an important role in building local trust and fostering long-term partnerships.\nAs the second-largest producer in OPEC, Iraq holds vast energy potential but continues to face challenges in infrastructure, electricity shortages and attracting foreign investment. Chevron’s return marks a major step in addressing these issues.\nThe agreement paves the way for exclusive negotiations between Chevron and Iraq’s Ministry of Oil, creating a framework for exploration and development projects. This structured approach will help Iraq attract additional international investment while ensuring that key projects, such as Nassiriya, move forward efficiently.\nChevron’s re-entry into Iraq carries significant economic and geopolitical weight. For Iraq, it means renewed confidence from global investors, increased production capacity and enhanced power supply. For Chevron, the agreement represents an opportunity to expand its Middle East footprint at a time when the region remains central to global oil supply.\nThe deal also highlights growing U.S.-Iraq energy ties, with Washington encouraging American companies to invest in the latter’s energy sector as part of broader economic cooperation. Iraq's collaboration with Chevron highlights its effort to balance long-standing relationships with Asian and regional investors while strengthening ties with Western companies.\nThe moves in Nassiriya and Balad mark the beginning of Chevron’s growing footprint in Iraq. As exploration advances and reserves are tapped, Iraq’s production levels could rise substantially, strengthening its role in global oil markets.\nMoreover, the integration of associated gas into the GGIP offers a pathway toward cleaner energy production and a more resilient power supply, helping Iraq reduce its reliance on imports and cut greenhouse gas emissions.\nChevron’s involvement sets a precedent for how Iraq can partner with international oil companies in a manner that balances profitability, sustainability and community impact. With vast reserves, strategic location and government support, Iraq is positioned to attract further global investment.\nChevron’s agreement with Iraq represents a turning point for both parties. By re-entering through the Nassiriya and Balad projects, the company is not only unlocking billions of barrels of proven oil reserves but also supporting Iraq’s energy diversification strategy. By implementing gas capture projects, facilitating technology transfer and committing to environmental sustainability, Chevron is set to become a transformative force in Iraq’s energy future. As Iraq seeks to boost its production capacity and modernize energy infrastructure, Chevron’s return could prove to be one of the most significant developments in the Middle East’s oil and gas sector in recent years.\nCurrently, CVX carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nInvestors interested in the energy sector might look at some better-ranked stocks like Repsol, which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and Eni, holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

        "Europe’s IPO uptick sparks hopes of a much needed rebound. Companies across the fintech, defense, software and energy sectors have either recently floated or are rumored to be eyeing an IPO in Europe.\n-\nIt follows a prolonged period of sluggishness for public listings in Europe, which has been lagging behind Asia and the U.S.\n-\n\"The September IPO activity is the quarter's standout story,\" said Bank of America's Phil Drake.\n-\nA slew of new IPOs across Europe are sparking hopes of a broader wave of public debuts in the region, despite continued private market appetite among investors.\nA number of firms — ranging from fintech to defense, and software to energy — have either recently floated or are rumored to be eyeing an IPO in Europe.\nLast week, Aumovio, the auto-parts supplier spun out from Continental, listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, for example, and Swiss Marketplace Group floated its shares on the Swiss Stock Exchange.\n\"The September IPO activity is the quarter's standout story, with issuers and private equity viewing the product as a viable exit route again in Europe,\" said Phil Drake, head of U.K. equity capital markets at Bank of America in London.\n\"We're as busy as we've been in the past 18 months,\" Drake told CNBC via email Friday. \"The IPO dialogue is ramping and secondary selldown activity will continue to be strong.\"\nChristoph Tonini, CEO of Swiss Marketplace Group, underlined the potential opportunities for existing shareholders as it went to market.\n\"The best way to make exit or participate in growth is to be in a listed company,\" Tonini told CNBC. \"That's also why you're going to see all the four shareholders remain shareholders, but they will grow together with us.\"\n\"We have now new investors coming in, and we're going to deliver, also for them, value creation,\" he added.\nThe online advertising company priced its shares at 46 Swiss francs ($57.84) each, valuing the company at $5.7 billion. Shares ended Friday at 49 Swiss francs.\nAumovio, meanwhile, began trading at 35 euro ($41.11) a share with a $4.14 billion market cap, and shares closed the week at over 39 euros.\nAumovoi's Frankfurt rollout came as Sweden's market is set to see two imminent debuts.\nVerisure, the private equity-backed Swiss alarms and security company, this week unveiled plans for a 3.1 billion euro listing on the Nasdaq Stockholm, with CEO Austin Lally saying it hoped to raise funds for international expansion.\n\"And also to pay down debt, to get the leverage levels and the balance sheet to a position where we think public investors will be comfortable, long term, supporting the company,\" Lally told CNBC on Wednesday.\nMeanwhile, NOBA, the Swedish digital banking group, has also signalled its intention for a $3.7 billion splash on Stockholm's bourse.\n\"Now we will get some more publicity, which I think we will benefit from, also in our retail offerings, of course, in relation to to people out there, but also it clearly also gives us access, more clear access to the capital markets, as I think that's that's probably very good for us,\" NOBA CEO Jacob Lundblad told CNBC last week.\nPrivate vs. public\nThe recent uptick in listings follows a prolonged period of sluggishness in Europe, which has been l the Asian and U.S. IPO markets.\nBetween January and August this year, initial public offerings in North America raised $17.7 billion across 153 deals, while Europe has managed just $5.5 billion from 57 listings, according to data from FactSet.\n\"Clearly the level of IPO has been reducing significantly,\" Henri Marcoux, deputy CEO, Tikehau Capital, told CNBC last week. He contrasted the low number of public offerings with an upsurge in appetite for private assets. \"The demand for private assets is increasing, both from private investors, private wealth, same for institutions.\"\nGerman pharma business Stada and regional bank OLB recently cancelled plans to list, opting instead for the certainty of private sales.\nHowever, Bank of America's Drake said there was evidence that investor perspectives on listings are improving.\nKey drivers of this rebound include low volatility and enhanced dollar-based returns on European equity investments due to a weakened greenback versus the euro, which is helping attract fresh U.S. capital into the continent, he said.\nAs a result, Drake said activity continued to be broad-based across sectors, \"particularly for high-quality, scale stories with attractive growth opportunities.\"\n\"What's not to like about the backdrop for equities and ECM [equity capital markets] right now?\" he added.\n— CNBC's David Martin, Michael Considine and Katrina Bishop contributed to this report.",
        "20-year-old fintech Klarna finally went public. Here's who's getting rich.. Klarna went public on Wednesday at a $15.1 billion valuation.\n-\nThe 20-year-old \"buy now, pay later\" company previously delayed its IPO plans earlier this year.\n-\nIt's the first major IPO of the fall and will soon be joined by other listings, including StubHub.\n-\nTwo decades after its founding, Klarna has gone public, and its investors are finally seeing a windfall.\nThe Swedish \"buy now, pay later\" company listed on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. Its stock popped 30% on its debut, jumping above its $40-per-share IPO price to $52 a share.\nThat IPO price gave Klarna a $15.1 billion valuation and netted Klarna $1.37 billion. Per Pitchbook, Klarna had raised $3.85 billion in its history before the public listing.\nKlarna's IPO has been a long time coming. Founded in 2005, the consumer payments company first hinted at an IPO in 2019, telling Bloomberg it could go public in the next one to two years. Klarna had reportedly planned to go public earlier this year, but delayed its IPO efforts after Trump's Liberation Day tariffs roiled the markets.\nIt's the first major IPO of the fall and is expected to be one of many companies to take the public market plunge before the end of the year. Gemini Space Station, a crypto exchange backed by the billionaire Winklevoss twins, is expected to go public later this week, and 25-year-old ticket marketplace StubHub launched its IPO roadshow Monday.\nKlarna's IPO price represents a major markdown from its peak valuation, however. The company raised $639 million in 2021 at a $45.6 billion valuation, but slashed its valuation a stunning 85% to $6.7 billion the next year as the fintech sector stumbled on rising interest rates and worsening investor sentiment.\nKlarna chairperson and former Sequoia Capital Michael Moritz criticized the company's other investors at the time.\n\"The shift in Klarna's valuation is entirely due to investors suddenly voting in the opposite manner to the way they voted for the past few years. The irony is that Klarna's business, its position in various markets, and its popularity with consumers and merchants are all stronger than at any time since Sequoia first invested in 2010,\" Moritz said in a press release about the round. \"Eventually, after investors emerge from their bunkers, the stocks of Klarna and other first-rate companies will receive the attention they deserve.\"\nKlarna debuts on the US market facing a number of headwinds, including regulatory risks and widening losses as the company sets aside more capital to cover potential losses if its customers don't pay back their loans.\nIt's been making changes to its operations, too. Klarna will require many of its previously remote employees to return to the office three days a week beginning at the end of September, in part due to Klarna losing talent to firms that prioritize in-person working, Business Insider reported last week. Klarna is also redirecting multiple employees to customer support positions after previously restructuring the business to prioritize AI chatbots handling its customer service.\nKlarna declined to comment for this story.\nWe used Klarna's share price at Wednesday's market close, $45.82, to determine the value of its major shareholders' stakes after the listing.\nWe're including the 15 shareholders with the largest stakes after Klarna's IPO. Venture firm IVP, Ant Group, and Harvest Growth Capital, other investors in Klarna listed in its IPO filing, were among the top 15 shareholders prior to Klarna's IPO, but sold enough shares in the listing to fall in the rankings. Our calculations included any extra shares that shareholders offered to meet higher investor demand.\nNow that Klarna is public, here's what those top 15 shareholders' stakes are worth.\nSequoia Capital, an investor: $3.5 billion\nVenture capital giant Sequoia Capital is the biggest benefactor of Klarna's IPO. The San Francisco-based firm Sequoia owned 78.8 million shares, or about 20.1% of the company, after its IPO.\nSequoia first invested in Klarna in 2010, leading the company's $9 million fundraise and contributing additional capital over numerous rounds in the following years.\nFormer Sequoia partner Michael Moritz joined Klarna's board of directors at the firm's 2010 investment and became the chairperson of the board in 2020.\nWhen Moritz stepped down from his investing position in 2023, Sequoia partner Matthew Morris joined Klarna's board to represent the firm. The following year, Morris, with Sequoia's backing, reportedly attempted to remove Moritz from the board altogether. After facing pushback from Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski, Morris withdrew the attempt and stepped down from the board. Sequoia partner Andrew Reed took his place. Moritz remains Klarna's chairperson today.\n\"It's amazing what an iron-willed CEO like [Sebastian Siemiatkowski], an enduring value prop, a team of true believers, and 20 years of steady (ish?) compounding can create,\" Reed posted on X Wednesday morning.\nSequoia bought an additional 7.33 million shares in Klarna between July 2022 and March 2023 for $135 million, according to Klarna's IPO filing.\nSequoia sold 2.14 million shares in Klarna's IPO, which at its $40-per-share IPO price netted the firm $85.6 million.\nAt a $45.82 closing share price, Sequoia's remaining stake is worth about $3.5 billion.\nVictor Jacobsson, cofounder: $1.38 billion\nKlarna cofounder Victor Jacobsson owned about 30 million shares of Klarna, or 8% of the company after its IPO.\nJacobsson founded Klarna in 2005 alongside Sebastian Siemiatkowski and Niklas Adalberth. He served as the company's CFO until 2012, when he left.\nJacobsson and Siemiatkowski, Klarna's CEO and the only cofounder who remains an executive at the company, have reportedly clashed in private for years over key governance decisions at Klarna, like how and when the company should go public.\nJacobsson has amassed a large stake in Klarna over the years, including by buying up shares in secondary markets through various holding companies, the Financial Times previously reported.\nBetween July 2022 and March 2023, Jacobsson bought 3,969,192 shares of Klarna for a total of $73 million across four different holding companies, per Klarna's IPO filing.\nJacobsson sold about 1.3 million shares in Klarna's IPO, which at a $40-per-share IPO price would've netted him about $52.1 million.\nAt a $45.82 share price, Jacobsson's remaining stake is worth about $1.38 billion.\nHeartland A/S, an investor: $1.36 billion\nHeartland A/S, the investment holding company owned by Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen, owned about 37.1 million shares of Klarna, or about 7.8% of the company after its IPO.\nHeartland first invested in Klarna in 2017 via Brightfolk A/S, another of Holch Povlsen's holding companies. That investment included shares bought from existing Klarna investors such as private equity firm General Atlantic and cofounder Niklas Adalberth.\nHeartland CEO Lise Kaae sits on Klara's board of directors.\nThe firm sold about 7.4 million shares in Klarna's IPO, or about 20% of its stake. At a $40-per-share IPO price, that sale brought in about $297 million.\nAt a $45.82 share price, Heartland's remaining stake is worth about $1.36 billion.\nSebastian Siemiatkowski, cofounder and CEO: $1.17 billion\nSebastian Siemiatkowski, Klarna's CEO and cofounder, owned 25.6 million shares of Klarna, or about 6.8% after its IPO.\nSiemiatkowski began building Klarna alongside his cofounders at age 23, while he was getting his master's degree at the Stockholm School of Economics. The company, initially named Kreditor and rebranded to Klarna in 2010, sought to allow customers to pay for their purchases after delivery.\nSiemiatkowski was estimated to be a billionaire in early 2022, with his net worth peaking at roughly $3.2 billion after Klarna raised a funding round the previous year at a $45.6 billion valuation. The company's fundraise in July 2022, however, valued Klarna at $6.7 billion, knocking Siemiatkowski off the billionaire pedestal.\nKlarna paid $16.5 million to nonprofits founded by Siemiatkowski's wife, including through donations and partnerships, over the last five years, BI reported last week.\nSiemiatkowski purchased an additional 3.06 million shares of Klarna for $56 million between July 2022 and March 2023. He's the only major shareholder on this list who didn't sell any of his shares in Klarna's IPO.\nAt a $45.82 price, his stake is now worth about $1.17 billion.\nCommonwealth Bank of Australia, an investor: $798 million\nThe Commonwealth Bank of Australia owned about 19.3 million shares of Klarna, or about 4.6% of the company after its IPO.\nCBA, the largest bank in Australia by total assets, first invested $100 million in Klarna in 2019. It's also backed Anthropic, announcing an investment in the AI startup giant in March.\nCBA invested an additional $200 million in Klarna in 2020, bringing its stake to 5.5%.\nAs part of its investments in Klarna, CBA received 50-50 ownership rights with Klarna to Klarna's Australian and New Zealand business.\nCBA bought an additional 1.8 million shares in Klarna between July 2022 and March 2023, according to Klarna's IPO filing, for an aggregate price of $32 million.\nCBA sold about 1.9 million shares in Klarna's IPO, which at the $40-per-share IPO price would've brought in $77.4 million.\nAt a $45.82 share price, its remaining stake is worth about $798 million.\nSilver Lake, an investor: $663 million\nPrivate equity firm Silver Lake owned 17 million shares of Klarna, or about 3.8% of the company after its IPO.\nThe Silicon Valley-based firm's other tech bets include fintech darling Stripe, business-management software company Airtable, and weight-care app Noom.\nSilver Lake led Klarna's $650 million fundraise in 2020, which valued the company at $10.6 billion.\nThe firm sold about 2.6 million shares in Klarna's IPO, netting it $102 million at a $40 IPO share price.\nAt $45.82 a share, Silver Lake's remaining stake is worth about $663 million.\nGIC, an investor: $236 million\nSingaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC Private Limited owned about 6.3 million shares of Klarna, or about 1.4% after its IPO.\nThe fund manages Singapore's foreign reserves in more than 40 countries. It's also invested in Anthropic, contributing to its September $13 billion Series F fundraise at an $183 billion valuation.\nGIC invested in Klarna's $650 million round in 2020 at a $10.6 billion valuation.\nThe fund sold about 1.2 million shares in Klarna's IPO, netting it $46.9 million at a $40 IPO share price.\nAt a $45.82 share price, GIC's remaining stake is worth about $236 million.\nHMI Capital, an investor: $204 million\nSan Francisco-based investment firm HMI Capital owned about 5.6 million shares in Klarna, or about 1.2% of the company after its IPO.\nHMI Capital manages about $3.22 billion in assets, primarily making investments in public companies including Roblox, Flutter Entertainment, and SailPoint.\nThe firm first invested in Klarna in 2019, contributing to its $460 million fundraise. HMI Capital put more money into the company in its 2020, 2021, and 2022 raises.\n\"From the outset, we believed that their vision of buy-now-pay-later offers a cheaper, friendlier alternative to credit cards. Klarna has proven that by welcoming over 110 million active consumers to its platform,\" said Justin Nyweide, founding partner and CIO of HMI Capital, in a statement to BI. \"We particularly want to congratulate CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski, Chairperson Michael Moritz and CFO Niclas Neglén for successfully bringing Klarna to market in a turbulent time. We are proud to partner with them and can't wait for Klarna to tackle the immense growth opportunity in front of them.\"\nHMI Capital sold 1.1 million shares in Klarna's IPO, which at a $TK IPO price would've brought in $44.5 million.\nAt a $45.82 share price, its remaining stake is worth about $204 million.\nBlackRock, an investor: $194 million\nBlackRock owned nearly 6 million shares of Klarna, or about 1.1% of the company after its IPO.\nBlackRock has invested hundreds of billions of dollars in Big Tech giants including Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple.

At a $40 IPO share price, that sale would've netted the firm $68.5 million.\nAt a $45.82 share price, BlackRock's remaining stake is worth about $194 million.\nUBS O'Connor, an investor: $148 million\nUBS O'Connor owned about 4.5 million shares in Klarna, or about .9% of the company after its IPO.\nUBS O'Connor is an alternative investment unit within UBS Asset Management. Per Klarna's IPO filing, its Klarna investment is held in the Nineteen77 funds that UBS manages.\nIt's not clear when UBS O'Connor first invested in Klarna. The fund did participate in Klarna's $800 million Series H fundraise in 2022, per UBS.\nIn May, UBS said it would sell its O'Connor unit, which had roughly $11 billion under management at the time, to Cantor Fitzgerald.\nThat acquisition hasn't yet closed.

        "‘Reprehensible’: Met police’s shame as hidden culture of racism and misogyny exposed by undercover colleague. ‘Reprehensible’: Met police’s shame as hidden culture of racism and misogyny revealed in undercover TV exposé\nScotland Yard chief Sir Mark Rowley has apologised after serving officers called for immigrants to be shot, revelled in the use of force and were dismissive of rape claims in an undercover BBC documentary.\nSir Mark Rowley said the behaviour of some at Charing Cross Police exposed by Panorama is “reprehensible and completely unacceptable”.\nThe Metropolitan Police Commissioner added it is likely that all the accused serving officers will be sacked within weeks of Wednesday night’s broadcast.\nNine serving officers, one ex-officer and a designated detention officer are all under investigation for gross misconduct, over allegations of use of excessive force and making discriminatory and misogynistic comments, and failing to report or challenge inappropriate behaviour.\nReporter Rory Bibb spent seven months filming covertly up to January this year.\nHe claimed Sergeant Joe McIlvenny, who has nearly 20 years’ service, was dismissive about a pregnant woman’s allegations of rape and domestic violence.\nPC Phil Neilson, while off duty referring to an immigrant who had overstayed his visa. He says: “Either put a bullet through his head or deport him.\n“And the ones that shag women, rape women, you do the cock and let them bleed out.”\nWhile off duty drinking at a pub, he also tells the journalist that Algerians and Somalians are “scum”, and makes reference to there being an invasion of the UK by migrants.\n“I think any foreign person is the worst to deal with,” he said.\n“I’ve seen too many Islamics (sic) committing crimes. Their way of life is not the correct way of life.\n“You do find that the ones that are causing the most crime are Muslim.”\nPC Martin Borg brags about a colleague stamping on a detainee’s leg, and laughs about the suspect screaming.\nHe also appears to say he offered to fill in a false witness statement about the incident.\nBorg was filmed saying: “Islam is a problem. A serious problem I think. Muslims hate us. They f***ing hate us. Proper hate us.”\nIn a separate incident, Sgt McIlvenny makes comments about a woman who has been arrested while wearing a fancy dress police outfit.\nHe also made offensive sexualised comments about a woman he had met online, and turned conversations to sex while at work, and appeared to dismiss a victim’s claim that her abusive partner had kicked her in the stomach while pregnant, and another who alleged they had been raped.\nDuring the programme one officer described how, if suspects refuse to have their fingerprints taken, he could pull two of their fingers hard to snap the tendons.\n“I love taking fingerprints by force,” he said.\nThe Met Police Federation, representing rank-and-file officers, said any staff facing allegations has a right to due process rather than trial by documentary, senior officers or politicians.\nSir Mark said: “Officers behaving in such appalling, criminal ways, let down our communities and will cause some to question if their sons and daughters are safe in our cells, and whether they would be believed and respected as victims of crime.\n“For that, I am truly sorry.\n“In line with our uncompromising approach, within 48 hours of these allegations being received, nine officers and one staff member had been suspended, with two more officers removed from frontline duties.\n“It’s my expectation that for those involved, where there is incontrovertible evidence of racism, misogyny, anti-Muslim sentiment or bragging about excessive use of force, they will be put on a fast-track hearing within weeks and on a path to likely dismissal.”\nHe has been backed by London mayor Sir Sadiq Khan, who said he has confidence in Sir Mark’s efforts to kick wrongdoers out of the Met, and that he is “disgusted and appalled” by the alleged behaviour.\nSir Sadiq said: “When I was informed of the appalling police behaviour that would be exposed by BBC Panorama, I knew it would be difficult to watch.\n“But nothing can prepare you for seeing this kind of footage.\n“It was sickening to watch police officers - those who are tasked with keeping our communities safe - display such blatant racism, misogyny, anti-Muslim hatred and excessive use of force.\n“I know that I won’t be alone in feeling angry, disgusted and let down.”\nOn Tuesday, watchdog the Independent Office for Police Conduct, which has launched its own inquiry into the claims, said that 11 current and former officers were under investigation for potential gross misconduct.\nOne constable was also under criminal investigation, accused of perverting the course of justice.\nThe alleged incidents are said to have occurred while those said to have been involved were both on and off duty between August 2024 and January 2025.\nMessages shared are understood to include support for far-right activist Tommy Robinson and anti-Muslim sentiment.\nThe entire custody team at Charing Cross has been disbanded and moved elsewhere in the wake of the allegations, which emerged after an investigation by Panorama.\nNine officers at the centre of the claims have been suspended while the IOPC inquiry continues.\nSir Mark took up the post three years ago tasked with cleaning up the force at arguably one of the most troubled times in its history.\nHe vowed to kick wrongdoers out of the Met in the wake of the murder of Sarah Everard by a serving officer, and another being unmasked as a serial rapist who targeted victims over nearly 20 years.\nEarlier this month the force said it was using “Al Capone” style tactics to root out wrongdoers and break-up cliques within the ranks.\nSir Mark added: “Having cleared out huge volumes of unsuitable staff over recent years, we are now probing deeper into the corrupt networks and cliques our actions have driven underground.\n“We are hardening our policies, such as bringing membership of secret societies into the light, and deploying AI and analytical intelligence technologies to spot early signs and troubling trends in our staff’s behaviour.\n“The vast majority of our people join policing with a vocational sense of public duty.\n“We’ll support even more staff to report wrongdoing and we will equip and develop our leaders to help them succeed in driving lasting cultural change.\n“Those who can’t or won’t improve should expect to leave.”\nThe force is consulting on plans to force officers to declare if they are members of the Freemasons.\nHome Secretary Shabana Mahmood said: “The disturbing scenes in this footage are sickening. We have given police chiefs the powers to automatically sack officers who fail background checks and dismiss those guilty of gross misconduct, and we expect them to be used.”\nFormer temporary Nottinghamshire chief constable Sue Fish reviewed Panorama’s footage and said sexualised comments were “completely inappropriate, very misogynistic”.\nDiscussing his comment about the rape and domestic violence allegations, she said: “As a woman as well as a former police officer, individuals like him have the power to make these sorts of decisions about my safety or other women's safety and that is terrifying.”\nPaula Dodds, chairwoman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said: “The federation deplores any discriminatory behaviour in the strongest possible terms – such behaviour has no place in policing or society.\n“If officers are proven to be guilty of criminal offences or serious gross misconduct, then we do not want these individuals in the job.\n“But all police officers – like all people – have the right to representation and due process, and not trial by media or documentary. Or indeed senior officers or politicians.”\nSeparate, earlier allegations linked to Charing Cross police station led to Sir Mark’s predecessor, Dame Cressida Dick, leaving her job, after London mayor Sadiq Khan said he could no longer support her.\nA 2022 report by the IOPC found officers had exchanged highly offensive messages, including repeated jokes about rape, domestic violence and violent racism, as well as homophobic language and derogatory terms for disabled people.\nThe IOPC took the unusual step of publishing the messages in full and said the behaviour it had uncovered was “disgraceful”.",
        "Nine Met police suspended amid inquiry into claims of excessive force. Nine Scotland Yard officers have been suspended after an investigation was launched into claims of excessive use of force and the making of discriminatory and misogynistic comments.\nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said the allegations centre on Charing Cross police station in central London, the source of a previous scandal for the Metropolitan police.\nThe new investigation concerns 11 current or former Met officers and one staff member based at the station. They include nine serving officers, a former officer and a serving detention officer who is a member of police staff.\nThe officers’ ranks ranged from police constable to sergeant, the police watchdog said. The IOPC said: “The allegations include excessive use of force, making discriminatory and misogynistic comments, and failing to report or challenge inappropriate behaviour, and are alleged to have occurred both on and off duty between August 2024 and January 2025.”\nThe claims of excessive use of force involve alleged actions while on duty. So far the allegations are not thought to centre on WhatsApp groups. The Met said the allegations, if true, amounted to “criminality and misconduct” and would be “disgraceful”.\nThe force added that it was taking immediate and assertive action, including dismantling the current custody team at Charing Cross station and “significantly changing the leadership in our custody command and the Westminster [borough] leadership team”.\nAn IOPC report in 2022 revealed graphic details of officers sharing messages about hitting and raping women, the deaths of black babies and the Holocaust. At the time the officers were based mainly at Charing Cross, with the offending behaviour of 19 individuals taking place between 2016 and 2018.\nThe Met’s handling of the scandal, with one officer being promoted, contributed to the ousting of the former Met commissioner Cressida Dick. Her successor, Mark Rowley, has vowed to transform the culture of Britain’s biggest police force.\nThe new allegations, which follow an undercover investigation by BBC News, are a further embarrassment to the Met leadership. The rapid suspensions led the force to refer the case to the IOPC. As yet neither the Met nor IOPC has the evidence containing the allegations in their possession.\nThe IOPC said it had also received a referral from another force about the conduct of an officer who was previously based at Charing Cross and had since transferred out of the Met.\nSadiq Khan, the mayor of London, who, along with the home secretary, has oversight of the Met, said he was “appalled” by the claims. His spokesperson said: “Sexism, racism and misogyny must have no place in the police, and [Khan] has spoken to the commissioner directly today about this matter.\n“The mayor has been consistent that there must be zero tolerance of this kind of behaviour, and there can be no hiding place for those who abuse their position of trust. The mayor will continue to work with and hold the commissioner to account to ensure Londoners get the police service they deserve.”\nThe Met assistant commissioner, Matt Twist, said: “The behaviour as reported is disgraceful and nine officers were suspended within 24 hours of the allegations being assessed and another two officers have been removed from frontline duties.\n“We are scrutinising more widely the leadership and culture within these teams, led by professional standards and senior leaders, to root out any further failings. The leadership of these teams failed to create the right culture that identified warning signs or generated confidence in junior colleagues to report. This is one of the reasons we are taking such assertive exceptional action.”\nTwist added: “The Met’s leadership has been very clear that it will not tolerate behaviour that fails to meet the organisation’s standards of professionalism and integrity. “We have already taken immediate action and this will continue over the coming days as we assess the full implications.”\nThe IOPC director Amanda Rowe said: “These are concerning allegations involving a large number of individuals and we understand there will be public concern, particularly in light of our previous investigation into similar allegations at the same police station.\n“We want to reassure the public that we will carry out a robust, independent investigation.”",
        "Metropolitan police officer arrested after undercover BBC investigation. A serving Metropolitan police officer has been arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice, after undercover footage showed colleagues at Charing Cross police station making racist and sexist comments.\nThe footage, gathered for a BBC Panorama documentary, appears to show officers at a central London station calling for immigrants to be shot and boasting about using violence against suspects.\nThe Met confirmed that a sergeant attached to the Central West Basic Command Unit was arrested following an “incident” on 2 October. The officer has since been bailed and suspended from duty.\nA force spokesperson said: “The allegation relates to an incident that took place at Charing Cross police station on 2 October and is linked to matters disclosed in BBC Panorama.\n“The investigation is ongoing so it would not be appropriate to go into further detail at this time.\n“The Independent Office for Police Conduct, which is independently investigating allegations in relation to Charing Cross, has been informed.”\nDeputy assistant commissioner Andy Valentine said: “We have been extremely clear we will be unrelenting in our approach to tackling issues at Charing Cross, and anywhere else across the Met.\n“This fresh matter came to light through our internal reporting mechanisms and we continue to encourage and support all our officers and staff to report allegations of criminal and misconduct behaviour so we can act swiftly.\n“Professional standards officers immediately acted to make the arrest and the officer has been suspended from duty.\n“We will not hesitate to take rapid action around any further allegations, as part of our deeper probe into corruption and ridding the Met of those who are not fit to serve the people of London.”\nReacting to the documentary earlier this week, Keir Starmer said: “I’ve not yet seen the footage, but I’ve had it described to me, and it’s shocking, and I’m glad the commissioner is responding. He needs to be very robust in his response.”\nThe Met commissioner, Mark Rowley, said people in London could trust the “vast majority” of its officers, and added he was “horrified” by the documentary.\nNine serving officers, one former officer and one detention officer are under investigation for gross misconduct by the Independent Office for Police Conduct.\nAllegations include excessive use of force, making discriminatory and misogynistic comments and failing to report or challenge inappropriate behaviour.\nThe documentary footage shows one officer, PC Phil Neilson, referring to an immigrant who had overstayed his visa, saying: “Either put a bullet through his head or deport him. And the ones that shag women, rape women, you do the cock and let them bleed out.”\nWhile drinking at a pub off-duty, he also told undercover reporter Rory Bibb that Algerians and Somalians are “scum”, and claimed there was an “invasion” of the UK by migrants.\nAnother officer, PC Martin Borg, bragged about a colleague stamping on a detainee’s leg and laughed about the suspect screaming.\nHe also appeared to say he offered to fill in a false witness statement about the incident."

        "Emma Hayes: ‘I don’t think coaches are always thought about as human beings’. With hands raised eagerly, the children from Abbott Community primary school want to quiz the USA head coach. The plan was for Emma Hayes to take just a few questions from the youngsters at the National Football Museum, but she wants to answer them all. Even her son, Harry, watching on, raises a hand. The tone is light, fun and educational as Hayes celebrates induction into the Hall of Fame.\nThe former Chelsea manager, who is being honoured by the museum for her coaching achievements, not least her seven Women’s Super Leagues titles and Olympic gold medal, is quick to point to how glad she is that the “women’s game is in a better place in this country” compared with when she took the Chelsea job in 2012. Alongside her smiles, though, there is a deep sadness. When later sitting down to speak to the Guardian, Hayes has words of warning for the sport: namely that it must learn lessons from the death of her predecessor at Chelsea, Matt Beard, after the shock news of his death aged 47 last month.\n“It’s a football community in mourning. It’s a huge loss,” Hayes says. “Mental health is a silent killer and coaches are human beings, and I still think we’ve got a lot of work to do to support more than just players. The LMA [League Managers Association] do a great job but, as the women’s game is growing, we have to reflect on how we support managers in the women’s game at every level, to navigate the pressures and the expectations.\n“We’ve entered an age in social media where people get ‘cancelled’ really quickly. It’s easy to criticise and I don’t think coaches are always thought about as human beings. I feel sad that he was in that position where he needed help and support from everyone, but that has to be a learning [for football]. I’m just devastated for his family and for everyone that’s played for him.”\nHayes continues: “He gave so much to the women’s game and so much to all of us, in different ways. He was always on the end of the phone if you needed a chat. His players loved him because he cared about them deeply. He will be remembered most not just for his winning at Liverpool, but for the human being that he was.”\nHayes knows Beard – who led Chelsea to their first women’s FA Cup final in 2012 before going on to win back-to-back titles at Liverpool – is a key part of the London club’s history, and her team went on to build on those foundations. Now she is delighted to see her successor at Chelsea, Sonia Bompastor, remain unbeaten in the WSL since taking over in the summer of 2024. “The marker for me wasn’t the trophies; it was that I could leave a team that could keep on winning,” Hayes says. “Sonia is doing an amazing job, and Paul Green [Chelsea’s head of women’s football], who deserves so much credit for what he’s done. [It is] why Chelsea are still at the top.”\nHayes is similarly thinking about the future for the USA national team as she points to the importance of their youth sides when discussing her love for her latest job. The 48-year-old is also enjoying the work-life balance that comes with international management. “I’ve been so well received out there, they genuinely do love English people in America,” she says. “I feel they’ve adopted me and they look after me, I feel really loved.\n“I’m enjoying having a little bit more brain time in between, so I can think strategically about doing things instead of having a game every three days. I can plan medium-to-long term within the federation, to chart a course for not just the women’s national team but with our youth national teams, for how USA continues to compete at the top end.”\nHayes would not be drawn on her hopes for the 2027 World Cup just yet. “We’ve got to qualify first, you must go one step at a time,” she says when asked about that tournament in Brazil. Her team are on a five-match winning run without conceding, though, and so she adds: “I feel like we’re in a good place. We still need more experience and that’s what we have to try to acquire in these upcoming games, getting them the right exposures at an international level so that, come the qualifications next year, we feel fully prepared, so I’m really excited about our team.”\nWhatever she goes on to achieve with the USA, Hayes’s place in English football history is secure, and being inducted into the Manchester-based museum’s Hall of Fame is clearly a moment of great pride for her. “I view football as a vehicle for good, and when I reflect on all the things I’ve done in my career to this point, the things I’m most grateful for aren’t the wins, they aren’t the individual acknowledgments, it’s the people I’ve met, it’s the foundations that have been put in place for the game,” she says. “I’m just so grateful the women’s game is in a better place in this country.”",
        "Patrick Mouratoglou: ‘Serena and I had a few fights about her weight’. Patrick Mouratoglou was notably absent from this year’s US Open. Since his breakout advising Marcos Baghdatis, who he guided to the Australian Open final in 2006, Mouratoglou has distinguished himself as a tennis guru – with pros and prospects making the pilgrimage to his academy on the French Riviera. But it was his partnership with Serena Williams, who won 10 of her 23 grand slam singles titles after pairing with the Frenchman, that helped cement Mouratoglou as a coaching great.\nIn between touring clients at the moment, Mouratoglou caught up with me near the end of the US Open to talk about Naomi Osaka’s resurgence, Williams’s weight loss and what it will take to break Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner’s duopoly in the men’s game.\nWhy was the partnership with Serena so successful? What was it that the two of you were able to bring out of each other that took her already incredible tennis to its highest ever level?\nBig trust on both sides – like, really, full trust. We were feeding each other in terms of motivation. I [knew] her perfectly, how to push her, motivate her, provoke her to be more competitive. We got started during a difficult period. She hadn’t won a grand slam for two years and suffered a first-round loss in a slam for the first time in her career [to Virginie Razzano at the 2012 French Open]. When something like this happens, even the best competitors they start to think a bit differently – and that hurts their quality when they compete.\nRoland Garros was the most difficult tournament for her, and at that point she had only won it once, in 2002. [At the start of] 2013, after we got her back to No 1 in the world, she told me, “I really want to win it again. Can you make a plan for me?” So we did some things that maybe sound a bit crazy. Going into Madrid, our tune-up for Roland Garros, I told her: “If you want to win this tournament, you have to do it serving only second serves, because I don’t want you getting any free points.” It forced her to work every point from the first to the last match, and gave her so much confidence about playing on clay [Williams posted a 28-0 clay court record that year]. Those are the types of challenges that Serena would love because she was really winning a lot already.\nRecently, Serena has been on a US media blitz to promote a weight-loss drug and drawn criticism for undercutting her athletic achievements, much less the virtues of diet and exercise. In one interview, she said that you being hard on her about her weight factored into her decision to take a medical route to weight loss. How do you remember it?\nOh I remember it very well. It was after the pregnancy – not right after; I know these things take time. I told her: “Listen, this is not a comment on how you look. It’s not my problem.” But tennis is a sport in which you can’t afford to be overweight. First of all, the pressure on your joints and everything is so big that your chances become much higher. The second thing is it’s a sport in which you change directions all the time and with a lot of speed. Even one kilo overweight is a lot. When you go full speed in one direction with one kilo extra and then need to stop and come back, the time that you lose is really important. Just look at the best players in the world – Alcaraz, Sinner, Djokovic. Think about their movement. The weight was affecting her movement.\nIn Serena’s case, she was older – so of course the body is not going to bounce back the same as before, and the risk of injury is even bigger. We had a few fights about it. I remember she did not like when I said that because she thought I was judging her. But I kept telling her, I don’t care about your look. It’s not my job. My job is your tennis. If you want to come back to the top and make history, then we have to be very efficient on every level – including this one, which for me was the key element.\nSo now that she’s lost all this weight, are you like, Well, I wish she had done this five, six years ago?\nI’m not the type of guy who’s looking back and having regrets. But, yeah, if she would have been in this position physically, the results would have been better.\nSinner and Alcaraz look like they’re on a different level from the rest of the men’s tour. If you were coaching a guy in the tier below them, how would you get them to believe they could actually beat Alcaraz or Sinner in a slam final?\nIt’s funny that you’re saying that. When Rafa and Roger were at the top of the game, it was exactly the same situation – the [next] eight players all saying it’s impossible to win a grand slam with those two guys. When you speak about the generation of French players who were top 10 – Gaël Monfils, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Richard Gasquet – they were all saying it. But then a young Novak Djokovic came in and said: “I’m going to beat those guys and be No 1.” And everyone laughed and said: “Who’s this cocky guy?” But he ended up doing it and becoming the greatest of all time.\nSo, yes, for the moment Alcaraz and Sinner are on a different planet for sure. But your question makes a lot of sense because the guy who’s going to be in the mix with these two, if there is one, is the only guy who’s going to believe it’s possible. Actually, when I interview young players, that’s what I’m trying to figure out. When you listen to them, they all say: “I want to be No 1 in the world.” But my first question is always: What’s your plan? I need to know: How much do you believe?\nI remember when I did my interview with Coco Gauff when she first came to my academy at age 10, and leaving my office thinking her drive and self-belief was unbelievable for someone so young. And you see where she is now.\nSpeaking of talented players, the tennis world had high hopes for your coaching partnership with Naomi Osaka. Why did it end after 10 months?\nThe results weren’t good enough, which completely made sense. I think we did a lot of good things but, at least from a coaching standpoint, the one thing that you don’t master can ruin the whole thing. I think she improved so much, I was seeing it on a daily basis. And her mindset was great. But she was not performing well enough during the matches, so that was the one piece that was ruining the whole thing.\nLooking back, I didn’t do a good enough job, otherwise the results would have been there. I also think that having me as a coach was a bit heavy for her, in regards to what I did with Serena for many years. She mentioned it a few times actually, even publicly – and I didn’t find a way to take that pressure away. I think maybe that’s why she wasn’t performing. As soon as I was not in the loop, she felt probably lighter. By not having that pressure, she could express her tennis more freely. But there are no hard feelings. She’s a great competitor.\nShe may have fallen short of winning a third US Open, but she does have a lot to be proud of for making it as far as she did. What did you make of her tournament and prospects going forward?\nFirst of all, you have to speak about what Naomi did in the last two tournaments. She was also in the finals at Montreal, and that was a very close match that could’ve gone her way. I think she’s back to playing at an extremely high level and the performance she showed in these last two tournaments are quite clear. So that’s great news. I’m not surprised at all because I know how much effort she put in. When we split, I told her agent she was 100% ready – which I felt because her practice level was consistent and extremely high. She needed these breakthroughs, which she had quite fast, to probably realize that she was able to play with the best and beat them. For women’s tennis to have Naomi back in the mix is amazing. She’s one of the most iconic players of the last five years.\nInterview has been edited and condensed for clarity. Patrick Mouratoglou is working with Motorola’s Behind the Icons campaign.\n-",
        "Lynx star Collier says WNBA has ‘worst leadership in the world’ in withering broadside. Napheesa Collier came prepared for her exit interview on Tuesday, delivering a blistering statement on her thoughts on the current state of the WNBA.\nCollier, a senior member of the WNBA Players Association executive council, started her press conference calling out the WNBA and the league’s commissioner, Cathy Engelbert, for a lack of accountability.\nThe Minnesota Lynx star spoke for more than four minutes about topics including inconsistent officiating, which she feels the commissioner and the rest of the league’s leadership aren’t addressing. The Lynx were eliminated from the postseason despite their No 1 seeding, and Minnesota’s coach, Cheryl Reeve, was suspended for remarks she made about the standard of refereeing in the league afterward.\n“We have the best league in the world. We have the best fans in the world. But we have the worst leadership in the world,” the runner-up for MVP said. “Year after year, the only thing that remains consistent is the lack of accountability from our leaders. If I didn’t know exactly what the job entailed, maybe I wouldn’t feel this way.\n“But unfortunately for them, I do believe we serve a league that has shown they think championship coaches and Hall of Fame players are dispensable, and that’s fine. It’s professional sports, but I will not stand quietly by and allow different standards to be applied at the league level.”\nCollier, in her role with the WNBA union, is also involved in negotiations with the league over a new collective bargaining agreement. She claimed on Tuesday that Engelbert had made remarks about the league’s young stars during preliminary CBA talks earlier this year.\n“This past February, I sat across from [Engelbert] and asked how she planned to address the officiating issues in our league,” Collier said. “Her response was, ‘Well, only the losers complain about the refs.’ I also asked how she planned to fix the fact that players like [Clark, Angel Reese and Paige Bueckers], who are clearly driving massive revenue for the league and are making so little for their first four years.\n“Her response was, ‘[Clark] should be grateful. She makes $16m off the court because without the platform that the WNBA gives her, she wouldn’t make anything.’ And in that same conversation, she told me, ‘Players should be on their knees, thanking their lucky stars for the media rights deal that I got them.’”\nCollier said she was also annoyed she hadn’t heard from Engelbert after her injury in Game 3 of the WNBA semi-finals.\n“Not one call, not one text. Instead, the only outreach has come from her number two telling my agent that she doesn’t believe physical play contributed to injuries. That is infuriating,” Collier said. “It’s the perfect example of the tone deaf, dismissive approach that our leaders always seem to take.”\nCollier wants the league to do a better job protecting its players in the long term.\n“The league talks about sustainability. This is about sustainability. How are you going to protect your players? How are you going to make sure that we have the best products on the floor night after night, when it’s so inconsistent and people are getting hurt left and right?”\nCollier also said she was comfortable with the risk of being fined for her comments. “I’m sure they’ll fine me,” she said. “I mean, it seems like anything with free speech is fined now.”"

        "Zohran Mamdani says Fifa putting profit before fans with World Cup dynamic pricing. New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has launched a public petition against Fifa’s use of dynamic pricing for World Cup tickets, telling the Guardian that it amounts to an “affront to the game.”\nMamdani’s rise from little-known state assemblyman to heavily favored Democratic frontrunner for the mayoralty of the largest city in the United States has been one of the political stories of the year – not least because he identifies as a socialist, and has stumped for policies that most in his party either do not believe in, or are hesitant to support publicly.\nChief among Mamdani’s focuses has been affordability – and in an exclusive interview with the Guardian’s Football Weekly podcast set to drop on Thursday, he made clear that is the basis for his action against Fifa, which will stage next year’s World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada.\n“I have long been quite troubled by how the supposed stewards of the game have opted for profit time and time again at the expense of the people that love this game,” said Mamdani. “And I think what is stunning to me is these demands that we are putting forward, they are just demands that go back to what [Fifa] has done in previous World Cups. And yet what they are seeing with the World Cup here in the United States, Mexico and Canada is the prospect of increasing their revenues up close to 400% compared to what they were in Qatar.”\nMamdani dipped into World Cup history, saying that the last time the men’s World Cup was held in the United States, in 1994, tickets could be had for less than $200. Indeed, Fifa in 1993 set a low-end ticket price of $25 (worth about $56 in 2025), with the most expensive ticket to the final going for $475 (worth about $1,000 in 2025). Fifa announced that ticket prices for group games in 2026 would start at $60 and hit $6,730 for the best seat at the final, but crucially those are the figures before dynamic pricing takes effect. Both are expected to rise considerably over the course of the multi-phase sales process, which began on Wednesday.\n“There’s just no chance for so many who love this game so much to actually be able to go and see this,” Mamdani said. “This also has a real impact on the potential for the atmosphere of the World Cup and just how many fans will actually be there. Because so often the people who get the tickets quickest are not the ones who are actually the most eager to be there. They’re the ones who are the most excited at the prospect of a profit.”\nMamdani’s petition calls for Fifa to end dynamic pricing for World Cup tickets, set aside 15% of tickets for local residents, and place a cap on the amount tickets are allowed to be resold for on Fifa’s ticketing platform (Fifa will do this for games in Mexico due to local laws, but will not implement caps on its exchange for other World Cup games).\n“I think that if you don’t ask, you cannot win,” Mamdani said. “I think there’s still so many people who have not even heard of [this] affront to the game. And I’m hopeful just in the last few hours since we’ve launched this, thousands of people have added their names and we’re going to keep making the case.”\nMamdani shocked US politics when he won the Democratic nomination for New York City mayor, beating more prominent names, such as former New York governor Andrew Cuomo. However, his win has not been met with universal acclaim – including from his own party. Several prominent Democrats, including House minority leader and fellow New Yorker Hakeem Jeffries, have declined to endorse Mamdani as Cuomo has re-entered the race as an independent, alongside incumbent Eric Adams.\n“Maybe they support dynamic pricing,” Mamdani joked when asked why his victory has drawn pushback from some in his party. “There are an ever-growing number that are joining our campaign each and every day. And it’s a campaign that started at 1%. Maybe if I had to characterize it in terms of a recent upset, maybe this is the Leicester City of campaigns. And so I think there are still many that we are introducing ourselves to, but I’m excited to earn their support.”\nMamdani is a longtime soccer fan who has supported Arsenal since his childhood in Uganda, saying he had magnets of the team’s Invincibles side of 2003-04 on his fridge. He offered the “contested point” that the Gunners are the most popular team in Uganda.\n“[Former manager] Arsène Wenger was one of the first coaches to bring in a number of African players into the team,” Mamdani said. “And some of my early memories are memories of Kanu, of Lauren, of Kolo Touré, of Emmanuel Eboué, Alex Song … it has been a real part of just my life and my identity and also my willingness to internally believe in that this is the year and this is the season. It’s a good preparation for being a democratic socialist.”\nMamdani acknowledged the possibility that, as New York City mayor, he could attend the 2026 World Cup final, where he would be sat near Donald Trump. Mamdani said he expects the US president would be booed, as he was at this year’s US Open men’s final.\n“There’s no amount of censorship that can quiet the actual response of people when they see this president in person, because we’re talking about someone who is already attacking the very fabric of life in this city,” he said. “It’ll be a place where I will make the case once and again for the working-class New Yorkers that they’re leaving behind.”\nYou can listen to the full interview on Thursday’s episode of Football Weekly.\n-",
        "‘Escape From New York’: Researcher predicts NYC business exodus if Zohran Mamdani wins. Zohran Mamdani's promises to freeze rents and raise taxes on corporations could trigger a New York City business exodus, Michael Toth, a research fellow at the University of Texas at Austin's Civitas Institute, told Fox News Digital.\nBusinesses have railed against Mamdani's progressive platform since his primary win shocked the political establishment, with leaders like Gristedes CEO John Catsimatidis sounding the alarm on Mamdani's plans to open city-run grocery stores and raise taxes on the 1% if he wins in November.\n\"We have a far-left socialist mayor who's trying to take control of the epicenter of global finance,\" Toth said in an exclusive interview. \"It's like oil and water.\"\nToth, a legal commentator on economic and regulatory reform, explained why Mamdani becoming mayor would trigger a \"stampede\" of businesses out of New York City in his essay, \"Escape From New York.\"\nSOCIALIST'S NYC MAYORAL WIN SPARKS FIERCE DEBATE OVER FEASIBILITY OF RADICAL POLICY AGENDA\nThe Texas-based researcher argued that Mamdani's policies \"are obviously not what has built New York City into the city that it's become,\" through leading finance, media and communication industries.\nNYC OFFICIAL WARNS BUSINESSES WILL FLEE 'IN DROVES' IF DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST CANDIDATE WINS MAYORAL RACE\n\"If I'm a New Yorker, and I'm looking for an affordable place to live, it's not going to be in a city where Zohran Mamdani is running,\" Toth said.\nAffordability has been central to Mamdani's campaign. His platform also includes promises like fast, free buses and free childcare, contrasting his \"grassroots energy\" to his general election opponents, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Mayor Eric Adams and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa.\n\"Billionaires – and the politicians who do their bidding – have made New York City unaffordable for too many New Yorkers and now, this campaign is mobilizing tens of thousands of volunteers ready for a new kind of politics,\" campaign spokesperson Dora Pekec said in a recent statement announcing more than 230,000 campaign doors.\nBut Toth said that Mamdani is lacking a key understanding of supply and demand.\n\"He completely shortchanges how hard it is for businesses to stay afloat and to consistently bring products to their customers,\" Toth said.\n\"More supply is better for consumers,\" Toth said. \"More government mandates is worse for consumers because it drives prices up.\"\nToth said New York City's mayoral election is consequential, not just for its residents, but for Americans, arguing there could be a \"continued reorientation of the American capital markets to places like Dallas and Florida.\"\nIf New Yorkers elect Mamdani, \"these policies are going to set the city back decades,\" Toth said.\nMamdani has maintained that he doesn't like capitalism, telling CNN's Erin Burnett in June that he has \"many critiques of capitalism.\"\nWhen asked about the criticism from business leaders, particularly grocery stores owners, Mamdani told Fox News Digital it will be possible for a \"partnership\" between the city and grocery store and bodega owners, despite his plan to open five city-run grocery stores if elected mayor this November.\n\"I am interested in working with each and every New Yorker, and I've actually spoken with a number of grocery store owners and made clear to them that I both recognize, and I appreciate the work that they have done. The fact is that they are a critical part of our communities,\" Mamdani said.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nDespite Mamdani's reassurances, real estate moguls have signaled support for Adams and Cuomo recently rallied support among local business leaders as pressure mounts to consolidate support against Mamdani.\nThe latest Suffolk University CityView poll revealed that 45% of New Yorkers are very or somewhat likely to vote for Mamdani in November’s general election for mayor, with a 20-point lead over Cuomo.\nFox News Digital reached out to Mamdani's campaign for comment but did not immediately hear back.",
        "Mamdani torched over 'destructive' plan to axe NYC gifted program for kindergartners. Zohran Mamdani's New York City mayoral opponents ridiculed his plan to phase out the city's gifted program for public school kindergartners.\nMamdani, the New York City Democratic mayoral nominee, would embrace former Mayor Bill de Blasio's 2021 plan to phase out the gifted program for elementary schools if elected this November, according to The New York Times.\nMamdani said he would halt the gifted program for incoming kindergartners next fall, while former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa said they would keep it.\n\"Zohran Mamdani’s latest proposal to eliminate New York City’s Gifted & Talented program is not just another political stunt — it’s destructive and emblematic of a deeper problem in today’s Democratic Party — the surface level appearance of a solution is sufficient,\" Cuomo, who is trailing Mamdani by 18 points in the latest Fox News survey of New York City registered voters, said in a statement Thursday.\nBut Sliwa said Mamdani and Cuomo are \"two peas in a pod,\" arguing that Cuomo is a \"chameleon trying to fool New Yorkers.\" Sliwa accused the former governor of staying silent while de Blasio initially tried to phase out the gifted program in 2021.\nNEW POLL REVEALS MAMDANI STILL HOLDS COMMANDING DOUBLE-DIGIT LEAD OVER RIVALS IN NYC MAYORAL RACE\nSliwa only garnered support from 11% of New York City registered voters in the latest Fox News survey. Among registered voters, Mamdani earned 45% support, while Cuomo picked up 27%, Sliwa maintained 11% and Mayor Eric Adams had 8%.\nAdams, who like Cuomo was running as an independent, dropped out of the race last week, heating up an already contentious mayoral election.\n\"Why take away from our kids the very opportunities that helped shape your own future?\" Adams asked in response to Mamdani's plan to slash the gifted program.\nNEW POLLS REVEAL MAMDANI HAS COMMANDING LEAD OVER RIVALS WEEKS FROM ELECTION DAY\nAdams has expanded the elementary Gifted & Talented program during his tenure, a reversal of de Blasio's plan to phase out the program and stop testing 4-year-olds.\n\"The era of judging 4-year-olds based on a single test is over,\" de Blasio proclaimed at the time, likening the gifted program to \"the segregation of students if they’re labeled as ‘gifted.’\"\nBut Adams rejected that notion in a statement on Thursday, arguing it \"gave thousands of Black and Brown kids a real shot to excel.\"\n\"That’s progress we should be building on, not tearing down. Expand it to more children, not fewer. And let’s be real, you went to a specialized high school,\" Adams wrote to Mamdani on X on Friday.\nMamdani attended the Bronx High School of Science, a specialized high school in the Bronx. His campaign did not respond to Fox News Digital's comment request.\nWhen asked to clarify his position on the program during a press conference on Friday, Mamdani clarified that kindergartners, specifically, should not be separated by a test.\n\"For kindergartners, we should not have a Gifted & Talented program that is separating them on the basis of that assessment,\" Mamdani said, without elaborating on his stance on the Gifted & Talented entry point for third-graders.\nAdams' plan includes two entry points into the Gifted & Talented program: kindergarten and third grade.\n\"My commitment is solely on the question of kindergartners,\" Mamdani said.\nBut Mamdani told The New York Times that he would renew de Blasio's plan, which sought to eliminate the Gifted & Talented test, opting for a universal test in second grade.\n\"I will return to the previous policy. Ultimately, my administration would aim to make sure that every child receives a high-quality early education that nurtures their curiosity and learning,\" Mamdani said.\nIn a statement released Thursday, Cuomo said, \"Our kids deserve clarity, not chaos, when it comes to their education.\"\n\"If there are tens of thousands of applications for limited G&T spots, parents are telling you something: They want more of it, not less. The answer isn’t to say good riddance to those families. If there are issues with how young children are selected, then fix that and expand opportunities — give more at the start of education and more on-ramps later. Don’t eliminate the program,\" Cuomo said.\nThe former governor said \"eliminating opportunities for excellence doesn’t help underserved kids, it perpetuates the problem,\" adding that the Democratic Party has a tradition of providing \"more opportunities for historically marginalized students to access these programs.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nCuomo said, if elected mayor, he wants to double the number of specialized high schools in New York City, expand prep programs for underserved neighborhoods and preserve the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test."

So, he took what seemed like two big problems, according to those politicians, and came up with an obviously barbaric solution to solve both problems: by letting the poor sell their kids as food. This really only was designed to highlight the barbaric framing of the “problem” by the Irish elite.\nBut, sometimes, there really are scenarios where there are two very real problems (not of a Swiftian nature) that might actually be in a position to be combined such that both problems are actually solved. And thus I present a non-Swiftian modest proposal: that AI companies desperate for high quality content should create funds to pay for journalists to create high quality content that the AI companies can use for training.\nLately, there have been multiple news articles about how desperate the AI companies are for fresh data to feed the voracious and insatiable training machine. The Wall Street Journal noted that “the internet is too small” for AI companies.\nCompanies racing to develop more powerful artificial intelligence are rapidly nearing a new problem: The internet might be too small for their plans.\nEver more powerful systems developed by OpenAI, Google and others require larger oceans of information to learn from. That demand is straining the available pool of quality public data online at the same time that some data owners are blocking access to AI companies.\nSome executives and researchers say the industry’s need for high-quality text data could outstrip supply within two years, potentially slowing AI’s development.\nThe problem is not just data, but high-quality data, as that report notes. You need the AI systems trained on well-written, useful content:\nMost of the data available online is useless for AI training because it contains flaws such as sentence fragments or doesn’t add to a model’s knowledge. Villalobos estimated that only a sliver of the internet is useful for such training—perhaps just one-tenth of the information gathered by the nonprofit Common Crawl, whose web archive is widely used by AI developers.\nThe NY Times also published a similar-ish story, though it framed it in a much more nefarious light. It argued that the AI companies were “cutting corners to harvest data for AI” systems. However, what the Times actually means is that AI companies believe (correctly, in my opinion) that they have a very strong fair use argument for training on whatever data they can find.\nAt Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, managers, lawyers and engineers last year discussed buying the publishing house Simon & Schuster to procure long works, according to recordings of internal meetings obtained by The Times. They also conferred on gathering copyrighted data from across the internet, even if that meant facing lawsuits. Negotiating licenses with publishers, artists, musicians and the news industry would take too long, they said.\nI’ve discussed the copyright arguments repeatedly, including why I think the AI companies are correct that training on copyright-covered works shouldn’t be infringing. I also think the rush to rely on copyright as a solution here is problematic. Doing so would only enrich big tech, since smaller companies and open source systems wouldn’t be able to keep up. Also, requiring all training to be licensed would effectively break the open internet, by creating a new “license to read.” This would be bad.\nBut, all of this is coming at the same time that journalism is in peril. We’re hearing stories of news orgs laying off tons of journalists. Or publications shutting down entirely. There are stories of “news deserts” and how corruption is increasing as news orgs continue to fail.\nThe proposed solutions to this very real problem have been very, very bad. Link taxes are even more destructive to the open web and don’t actually appear to work very well.\nBut… that doesn’t mean there isn’t a better solution. If the tech companies need good, well-written content to fill their training systems, and the world needs good, high-quality journalism, why don’t the big AI companies agree to start funding journalists and solve both problems in one move?\nThis may sound similar to the demands of licensing works, but I’m not talking about past works. Those works are out there. I’m talking about paying for the creation of future works. It’s not about licensing or copyright. It’s about paying for the creation of new, high-quality journalism. And then letting those works exist freely on the internet for everyone.\nIt was already mentioned above that Meta considered buying a book publisher. Why not news publishers as well? But ownership of the journalists shouldn’t even be the focus, as it could raise some other challenges. Instead, they can just set up a fund where anyone can apply. There can be a pretty clear set of benefits to all parties.\nJournalists who join the programs (and they should be allowed to join multiple programs from multiple companies) agree to publish new, well-written articles on a regular basis, in exchange for some level of financial support. It should be abundantly clear that the AI companies have no say over the type of journalism being done, nor do they have any say in editorial beyond the ability to review the quality of the writing to make sure it’s actually useful in training new systems.\nThe journalists only need to promise that anything they publish that receives funding from this program is made available to the training systems of the companies doing the funding.\nIn exchange, beyond just some funding, the AI companies could make a variety of AI tools available to the journalists as well, to help them improve the quality of their writing (I have a story coming up soon about how I’ve been using AI as a supplemental editor, but never to write any content).\nThis really feels like something that could solve at least some of the problems at both ends of this market. There are some potential limits here, of course. The AI companies need so much new content that it’s unclear if this would create enough to matter. But it would create something. And it could be lots of somethings. And not only that, but it should be pretty damn up-to-date somethings (which can be useful).\nThere could be reasonable concerns about conflicts of interest, but as it stands today, most journalism is funded by rich billionaires already. I don’t see how this is any worse. And, as suggested, it could be structured such that the journalists aren’t employees, and it could (should?) have explicit promises about a lack of editorial control or interference.\nThe AI companies might also claim that it’s too expensive to create a large enough pool, but if they’re so desperate for good, high-quality content, to the point of potentially buying up famous publishers, then, um, it seems clear that they are willing to spend, and it’s worth it to them.\nIt’s not a perfect solution, but it sure seems like one that solves two big problems in one shot, without fucking up the open web or relying on copyright as a crutch. Instead, it funds the future production of high-quality journalism in a manner that is helpful both for the public at large and the AI companies that could contribute to the funding. It also doesn’t require any big new government law. The companies can just… see the benefit themselves and set up the program.\nThe public gets a lot more high-quality journalism, and journalists get sustainable revenue sources to continue to do good reporting. It’s not quite a Swiftian modest proposal, in that… it actually could make sense.\nFiled Under: a modest proposal, ai, copyright, generative ai, journalism, link taxes, llms, training, training data\nCompanies: google, meta, openai\nComments on “An Only Slightly Modest Proposal: If AI Companies Want More Content, They Should Fund Reporters, And Lots Of Them”\nRespectfully, I question the effectiveness of this proposal.\nIf I’m an AI company in search of quality content to train my AI on, and I’m willing to pay journalists to make said content, wouldn’t I just lay off said journalists once I’m satisfied that they’ve provided enough content for my AI? As my AI gets more quality data to train off of, my need for those journalists will gradually decline until I no longer consider funding them to be worth it.\nLikewise, if I’m a journalist, my content would be used to train a machine that is ultimately cheaper than me and can produce far more content than me–and thus could force me to seek a different line of work. If quality’s the only advantage I have over an AI, why would I deprive myself of it? Also, why should I trust an AI company to keep me around once they’re satisfied that their AI’s content is of sufficient quality?\nRe:\nYou’re assuming that an AI company is going to be satisfied with one model. We’ve already seen GPT-4.\nBesides which, are AIs really going to interview people? Research print records? Drill down to find the truth in a situation? Those seem like awfully hard things for a glorified language database to accomplish.\nRe: Re:\nAre those things AI can do today? Probably not (except for the “research print records” part). It would be foolish to assume machine intelligence will never be able to, though, given the rapid rate of improvement in the field.\nRe:\nYou are aware this is satire, as indicated by the reference to johnsthan swift’s “modest proposal?”.\nRe: Re:\nIt is not satire, as evidence by the lines “But, sometimes, there really are scenarios where there are two very real problems (not of a Swiftian nature) that might actually be in a position to be combined such that both problems are actually solved. And thus I present a non-Swiftian modest proposal”\nRe: Re: Re:\n‘Not Swift’ =/= ‘not satire’, actually. Just as ‘not Grey’s Anatomy‘ =/= ‘not medical drama’.\nRe: Re:\nThe article seems to be explicitly saying it’s not: But, sometimes, there really are scenarios where there are two very real problems (not of a Swiftian nature) that might actually be in a position to be combined such that both problems are actually solved. And thus I present a non-Swiftian modest proposal:\nKind of a weird framing to invoke Swift if it’s not actually satire, though.\nRe: Re: Re:\n‘Not Swift’ =/= ‘not satire’, actually. Just as ‘not Grey’s Anatomy’ =/= ‘not medical drama’. Shame on you, link tax shill.\nRe: Re: Re:2\nIn general, yes. In this case, with this wording, no, actually.\nIt’s not quite a Swiftian modest proposal, in that… it actually could make sense.\nPretty darn clear, AC who can’t read.\nRe: Re: Re:3\nAnd Swift’s Modest Proposal could make sense to people with a barbaric cast of mind. Your point, link tax shill who doesn’t demonstrate empathy for the little guy?\nRe: Re: Re:3\nHow many times has it been said on this site that even if people don’t see the humor in satire, that doesn’t mean it’s not satirical? And you accuse AC of being unable to read! Wow, you’re such a hypocrite!\nRe: Re: Re:\nIn respect to the narrative about AI, that the Capitalists investing in AI are not simply looking for tools to replace people, funding journalism is the obvious solution to a need for more and better quality training data.\nIn respect to the actual motivations of profit driven Capitalists investing in AI, the purpose is to replace journalists with lower cost/article LLMs spewing ‘content’ out at impossibly high rates to feed low effort click farming. In this world, as the original poster highlighted, the entire idea is a satire. An absolute joke. Its not a serious proposal in any sense, because paying journalists is the opposite of the goal of the use of AI. If adopted it would, as implied by the original comment, result in the journalism world cannibalizing itself, journalists eating their own future to survive today. (Possibly a reason to invoke swift? just maybe?)\nThis proposal is not swiftian satire. Swift was not seriously proposing eating babies, and that should be obvious to all audiences. Swift was exaggerating the callous attitudes toward Ireland to subject that attitude to ridicule. But not all satire operates this way. Some satire uses irony and the ironic contrast between an obvious serious solution and the barriers imposed by the reality of profit driven motives similarly serves to expose the gulf between stated motives and the actualities.\nRe: Re: Re:2\nNow this is a much more nuanced (and accurate) response than “Not Swift, so not satire. Ug.”\nRe:\nKind of feels like the concept of trickle down economics, they could use the wealth they’ve accumulated to benefit all mankind/fund people to make quality content to fuel the machine… They won’t, we know they won’t, this never happens in the real world and no amount of think pieces suggesting it is going to make it so. The entire point of AI is to eliminate human jobs and create a new set of kings at the expense of everyone who works in a creative field, they’re not even trying to hide that fact.\nThe goal of AI is to do it cheaper, not better, no matter the cost to humanity.\nRe:\nNo, it isn’t. Companies are in business to make a profit. If they can make a profit, and do some good at the same time, so much the better. AI companies think they’re making something useful, that people will be willing to pay for. Presumably, AI will be used by companies to increase efficiency, but to say that’s AIs goal is totally misunderstanding things.\nRe: Re:\n” If they can make a profit, and do some good at the same time, so much the better.”\nMost business is not going to try to make things better.\n“AI companies think they’re making something useful,”\nhaha, good one. The usefulness is not a concern.\n“AI will be used by companies to increase efficiency”\nNo it will not. Like most new shiny objects, it will loose its luster ending up in the attic next to the thigh master and quadraphonic.\nRe: Re: Re:\nActually, usefulness is a concern because AI companies know if what they make isn’t useful, they’re more than likely to lose money to a competitor whose software people do find useful.\nRe: Re: Re:2\n“companies know if what they make isn’t useful, they’re more than likely to lose money”\nCompanies loose money all the time, they seem to lack concern.\nRe: Re: Re:3\nReading comprehension, ch… Oh, wait. No.\nRe: Re: Re:3\nYou seem to have an unusually short attention span. Go seek an assessment for ADHD and see if there’s any treatment available for that.\nRe: Re:\nWelcome back from your 500 year coma, we have this thing called Wikipedia now, while not perfect you can skim through an get a good glimpse at how capitalism has gone in the time you’ve been asleep… Not good, as it happens. Not a lot of time and effort put into doing good, and the people super into AI gutting creative fields now are really pissed at anyone so much as perceived as trying to do the right thing by other humans, to the point they use the terms for equality programs to cover for slurs. Funny how that goes.\nThe problem with the plan of “hire a lot of high-quality journalists” is that there have never been a lot of high-quality journalists.\nI direct your attention Knoll’s Law: “everything you read in the newspapers is absolutely true, except for the rare story of which you happen to have firsthand knowledge”. There was no golden age where journalism was high-quality and reliable. Even ostensible industry leaders like the NYT, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal routinely pushed complete nonsense and/or propaganda long before the internet came along.\nThe reason newspapers and local TV news have taken a big hit from the internet isn’t because of big tech meanies. It is because the actual business of newspapers and local TV news has always been “producing thinly-researched swill to draw in eyeballs for the advertisers”, and these days you can get thinly-researched swill for free.\nRe:\ni’d roughly agree with some of that, but journalism is way the hell bigger than newspapers and tv news.\n(I have a story coming up soon about how I’ve been using AI as a supplemental editor, but never to write any content).\nNot good enough to write articles but good enough to edit? That makes sense\nSo what you’re saying is, feeding the output of other AI systems into your AI system isn’t going to cut it.\nAnd here I was expecting an AI Oroboros: AI feeding AI feeding AI until it all collapses into a single word: Nazi.\nDefinitely thinking outside the box\nThe AI companies probably wouldn’t even want editorial control. That’s not their expertise. However, they’re probably going to insist that the editorial control come from someone other than the brunch-lords you keep writing about.\nLet's do some math:\nAccording to this reuters article, big tech will pay\nhttps://www.reuters.com/technology/inside-big-techs-underground-race-buy-ai-training-data-2024-04-05/\nBut instead, consider the price for quality journalism. You can create words for basically free these days, but to gather real human experiences into words, at $0.001 per word? I doubt I could string together $100 worth of income, or 100,000 words per day, at those rates. Reddit says that the average journalist writes around ~1000 words a day. Now, it sounds like this will be high quality data, but on the other hand, you’re going to be paying a hefty price per word of training data.\nWhile this sounds like a great idea at first, I’m not sure if this scheme would make sense for either AI companies or journalists. AI companies may be rich, but I don’t know if they are rich enough to subsidize the entire cultural industry.\nOn the other hand, some back of the envelope math says that AI might increase GDP by ~7% according to Goldmann Sachs, compared to the ~2.3% that the cultural industries currently occupy. I don’t know how much of that increase will be captured by AI companies in the form of fees and stuff, but I think it would be fair to funnel half of that to the creation of new content, much as YouTube has its famous 55% revenue split.\nIsn’t there a major issue here? If training falls under fair use, competitors can just use it to train their own models.\nIt seems like what would happen is that AI companies would hire journalists to write journalism in private, and never publish it publicly. The only way to ensure a competitor doesn’t free ride on it is to make sure it never sees the light of day.\nIt is entirely possible to construct a legal regime where there is a license to train, without creating a license to read.\nThis seems like it would have the same issue, since you’d need deep pockets.\nI can’t say I see a meaningful distinction here, but if it makes people happy… sure, I guess? This feels like copyright/licensing by another name.\nRe:\nNow I understand: It’s not the link tax you shill for in particular, it’s any transfer of money from those who can’t afford it to those who don’t want to spend it (hence tax-dodging offshore accounts).\nBut Mike, Microsoft already does!\nIt’s called MSNBC.\n…Oh wait.\nRe:\nIf the above is what you were referring to, MSNBC is actually owned by Comcast, in which Microsoft sold off all of its shares in January 2009. Do try to keep up to date.\nCorporations to pay for the things/people they use? That would DEVASTATE their business model. So much easier to just buy a few more politicians…they’re much CHEAPER, after all.\nFTFY. The majority of landowners in Ireland at the time weren’t Irish, but incomers from Great Britain.\nThis would be really cheap to. I mean, how much do you have to pay for 90% of “journalists” to write clickbait horse shit with zero useful content?\nNot all, certainly, but a majority of “reporting” is clickbait ad-filled horse shit.\nWhat a load of absolute drivel.\nMike has obviously been instructed by his overlords at Google and Andreesen to viciously oppose any effort by publishers to enforce their copyrights against AI model trainers, or pass any kind of clarification to fair use in Congress.\nBut even Mike knows that he can’t insult and slam other policies 100% of the time…he needs to propose his own alternative at least once or twice a year.\nSo his idea is for big tech companies to pay a living wage to journalists to produce 2000 words a day, not compelled to by the government (obviously) but out of the goodness of their heart? Doesn’t he know how ridiculous this sounds?\nMike’s thinly veiled corporate shill policy ideas are the worst kind of joke: it would be really funny if it weren’t so damn depressing.\nRe:\nMike earns his money from this site and the Copia Institute, actually, but trust an anti-Masnick troll to be too lazy to carry out basic research before launching into an unjustified attack.\nRe:\nNice try, John Smith.\nwhy don’t the big AI companies agree to start funding journalists and solve both problems in one move? - Definitely not.\nDefinitely not – because they will end up owning the journalist and the journalist will write content with a view to continuing to be funded.\nA better solution is to\n– tax AI companies as a levy on their income, thus taxing the users of AI who are presumably not using AI for love and who are being charged by the AI companies in any event.\n– charge AI companies for the access to copyright material on a basis of negotiated access terms, including pricing.\nMaterial that is subject to copyright and is issued on the baisi of a fee-for-access is often made available at favorable terms or even free, depending on the usage to which the material is to be put e.g. academic research.\nCopyright is itself a mechanism to allow for chargin users of copyright material for it’s use. The original copyright holder, be it an author, or be it an institution which itself employs the author, obtains an income for it’s use.\nIf copyright means anything, it means that the copyright holder gets to decide who has access to copyrighted material. AI companies should therefore be obliged to obtain a license to access the copyrighted material if that is in the copyright license under which the material is made available.\nDepending on the copyright license, some material will be made available free of charge. That is the prerogative of the copyright holder as to the license he/she/they adopt(s) for his/her/their material."

        "Judge approves $1.5B copyright settlement between AI company Anthropic and authors. Judge approves $1.5B copyright settlement between AI company Anthropic and authors\nA federal judge on Thursday approved a $1.5 billion settlement between artificial intelligence company Anthropic and authors who allege nearly half a million books had been illegally pirated to train chatbots\nSAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge on Thursday approved a $1.5 billion settlement between artificial intelligence company Anthropic and authors who allege nearly half a million books had been illegally pirated to train chatbots.\nU.S. District Judge William Alsup issued the approval in San Francisco federal court Thursday after the two sides worked to address his concerns about the settlement, which will pay authors and publishers about $3,000 for each of the books covered by the agreement.

Matt O'Brien, Associated Press\nMatt O'Brien, Associated Press\nLeave your feedback\nNEW YORK (AP) — Artificial intelligence company Anthropic has agreed to pay $1.5 billion to settle a class-action lawsuit by book authors who say the company took pirated copies of their works to train its chatbot.\nThe landmark settlement, if approved by a judge as soon as Monday, could mark a turning point in legal battles between AI companies and the writers, visual artists and other creative professionals who accuse them of copyright infringement.\nWATCH: How the next wave of workers will adapt as artificial intelligence reshapes jobs\nThe company has agreed to pay authors about $3,000 for each of an estimated 500,000 books covered by the settlement.\n“As best as we can tell, it’s the largest copyright recovery ever,” said Justin Nelson, a lawyer for the authors. “It is the first of its kind in the AI era.”\nA trio of authors — thriller novelist Andrea Bartz and nonfiction writers Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson — sued last year and now represent a broader group of writers and publishers whose books Anthropic downloaded to train its chatbot Claude.\nA federal judge dealt the case a mixed ruling in June, finding that training AI chatbots on copyrighted books wasn’t illegal but that Anthropic wrongfully acquired millions of books through pirate websites.\nIf Anthropic had not settled, experts say losing the case after a scheduled December trial could have cost the San Francisco-based company even more money.\n“We were looking at a strong possibility of multiple billions of dollars, enough to potentially cripple or even put Anthropic out of business,” said William Long, a legal analyst for Wolters Kluwer.\nU.S. District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco has scheduled a Monday hearing to review the settlement terms.\nBooks are known to be important sources of data — in essence, billions of words carefully strung together — that are needed to build the AI large language models behind chatbots like Anthropic’s Claude and its chief rival, OpenAI’s ChatGPT.\nAlsup’s June ruling found that Anthropic had downloaded more than 7 million digitized books that it “knew had been pirated.” It started with nearly 200,000 from an online library called Books3, assembled by AI researchers outside of OpenAI to match the vast collections on which ChatGPT was trained.\nDebut thriller novel “The Lost Night” by Bartz, a lead plaintiff in the case, was among those found in the Books3 dataset.\nAnthropic later took at least 5 million copies from the pirate website Library Genesis, or LibGen, and at least 2 million copies from the Pirate Library Mirror, Alsup wrote.\nThe Authors Guild told its thousands of members last month that it expected “damages will be minimally $750 per work and could be much higher” if Anthropic was found at trial to have willfully infringed their copyrights. The settlement’s higher award — approximately $3,000 per work — likely reflects a smaller pool of affected books, after taking out duplicates and those without copyright.\nOn Friday, Mary Rasenberger, CEO of the Authors Guild, called the settlement “an excellent result for authors, publishers, and rightsholders generally, sending a strong message to the AI industry that there are serious consequences when they pirate authors’ works to train their AI, robbing those least able to afford it.”\nThe Danish Rights Alliance, which successfully fought to take down one of those shadow libraries, said Friday that the settlement would be of little help to European writers and publishers whose works aren’t registered with the U.S. Copyright Office.\n“On the one hand, it’s comforting to see that compiling AI training datasets by downloading millions of books from known illegal file-sharing sites comes at a price,” said Thomas Heldrup, the group’s head of content protection and enforcement.\nOn the other hand, Heldrup said it fits a tech industry playbook to grow a business first and later pay a relatively small fine, compared to the size of the business, for breaking the rules.\n“It is my understanding that these companies see a settlement like the Anthropic one as a price of conducting business in a fiercely competitive space,” Heldrup said.\nThe privately held Anthropic, founded by ex-OpenAI leaders in 2021, said Tuesday that it had raised another $13 billion in investments, putting its value at $183 billion.\nAnthropic also said it expects to make $5 billion in sales this year, but, like OpenAI and many other AI startups, it has never reported making a profit, relying instead on investors to back the high costs of developing AI technology for the expectation of future payoffs.\nStand up for truly independent, trusted news that you can count on!\nSupport Provided By:\nLearn more\nSubscribe to Here’s the Deal, our politics\nnewsletter for analysis you won’t find anywhere else.\nThank you.

        "Judge approves $1.5 billion copyright settlement between AI company Anthropic and authors. Judge approves $1.5 billion copyright settlement between AI company Anthropic and authors\nA federal judge on Thursday approved a $1.5 billion settlement between artificial intelligence company Anthropic and authors who allege nearly half a million books had been illegally pirated to train chatbots\nSAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge on Thursday approved a $1.5 billion settlement between artificial intelligence company Anthropic and authors who allege nearly half a million books had been illegally pirated to train chatbots.\nU.S. District Judge William Alsup issued the preliminary approval in San Francisco federal court Thursday after the two sides worked to address his concerns about the settlement, which will pay authors and publishers about $3,000 for each of the books covered by the agreement. It does not apply to future works.\n“This is a fair settlement,” Alsup said, though he added that distributing it to all parties will be “complicated.” About 465,000 books are on the list of works pirated by Anthropic, according to Justin Nelson, an attorney for the authors.\n“We have some of the best lawyers in America in this courtroom and if anyone can do it, you can,\" Alsup said.\nThe Association of American Publishers called the settlement a “major step in the right direction in holding AI developers accountable for reckless and unabashed infringement.”\n“Anthropic is hardly a special case when it comes to infringement. Every other major AI developer has trained their models on the backs of authors and publishers, and many have sourced those works from the most notorious infringing sites in the world,” said Maria A. Pallante, president and CEO of the publisher group.\nSan Francisco-based Anthropic said it is pleased with the preliminary approval.\n“The decision will allow us to focus on developing safe AI systems that help people and organizations extend their capabilities, advance scientific discovery, and solve complex problems. As we’ve consistently maintained, the court’s landmark June ruling that AI training constitutes transformative fair use remains intact. This settlement simply resolves narrow claims about how certain materials were obtained,” said Aparna Sridhar, deputy general counsel at Anthropic.\nThe Authors Guild, meanwhile, said the settlement “marks a milestone in authors’ fights against AI companies’ theft of their works. It sends a clear signal to AI companies that infringement of authors’ rights comes at a steep price and will undoubtedly push AI companies towards acquiring the books they want legally, through licensing.”\nA Monday filing sought to convince the judge that the parties have set up a system designed to get out robust notice to all authors and publishers covered by the agreement, ensuring they get their cut of the pot if they want to sign off on the settlement or opt out to protect their legal rights moving forward.\nThey also tried to assure him that the author and publishers group that cobbled the deal together are not doing any “back room” dealings that would hurt lesser-known authors.\nAlsup’s main concern centered on how the claims process will be handled in an effort to ensure everyone eligible knows about it so the authors don’t “get the shaft.” He had set a September 22 deadline for submitting a claims form for him to review before Thursday's hearing to review the settlement again.\nThe judge had raised worries about two big groups connected to the case — the Authors Guild and the Association of American Publishers — working “behind the scenes” in ways that could pressure some authors to accept the settlement without fully understanding it.\nAttorneys for the authors said in Monday's filing they believe the settlement will result in a high claims rate, respects existing contracts and is “consistent with due process” and the court's guidance.\nAlsup had dealt the case a mixed ruling in June, finding that training AI chatbots on copyrighted books wasn’t illegal but that Anthropic wrongfully acquired millions of books through pirate websites to help improve its Claude chatbot.\nBestselling thriller novelist Andrea Bartz, who sued Anthropic with two other authors last year, said in a court declaration ahead of the hearing that she strongly supports the settlement and will work to explain its significance to fellow writers.\n“Together, authors and publishers are sending a message to AI companies: You are not above the law, and our intellectual property isn’t yours for the taking,” she wrote.\nAlsup also said in the courtroom Thursday that he plans to step down from the bench by the end of the year.

        "Microsoft is officially sending employees back to the office. Read the memo.. Microsoft is sending employees back to the office at least three days a week.\n-\nThe first phase will be for employees who live near its Seattle-area headquarters in February.\n-\nBusiness Insider reported last month that Microsoft's was considering a stricter RTO policy.\n-\nOne of Big Tech's last remaining RTO holdouts is officially sending employees back to the office.\nMicrosoft is mandating employees work from offices at least three days a week, according to an internal email the company sent to staff on Tuesday.\nThe mandate will happen in three phases, beginning at the end of February 2026, with Seattle-area employees who live within 50 miles of a Microsoft office. It will then expand to other US offices and eventually internationally, according to the email from Microsoft HR chief Amy Coleman. February 23 was one of the start dates Microsoft considered, but it hasn't been decided yet.\nEmployees can request an exception by September 19. Coleman's email didn't include details about how such exceptions may work.\nBusiness Insider reported in August that Microsoft was considering a stricter RTO policy mandating three days a week in the office.\nMicrosoft sells software that enables remote work, such as its popular Teams workplace chat and meeting app. It remained relatively lax compared to some other Big Tech companies when it comes to RTO, especially cross-town rival Amazon. Even Zoom sent its employees back to the office part-time in 2023.\nMicrosoft first introduced a flexible work policy when it brought employees back to the office in late 2020 after pandemic-forced closures. That policy officially allowed employees to work from home at least half of the time without approval, but in practice it was even more flexible and most employees worked remotely most of the time.\nNow its policy is evolving to be similar to guidelines at Meta and Google, which generally require most employees to work in offices three days a week.\nMicrosoft's new approach is the latest sign of the company increasing performance pressure on employees. It has fired thousands of employees deemed low performers this year and introduced a new performance improvement plan meant to exit low performers more quickly.\nWhile working on the new RTO policy, Microsoft appears to have scrubbed a blog post that once heralded the benefits of remote work for retaining employees and boosting their productivity.\n\"Hybrid work is more than a change in technology—it's a change in mindset, a change in culture, and a change in the way you think about physical and virtual spaces to enable an inclusive and productive environment for all,\" Microsoft wrote, according to a snapshot of the blog retained by the Internet Archive. \"The change isn't easy, but it's worth it. If you make the time to do it right, your employees will be more engaged, more productive, and more connected, even when they're miles away. And they'll be far less likely to leave for a competitor who has a more sophisticated and flexible model than you do.\"\nThe link to that blog post now redirects to one published on July 31 calling out how \"hybrid work created new challenges for employee engagement\" and how AI can solve them.\nRead the full memo:\n\"How we work has forever changed. I remember starting at Microsoft in the late '90s, always in the office, no laptops, and primarily working with the people right down the hall. As technology evolved and our business expanded, we became more open, more global, and able to scale in ways we couldn't have imagined. Then the pandemic reshaped everything. It pushed us to think differently about work, to connect like never before (thank you Teams!), reminded us of how much we value being together, and gave us focus and autonomy in the traditional workday. We're not going back, and we shouldn't. Instead, we should take the best of what we've learned and move forward.\nIn the AI era, we are moving faster than ever, building world class technology that changes how people live and work, and how organizations everywhere operate. If you reflect on our history, the most meaningful breakthroughs happen when we build on each other's ideas together, in real time.\nWe've looked at how our teams work best, and the data is clear: when people work together in person more often, they thrive—they are more energized, empowered, and they deliver stronger results. As we build the AI products that will define this era, we need the kind of energy and momentum that comes from smart people working side by side, solving challenging problems together.\nWith that in mind, we're updating our flexible work expectations to three days a week in the office.\nWe'll roll this out in three phases: 1) starting in Puget Sound at the end of February; 2) expanding to other US locations; 3) and then launching outside the US.\nOur goal with this change is to provide more clarity and consistency in how we come together, while maintaining the flexibility we know you value. We want you to continue to shape your schedule in ways that work best for you, making in-person time intentional and impactful. Importantly, this update is not about reducing headcount. It's about working together in a way that enables us to meet our customers' needs.\nFor some of you, this is not a change. For others this may be a bigger adjustment, which is exactly why we're providing time to plan thoughtfully. As part of these updates, we're also enhancing our workplace safety and security measures so we can continue to provide a workplace where every employee can do their best work.\nWhat you need to know:\nPuget Sound-area employees: If you live within 50 miles of a Microsoft office, you'll be expected to work onsite three days a week by the end of February. You'll receive a personalized email today with more details. Please connect with your manager and team to understand your organization's plans. If needed, you can request an exception by Friday, September 19.\nManagers: You'll find actions to take, and the resources to support both you and your team on the Managers@Microsoft SharePoint.\nAll employees: You'll hear from your EVP or organizational leadership today with specific guidance. Each business will do what is best for their team, which means some groups will deviate from our company-wide expectations. If you are outside of the Puget Sound area, you do not need to take any action at this time unless your EVP communicates otherwise.\nTimelines and details for additional US office locations will be announced soon. For employees outside the United States, we will begin planning in 2026. More information is available on the Flexible Work at Microsoft SharePoint.\nAs always, we'll keep learning together to ensure Microsoft is the best place for you to grow and have a great career. Let's keep moving forward together.\nThank you,\nAmy\"\nHave a tip? Contact this reporter via email at astewart@businessinsider.com or Signal at +1-425-344-8242.

        "CDC temporarily revokes remote work approvals for employees with disabilities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has revoked permission for employees with disabilities to work from home, at least temporarily, and paused approving reasonable accommodations for new applicants seeking to work from home, according to a Sept. 15 email obtained by STAT.\nThe agency’s decision stems from the Trump administration’s January directive to mostly end remote work for federal employees and is tied to an August update to a broader Health and Human Services telework policy, which the CDC email said did not include long-term telework as an option for federal employees with disabilities.\nThe email says CDC is awaiting clarification from HHS, but meanwhile, “all approvals for long-term telework, to include reasonable accommodation (RA) long-term telework are paused until further notice.” Employees may still submit requests for reasonable accommodation and are “encouraged to reach out to their supervisor or manager for assistance with an interim solution,” according to the email from an official in the CDC’s Office of Human Resources.\nIt’s unclear how many CDC employees work remotely full time, though Yolanda Jacobs, president of AFGE Local 2883, one of the unions representing CDC workers, said that dozens of employees were affected by the withdrawal of approval for remote work.\nDisability lawyers suggested that the CDC’s action could violate the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, a landmark law that provides employment protections for federal employees with disabilities.\n“This raises serious concerns, any type of reasonable accommodation must be individualized and looking at the specific job’s duties,” said Alison Barkoff, the former head of the Administration for Community Living. “A blanket policy that telework can never be an accommodation raises serious legal concerns.”\nThis confusion over remote work started in January, when President Trump issued an executive order calling for agency heads to “terminate remote work arrangements” and require employees to return to working in person, though federal officials would later carve out telework exceptions. The uncertainty spread when everyone at the CDC who oversaw reasonable accommodations was let go as part of the major April reduction in force, at which time employees with pending requests for reasonable accommodations were given temporary approval for their exemptions, according to Jacobs.\nThere was no movement in this telework tug-of-war until Monday, when CDC employees with longstanding reasonable accommodations and others who had submitted requests were denied without explanation. Jacobs believes this policy change can be attributed to “overreach and overinterpretation” from CDC officials who were unsure of how to interpret the August policy update. It’s unclear whether other health agencies will be affected.\nHHS officials did not respond to a request for comment.\nCDC employees were not given detailed explanation for why their reasonable accommodations or requests had been withdrawn, though disability law requires that supervisors have conversations with federal employees about why they need accommodations for their specific role. One employee received an email revoking their telework accommodation at 2:23 a.m. on Tuesday, according to emails obtained by STAT. Their supervisor had not been made aware of the decision. Jacobs said that others were told to report to work the next day, disability notwithstanding.\n“That means that some employees would no longer be able to work for the agency,” she said. “You’re being told that your disability doesn’t matter.”\nSTAT’s coverage of disability issues is supported by grants from Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and The Commonwealth Fund.

        "&#8216;We gave everything&rsquo;: Afghan allies abandoned by U.S. share fears of life under Taliban. Nick Schifrin\nNick Schifrin\nSonia Kopelev\nSonia Kopelev\nLeave your feedback\nAs the American war in Afghanistan ended four years ago, thousands of Afghans who had worked with the United States, and believed in the American-led war against the Taliban, were left behind. Many of them are still there after the Trump administration suspended relocation programs. Nick Schifrin spoke with two men in Afghanistan about their fears and dark memories of the Taliban takeover.\nNotice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors.\nAmna Nawaz:\nFour years ago this past Sunday, the last American soldier walked up the ramp of the last departing military flight out of Kabul, ending nearly 20 years of the American war in Afghanistan.\nThe U.S. also left thousands of Afghans behind who had worked with the United States and believed in the American-led war against the Taliban. Many of them are still left behind after the Trump administration suspended all relocation programs.\nNick Schifrin spoke with two men still in Afghanistan about the fear they live with today and the dark memories from the Taliban takeover.\nNick Schifrin:\nFour years ago, a community forsaken. Thousands of Afghans flooded Kabul Airport, desperate to flee. And many, having worked with the U.S., begged American soldiers for a chance to keep their freedom.\nMan:\nI have all documents to go to U.S.\nAs the Taliban took back Afghanistan and after two decades, the United States withdrew.\n\"Mohammad,\" Former Humanitarian Coordinator: That was very, very bad scenario for us, not only for my family, but all the Afghans, especially those who worked with international India and for the U.S. During that time, we have to say we lost our hope.\nThis is a man we will call Mohammad, who's still in Afghanistan and whose identity we are concealing and voice we are altering. He was a humanitarian coordinator for more than 20 years. He worked with USAID, the U.N. and others to promote women's rights, expand education, and bring together community leaders from across the country to build peace.\nWhat were you trying to accomplish by helping the U.S. and the U.N. in Afghanistan?\n“Mohammad”:\nThe United States tried to develop or increase democracy in Afghanistan, in human rights, especially rights for women and children. I tried to educate people. And that was my responsibility. It was a good chance for me to serve my people, my community, especially in remote areas where they had no access to anything, no education, no health services, no roads and no water.\nBut Mohammad's help for his homeland nearly cost him his only son. He was kidnapped by the Taliban and tortured for nearly a month.\nThey said they would need $400,000 to release my son, which was not possible for me. Finally, they accepted $60,000. I had to sell everything. I lost my house. I sold my car. Even after I received my son, they messaged me that you have no more rights to work with U.N. international NGOs, especially with U.S. projects. Otherwise, you will be killed or we will kill your family.\nIt's very bad memory that I have. And my wife, after many years, she's not mentally OK.\nThe family is not OK. Today, the threat they face is daily. When the Taliban took over, they released his son's torturers, who are now local commanders.\nThis is the fourth house which I changed. During the four years, when me and my son go to the bazaar, or market, we just put on masks and sunglasses to not be recognized by anyone.\nUnder Taliban rule, life for Afghans who aided America has become a living nightmare. The Taliban administer their vengeance through torture, drowning this former member of the security forces, shooting this former police chief.\nBut America's Afghan allies have nowhere to go. Soon after inauguration, President Trump suspended the Refugee Admissions Program. And in May, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem rescinded Afghans' temporary protected status, which allowed them to live in the U.S. for up to 18 months.\nShe said Afghanistan's conditions — quote — \"do not meet the requirements for a TPS designation,\" and that Afghanistan has had an improved security situation. In late July, President Trump suggested he wanted to take care of only some Afghan refugees.\nQuestion:\nWhat is America's debt to our Afghan war allies that kept our veterans safe over there? There's been some talk about sending a lot of them back. Would you let your administration do that?\nDonald Trump, President of the United States: We know the good ones, and we know the ones that maybe aren't so good. You know, some came over that aren't so good. And we're going to take care of those people, the ones that did a job.\n\"Abdul,\" Former English Teacher: We were so happy that he is the president of the United States. But he surprised everyone by what he did, the executive orders, put on suspension.\nA man we will call Abdul is a former English teacher, including of girls. He worked with the U.S. Embassy and American Council for five years before the Taliban takeover.\nHe'd been approved for a P-1 visa, designated for at-risk refugees, referred by U.S. government agencies and NGOs. He was just waiting for his medical check in flight when President Trump suspended the program.\nWe're changing your voice. We're blurring your face. What's the risk that you face today?\n“Abdul”:\nTwo options, detain or kill. If it's known that I was a person who worked with the U.S. Embassy and American Council, especially with the people of America, there is no justice. There is no court. They will just order their soldiers to check their aim and just shoot you in your head.\nI do not have a plan for now or for the future. That is the situation at this time in Afghanistan.\nAn Afghanistan under the Taliban is one of tyranny and tribulation. Dissent is met with public execution. Unemployment and inflation are high, and women have been silenced, barred from receiving an education or even participating in almost all aspects of public life. Some of their homes are now their prisons.\nI no longer know what will be the future of us, the future of my students, who still didn't even complete their education. And these thoughts hit me hard. So, by the course of time, even I feel depressed.\nWhy were we left behind? What crime did we commit? We gave all of our ability. We gave everything we had. And now we are living in limbo. We are living anonymously. We are hiding in a corner of our home.\nHiding and hopeless. Four years later, American allies and many Afghans have never felt more alone.\nFor the \"PBS News Hour,\" I'm Nick Schifrin.\nWatch the Full Episode\nNick Schifrin is PBS NewsHour’s Foreign Affairs and Defense Correspondent.

        "Taliban release U.S. citizen from prison in Afghanistan. The Taliban released another U.S. citizen from custody in Afghanistan on Sunday, as the internationally ostracized regime seeks to normalize relations with Washington.\nAmir Amiry had been held in Afghanistan since December. It is unclear why he was there and why he was detained.\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio welcomed Amiry’s release, saying it reflected the Trump administration’s determination to protect Americans from wrongful detention abroad.\n“We express our sincere gratitude to Qatar, whose strong partnership and tireless diplomatic efforts were vital to securing his release,” he said in a statement Sunday.\nThe Afghan government also expressed thanks to Qatar, the Gulf state that was also instrumental in securing the release this month of a British couple whom the Taliban had held for more than seven months.\nAmiry’s release came as the Trump administration’s hostage envoy, Adam Boehler, met in Kabul on Sunday with Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi for the second time this month.\nMuttaqi told Boehler that the United States and Afghanistan must work together to resolve issues related to peace and security, Hafiz Takal, director general of the Afghan Foreign Affairs Ministry, told NBC News.\nFour other Americans have been released from Taliban detention this year: Ryan Corbett and William McKenty in January and George Glezmann and Faye Hall in separate releases in March.\nThe U.S. government is still seeking the release of other Americans considered unjustly detained in Afghanistan, including Mahmood Habibi, who worked for an American consulting group and was arrested in August 2022. The Taliban have not confirmed whether Habibi is in custody.\n“We have faith in President Trump,” Habibi’s brother, Ahmad Habibi, said Sunday in a post on X welcoming Amiry’s release.\nTrump signed an executive order this month that would enable the United States to designate nations as state sponsors of wrongful detention, putting them at risk of sanctions. According to the nonprofit Foley Foundation, at least 54 Americans were being held hostage or wrongfully detained in 17 countries around the world last year, including Iran, China, Russia, North Korea and Venezuela.\nIt is not clear what, if anything, the United States is providing in exchange for the release of its nationals by the Taliban, who have been diplomatically isolated since they returned to power in 2021. The hard-line Islamist regime has been especially criticized for its treatment of women, and it had not been recognized by any foreign government until Russia became the first in July.\nAfghanistan, a country of more than 40 million people, has been battered by a series of economic and humanitarian crises, including a 6.0-magnitude earthquake last month that killed more than 2,000 people, and it is seeking investment in addition to diplomatic recognition.\nTrump also said this month that he wanted the United States to retake Bagram Air Base, a sprawling facility north of Afghanistan’s capital, Kabul, that for almost 20 years was a crucial hub in the war against the Taliban and Al Qaeda. He has continued to push for it even after the Taliban rejected the idea, saying “bad things” will happen unless the base is returned to U.S. control.",
        "Al Qaeda remains most dangerous terrorist group 24 years after 9/11, expert warns. In the 24-years since a group of 19 members of the al Qaeda terrorist group boarded and hijacked four flights in a series of attacks on the U.S. that killed 2,977 people, the infamous network remains the \"most dangerous terrorist group\" in the world today, warned one expert.\nThough terrorist groups like ISIS and Hamas have gained immense notoriety over the last several years due to their brutal tactics, Bill Roggio, expert analyst and senior editor of Foundation for Defense of Democracies’ \"Long War Journal,\" explained to Fox News Digital that the threat posed by al Qaeda is far more sweeping today.\n\"The most dangerous terrorist group 24 years after 9/11 remains al Qaeda,\" Roggio said. \"With the support of the Taliban, the situation there is far worse than it was pre-9/11.\"\nWEST POINT CADET TURNED ARMY VETERAN HONORS BROTHER LOST IN 9/11 ATTACKS THROUGH METS GAME TRIBUTE\nRoggio explained that not only is al Qaeda running training camps in at least 13 of the 34 provinces in Afghanistan, its global operations have only continued to expand in the last two decades across the Middle East and Africa.\n\"Its global organization remains intact. It controls probably more than a third of Somalia and then, it’s so-called former affiliate – and I'm not convinced the links have been broken – now controls the government of Syria, with the Hayat Tahir Al Sham as its leader.\n\"President [Donald] Trump, even welcomed the takeover, the ouster of Bashar Al Assad. This was a mistake, in my estimation,\" he added. \"It's a group that has proven to be clever, to be committed.\"\nRoggio explained that his chief concern when it comes to terrorism nearly two-and-half decades after 9/11 is the safe haven they have been granted, and the public’s sentiment towards the various groups.\n\"The number one concern I have for the threat of terrorism is the rise in safe havens for these groups,\" he said. \"Afghanistan – al Qaeda, running training camps, the Iranians continuing to provide safe haven, countries like Iraq, where the Shia militias are permitted to operate, al-Shabab – al Qaeda branch in Somalia – has safe haven in the areas they control.\"\nCARTEL CONNECTION: HEZBOLLAH AND IRAN EXPLOIT MADURO’S VENEZUELA FOR COCAINE CASH\n\"This is where, when terrorist groups have the time, the space and the security to plot, to execute, to recruit, to raise funds, they can conduct an attack like 9/11 and they have that in multiple places now,\" Roggio added.\nTerrorist groups have increasingly gained access to more sophisticated weaponry through state support like that provided by Iran to groups such as Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis.\nBut the ease of access to technological developments like AI and accessible technology like drones has further increased the threat level that these groups pose.\nRoggio also pointed out that the groups do not need access to top arms or technological advancements to cause real harm.\n\"Nobody thought that box cutters and some training on airlines would lead to 9/11 and yet it happened,\" he said.\nGroups that either did not exist or were a \"shadow\" of themselves prior to 9/11 and worked on a cellular level now have \"armies across the globe,\" explained Roggio.\nBut he also pointed out that open public support for groups that have carried out immense atrocities and human rights violations are also on the rise.\n\"When you look at the attitudes toward jihadist organizations, look at the support for Hamas today… the rise in antisemitism and the decrease in support for Israel – these are all indicators that things are trending for the jihadist organizations.\n\"To me, these are indications that we have lost the war on terror,\" he added.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nRoggio explained that there is a lack of \"will\" to fully address why there is a rise in extremism and how to best counter that, which cannot be done militarily alone, but by countering radical ideology.\n\"We defeated Nazi Germany,\" he pointed out. \"It's something that can be done. We had the will to do it.\n\"Our hesitation, our unwillingness, our lack of commitment in these countries has emboldened them and again,\" Roggio said. \"Until we remove the state sponsorship, until we are able to effectively deal with the purveyors of the radical ideology, these threats will persist.\"",

Taliban leader bans WIFI in an Afghan province to 'prevent immorality'\nThe Taliban leader has banned fibre optic internet in Afghanistan's Balkh province to “prevent immorality,” according to a spokesman for the administration\nJALALABAD, Afghanistan -- JALALABAD, Afghanistan (AP) — The Taliban leader banned fibre optic internet in an Afghan province to “prevent immorality,” a spokesman for the administration said Tuesday.\nIt’s the first time a ban of this kind has been imposed since the Taliban seized power in August 2021, and leaves government offices, the private sector, public institutions, and homes in northern Balkh province without Wi-Fi internet.

He gave no further information, including why Balkh was chosen for the ban or if the shutdown would spread to other provinces.\nOne Balkh resident noticed connectivity issues a few days ago at home and contacted his service provider, which said it was a technical issue that would be resolved.\n“Blocking the internet is beyond my comprehension in such an advanced era,” said the resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of Taliban reprisals.\nHe told The Associated Press that he rarely used mobile internet because it was slow and expensive. There were six people in his household, including a student, and they all used and needed Wi-Fi.\nA fast and stable internet connection was also important for his work, which involved dealing with people and companies located outside Afghanistan.\n“If this ban continues, it will not only be detrimental to my business but also to others because all our business is done on the internet,” said the resident. “We do business with people in the outside world and maintain relationships through it. I might have to move from Mazar-e-Sharif (the capital of Balkh) to another province because I cannot afford the loss.”\nAfghan authorities sometimes suspend the mobile phone network for security reasons, usually during religious festivals, to prevent detonations of explosive devices.\n—\nAssociated Press writer Abdul Qahar Afghan in Jalalabad, Afghanistan, contributed to this report.\nRelated Topics\nSponsored Content by Taboola\nPopular Reads\nABC News Live\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

Mobile internet and satellite TV has also been severely disrupted across Afghanistan.\nThe Taliban have yet to give an official reason for the shutdown. Since seizing power in 2021, the Taliban have imposed numerous restrictions in accordance with their interpretation of Islamic Sharia law.\nA Taliban official said the telecom shutdown would last until further notice.\nTolo News, a privately owned Afghan news channel, told people to follow its social media pages for updates as it expected disruptions to its television and radio networks.\nFlights from Kabul airport have also been disrupted, local media reported.\nAccording to Flight tracking service Flightradar24, at least eight flights scheduled to depart from or arrive at Kabul International Airport on Tuesday have been cancelled.\nDiplomatic officials have told the BBC that the internet cuts could affect banking and e-commerce systems nationwide.\nSeveral people in Kabul have told the BBC that their fibre-optic internet stopped working towards the end of the working day, around 17:00 local time (12:30 GMT)\nBecause of this, it is understood many people will not notice the impact until Tuesday morning, when banking services and other businesses are due to resume.\nFibre-optic cables transfer data super fast, and are used for much of the world's internet.\nIn a post on social network Mastodon.social, Netblocks said:\n\"Afghanistan is now in the midst of a total internet blackout as Taliban authorities move to implement morality measures, with multiple networks disconnected through the morning in a stepwise manner; telephone services are currently also impacted\".\nFor weeks internet users in several Afghan provinces have been complaining about either slow internet access or no connectivity.\nSeveral residents, who requested anonymity, previously told the BBC that their businesses and lives had been seriously affected by the internet cuts.\nA man who works as a money changer in Takhar province told the BBC that his daughters' online English classes were disrupted. \"Their last opportunity to study and stay engaged is now gone,\" he said.\nAnother woman previously told the BBC that she could not attend online classes since her home internet was cut off. \"I had hoped to finish my studies and find an online job, but that dream has also been destroyed,\" she said. \"Without internet access, I don't know what will happen next.\"\nHamid Haidari, former editor-in-chief of Afghan news channel 1TV, said on Monday that \"loneliness enveloped the entire country\" after the shutdown.\n\"Afghanistan has now officially taken first place in the competition with North Korea for [internet] disconnection\" he said on X.\n\"The silence online without Afghan voices from inside Afghanistan is deafening,\" Mariam Solaimankhil, a former member of Afghanistan's parliament now based in the US, wrote in a post tagging X owner Elon Musk.\nThe Taliban earlier said an alternative route for internet access would be created, without giving any details.\nThe blackout is the latest in a series of restrictions which the Taliban have enforced since returning to power.\nEarlier this month they removed books written by women from the country's university teaching system as part of a new ban which has also outlawed the teaching of human rights and sexual harassment.\nWomen and girls have also been particularly hard-hit: they are barred from accessing education beyond the age of 12, with one of their last routes to further training cut off in late 2024, when midwifery courses were quietly shut down.\nA university student told the BBC that she had \"no other choice except online study\" after her midwifery course was banned. \"When I heard that the internet had been cut, the world felt dark to me,\" she said.\nThe Taliban retook control of Afghanistan in 2021 in a lightning advance, weeks after the withdrawal of US and other international forces."

        "World's first AI minister will eliminate corruption, says Albania's PM. World's first AI minister will eliminate corruption, says Albania's PM\nFor government officials, being called \"heartless\" is an occupational hazard. But Albania has chosen to turn that insult into a positive quality, by appointing an AI minister.\nNot a minister for artificial intelligence. Rather, a cabinet member who is, literally, the work of AI.\nThe new addition is, like a pop star, known simply by the single name: Diella.\nPrime Minister Edi Rama introduced her as a member of his new cabinet on Thursday, four months after securing his fourth term in office in May elections.\nHowever, the move was symbolic rather than official, as Albania's constitution insists that government ministers must be mentally competent citizens aged at least 18.\nStill, the advantages of appointing a bot over a human are obvious.\nDiella, whose name means sun in Albanian, is unlikely to be the source of any unflattering leaks about the government. She will only be power-hungry in the sense of the electricity she consumes. And a damaging expenses scandal would appear to be out of the question.\nIn fact, corruption was uppermost in Rama's mind when he made Diella part of his team as minister for public procurement.\nHer role will be to ensure that Albania will become \"a country where public tenders are 100% free of corruption\".\n\"We're working with a brilliant team, which is not only Albanian but also international, to come out with the first full AI model in public procurement,\" the prime minister told the BBC.\n\"Not only will we wipe out every potential influence on public biddings – we will also make the process much faster, much more efficient and totally accountable.\"\nDiella had already been working in Albania even before the government \"appointment\". Her first incarnation was as an AI-powered virtual assistant, guiding applicants through the process to obtain official documents.\nRama boasts that Diella has \"helped more than a million applications\" on the e-Albania platform. But his vision for AI's government role is a lot grander than a mere chatbot.\nHe talks of \"leapfrogging\" bigger, more advanced countries, which are still locked into \"traditional ways of working\".\nReactions to Diella's new role are, understandably, mixed. The opposition Democratic Party has labelled the initiative \"ridiculous\" and \"unconstitutional\".\nBut others are cautiously optimistic.\nThe founder of financial services company Balkans Capital, Aneida Bajraktari Bicja, notes that Edi Rama \"often mixes reform with theatrics, so it's natural people wonder if this is symbolism\". But she says the \"'AI minister' could be constructive if it develops into real systems that improve transparency and trust in public procurement\".\nAnti-corruption experts have also noted the potential for AI to be deployed to minimise graft.\n\"AI is still a new tool – but if it is programmed correctly, when you put a bid in online, you can see clearly and more closely if a company meets the conditions and the criteria,\" says Dr Andi Hoxhaj of King's College London, a specialist in the Western Balkans, corruption and the rule of law.\nHe believes Albania's rapid progress in EU accession talks and encouragement from Brussels to complete the negotiations by 2027 mean that the country has a powerful incentive to tackle graft.\n\"There's a lot at stake,\" he says. \"The main precondition from the EU has been to address corruption. If [Diella] is a vehicle or mechanism that could be used towards that goal, it's worth exploring.\"\nEdi Rama does not deny that there is an element of a publicity stunt to his latest wheeze. But he insists that there is serious intent behind the playful presentation.\n\"It puts pressure on other members of the cabinet and national agencies to run and think differently. This is the biggest advantage I'm expecting from this minister,\" he says.\nIn other words, ministers beware: AI could be coming for their jobs as well.",
        "Albania's government debuts its AI ‘minister’ to parliament. Albania's government debuts its AI ‘minister’ to parliament\nPrime Minister Edi Rama has introduced an AI-generated bot which he has called a government minister in the Albanian parliament\nTIRANA, Albania -- An AI-generated government “minister” was debuted in the Albanian parliament on Thursday, with Prime Minister Edi Rama presenting the bot as a symbol of his government’s push for transparency and innovation.\n“The Constitution speaks of institutions at the people’s service.

        "Albania's leader says his new Cabinet includes an AI 'minister' to fight corruption. Albania's leader says his new Cabinet includes an AI 'minister' to fight corruption\nAlbania's Prime Minister Edi Rama says his new cabinet will include an artificial intelligence “minister” in charge of fighting corruption\nTIRANA, Albania -- Albania’s leader said Friday his new cabinet will include an artificial intelligence “minister” that will be in charge of running public funding projects and fighting corruption in public tenders.\nPrime Minister Edi Rama said Diella, whose name means “Sun” in Albanian, is a “member of the Cabinet who is not present physically but has been created virtually from artificial intelligence.”\nRama said Diella would help ensure that “public tenders will be 100% free of corruption.”\nDiella was launched earlier this year as a virtual assistant on the e-Albania public service platform, where she helps users navigate the site while wearing traditional Albanian folk costume.\nRama’s Socialist Party secured a fourth consecutive term after winning 83 of the 140 Assembly seats in the May 11 parliamentary elections. The party can govern alone and pass most legislation, but it needs a two-thirds majority, or 93 seats, to change the Constitution.\nThe Socialists have said it can deliver EU membership for Albania in five years, with negotiations concluding by 2027. The pledge has been met with skepticism by the Democrats, who contend Albania is far from prepared.\nThe conservative Democratic Party-led coalition, headed by former prime minister and President Sali Berisha, won 50 seats. The party has not accepted the official election results, claiming irregularities, but its members participated in the new parliament’s inaugural session. The remaining seats went to four smaller parties.\nLegal experts say more work may be needed to establish Diella's official status.\nCorruption has remained a top issue in the Western Balkan country since the fall of the communist regime in 1990.\nParliament began the process to swear in new lawmakers Friday. Later in the day, lawmakers are expected to elect a new speaker and deputies and formally present Rama’s new cabinet.\nRelated Topics\nSponsored Content by Taboola\nPopular Reads\nABC News Live\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

        "Comer vows 'accountability,' Trump rips 'scandal' after bombshell report on Biden autopen pardons. House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky., said his panel is wrapping up its investigation into President Joe Biden’s use of the autopen after a new report revealed concerns raised within the former administration itself.\n\"New records reveal President Biden’s own administration raised concerns about autopen use to grant thousands of pardons. This is a historic scandal with massive repercussions,\" Comer told Fox News Digital in response to the Axios report.\n\"As President Biden declined, his aides carried out executive actions without his approval, casting doubt on the legitimacy of thousands of pardons and other executive actions.\"\nComer added, \"The House Oversight Committee is in the final stages of its investigation. There must be accountability for this scandal.\"\nBIDEN’S AUTO-PEN PARDONS DISTURBED DOJ BRASS, DOCS SHOW, RAISING QUESTIONS WHETHER THEY ARE LEGALLY BINDING\nPresident Donald Trump weighed in on Truth Social: \"THE BIDEN AUTOPEN SCANDAL IS BIG, NOT AS BIG AS THE RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA HOAX, OR THE RIGGED 2020 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, BUT, NEVERTHELESS, ONE OF THE BIGGEST, EVER!!!\"\nA former Biden White House staffer familiar with the pardons process pushed back.\n\"Republicans like to talk about Biden whenever news hits that they don’t want to talk about. Today, they want to talk about Biden because Trump is responsible for the latest jobs report, which is the worst August jobs gain since 2020,\" the staffer told Fox News Digital.\n\"What these emails show is a full process to support that decision-making and checks on the use of the autopen.\"\nAxios reported over the weekend that senior Department of Justice (DOJ) officials flagged issues with Biden’s clemency process in his final days in office.\nBiden approved nearly 2,500 commutations on Jan. 17, just days before leaving the White House, setting a record for most clemency orders ever granted by a U.S. president — more than 4,200 in total — and the most ever in a single day.\nThe next day, DOJ ethics lawyer Bradley Weinsheimer reportedly wrote in a memo: \"Unfortunately and despite repeated requests and warnings, we were not afforded a reasonable opportunity to vet and provide input on those you were considering.\"\nNoting that at least one murderer granted clemency had been flagged by DOJ, he added: \"I have no idea if the president was aware of these backgrounds when making clemency decisions.\" The New York Post first reported details of the memo.\nMeanwhile, Axios reported that a DOJ pardon attorney took issue with White House lawyers asking the department not to solicit views of murder victims' families of multiple death row inmates if it had not already done so — including people whose sentences Biden commuted as well.\nThe Axios report further revealed that Biden White House staff secretary Stef Feldman repeatedly sought clarity on the autopen process. In one Jan. 16 email, she asked for details on drug-related clemency orders approved by then-Chief of Staff Jeff Zients. After being asked to use autopen on an executive order, Feldman reportedly wrote: \"When did we get [Biden's] approval of this?\"\n'SHOULD BE PROSECUTED': HOUSE REPUBLICANS ZERO IN ON BIDEN AUTOPEN PARDONS AFTER BOMBSHELL REPORT\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe former Biden staffer insisted the process was sound.\n\"The pardon power rests with the president — not the Department of Justice,\" the staffer said. \"While the DOJ is free to raise its own concerns about pardons, and did before Trump fired all of the career staff who did so, it is ultimately the President’s decision.\"\nBiden himself told The New York Times recently that he made every clemency decision on his own.\nZients is expected to testify before the Oversight Committee later this month.

        "Trump renews attacks on Biden autopen pardons, claims he ‘never gave the orders’. President Donald Trump renewed his criticism against former President Joe Biden and his administration over the use of an autopen to sign off on important orders — including pardons — during Biden’s tenure in the White House.\nTrump has railed against Biden’s use of the autopen for months, claiming thousands of pardons Biden signed were void and that the former president did not know what documents he was signing through the automated device.\n\"It was illegally used. He never gave the orders,\" Trump told reporters Thursday during a trip to the U.K. \"He never told them what to do. And I guess the only one he signed, or one of the few he signed, was the pardon for his son.\"\nTOP BIDEN OFFICIALS QUESTIONED AND CRITICIZED HOW HIS TEAM ISSUED PARDONS, USED AUTOPEN: REPORT\nA spokesperson for Biden did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.\nA White House official previously told Fox News Digital that Trump uses his hand signature for every legally operational or binding document. Even so, Trump has admitted that he uses an autopen for letters.\nMeanwhile, Biden’s chief of staff issued final approval for multiple high-profile preemptive pardons during Biden’s final days in office, the New York Times reported in July.\nAlthough Biden reportedly made the decision about the pardons in a meeting, Biden’s chief of staff Jeff Zients is the one who gave final approval for the use of the autopen — at least in the case of former chief medical advisor to the president, Anthony Fauci, and former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley, the Times reported.\n'SHOULD BE PROSECUTED': HOUSE REPUBLICANS ZERO IN ON BIDEN AUTOPEN PARDONS AFTER BOMBSHELL REPORT\nEven so, Biden told the Times that he made every clemency decision of his own accord.\nMeanwhile, Trump’s comments come as Zients is slated to appear before the House Oversight Committee Thursday for its probe into Biden’s mental acuity. Part of that investigation is also examining if the former president was fully cognizant of clemency orders and executive actions he signed using the autopen.\nBiden granted a total of 4,245 acts of clemency during his administration, 96% of which were granted during his final months in office between October 2024 and January 2025, according to the Pew Research Center.\nBIDEN CHIEF OF STAFF REPORTEDLY GAVE APPROVAL FOR AUTOPEN PARDONS ON FINAL DAY IN OFFICE\nAn autopen is a machine that physically holds a pen and follows programming to imitate a person’s signature.\nUnlike a stamp or a digitized print of a signature, the autopen has the capability to hold various types of pens, from a ballpoint to a permanent marker, according to descriptions of autopen machines for sale online.\nFox News’ Liz Elkind contributed to this report.",
        "Biden's ex-chief of staff arrives for House Oversight grilling as mental acuity probe nears end. Former White House chief of staff Jeff Zients is on Capitol Hill Thursday as the House Oversight Committee's probe into former President Joe Biden's mental acuity draws to a close.\nHe said nothing to reporters on his way into his closed-door voluntary interview, though the ex-Biden aide did shake hands with House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., on his way into the room.\nThe sit-down is expected to last from about 10 a.m. into the afternoon.\nZients is the last former Biden official expected to be interviewed by the committee, which is also looking into whether the then-president was fully aware of clemency orders and other executive actions signed by autopen during the latter half of his term.\nRON KLAIN DODGES REPORTERS AFTER MARATHON GRILLING IN BIDEN COVER-UP PROBE\nComer told reporters ahead of the interview that Zients is \"one of the most, if not the most important, witnesses in our investigation.\"\n\"Zients was the one who authorized the use of the autopen, especially down the stretch in the last lame duck period of the Biden administration,\" Comer said. \"We've had a lot of witnesses come in that were supposedly in Biden's inner circle that were shielded from President Biden, especially in the last six months of his administration. So we believe Zients is the guy that was potentially making a lot of decisions down the stretch.\"\nZients' recollection will be of particular interest to House investigators, given his senior role in the Biden White House for most of those final two years in office.\nBefore that, he served as counselor to the president and White House COVID-19 response coordinator from Biden's swearing-in in January 2021 until April 2022.\nPerhaps most critical to the committee is Zients' reported key role in the chain of command for Biden's autopen pardons.\nLONGTIME BIDEN AIDE SAYS HE STOOD TO EARN UP TO $8M HAD PRESIDENT WON RE-ELECTION\nIt's not uncommon for presidents to use an autopen to sign documents, and it has been used by leaders on both sides of the aisle.\nHowever, Comer is questioning whether Biden was really handing down those decisions, given public concerns about his mental and physical acuity that arose toward the end of his term.\nThe New York Times reported that Zients would have been among the top aides relaying Biden's clemency decisions to assistants, who then drafted those orders before they were circulated back to Biden's senior officials and then later given final approval.\nIn that same report, Biden said he made every clemency decision on his own.\nAxios reported earlier this month that Zients signed off on pardons granted to five of Biden's family members less than 24 hours before he left office.\nThe former president's allies have pushed back on the Republican-led House Oversight probe, however, denouncing the investigation as politically motivated.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"You managed a White House in disarray after public reporting began to focus on the apparent decline of President Biden’s mental capabilities.

        "EPA Has Terminated Over $15 Million in Funding for “Forever Chemicals” Research. Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today!\nOne summer day in 2017, a front-page story in the StarNews of Wilmington, North Carolina, shook up the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. The drinking water system, it said, was polluted with a contaminant commonly known as GenX, part of the family of “forever” PFAS chemicals.\nIt came from a Chemours plant in Fayetteville, near the winding Cape Fear River. Few knew about the contaminated water until the article described the discoveries of scientists from the Environmental Protection Agency and a state university. Given that certain types of PFAS have been linked to cancer, there was widespread anxiety over its potential danger.\nIn the onslaught of legal action and activism that followed, the EPA during President Donald Trump’s first term took an assertive stance, vowing to combat the spread of PFAS nationwide.\nDon’t miss a beat\nGet the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.\nIn its big-picture PFAS action plan from 2019, the agency said it would attack this complex problem on multiple fronts. It would, for example, consider limiting the presence of two of the best-known compounds — PFOA and PFOS — in drinking water. And, it said, it would find out more about the potential harm of GenX, which was virtually unregulated.\nBy the time Trump was sworn in for his second term, many of the plan’s suggestions had been put in place. After his first administration said PFOA and PFOS in drinking water should be regulated, standards were finalized under President Joe Biden. Four other types of PFAS, including GenX, were also tagged with limits.\nBut now, the second Trump administration is pulling back. The EPA said in May that it will delay enforcement on the drinking water limits for PFOA and PFOS until 2031, and it will rescind and reconsider the limits on the other four. Among those who challenged the standards in court is Chemours, which has argued that the EPA, under Biden, “used flawed science and didn’t follow proper rulemaking procedures” for GenX.\nThese EPA decisions under Trump are part of a slew of delays and course changes to PFAS policies that had been supported in his first term. Even though his earlier EPA pursued a measure that would help hold polluters accountable for cleaning up PFAS, the EPA of his second term has not yet committed to it. The agency also slowed down a process for finding out how industries have used the chemicals, a step prompted by a law signed by Trump in 2019.\nAt the same time, the EPA is hampering its ability to research pollutants — the kind of research that made it possible for its own scientists to investigate GenX. As the Trump administration seeks severe reductions in the EPA’s budget, the agency has terminated grants for PFAS studies and paralyzed its scientists with spending restrictions.\nPointing to earlier announcements on its approach to the chemicals, the EPA told ProPublica that it’s “committed to addressing PFAS in drinking water and ensuring that regulations issued under the Safe Drinking Water Act follow the law, follow the science, and can be implemented by water systems to strengthen public health protections.”\n“If anything,” the agency added, “the Trump administration’s historic PFAS plan in 2019 laid the groundwork for the first steps to comprehensively address this contamination across media and we will continue to do so this term.”\nIn public appearances, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has pushed back on the suggestion that his agency weakened the drinking water limits on GenX and similar compounds. Future regulations imposed by his agency, he said, could be more or less stringent.\n“What we want to do is follow the science, period,” he has said.\nThat sentiment perplexes scientists and environmental advocates, who say there is already persuasive evidence on the dangers of these chemicals that linger in the environment. The EPA reviewed GenX, for example, during both the first Trump and Biden administrations. In both 2018 and 2021, the agency pointed to animal studies linking it to cancer, as well as problems with kidneys, immune systems and, especially, livers. (Chemours has argued that certain animal studies have limited relevance to humans.)\nScientists and advocates also said it’s unclear what it means for the EPA to follow the science while diminishing its own ability to conduct research.\n“I don’t understand why we would want to hamstring the agency that is designed to make sure we have clean air and clean water,” said Jamie DeWitt, a toxicologist in Oregon who worked with other scientists on Cape Fear River research. “I don’t understand it.”\nDelays, Confusion Over PFAS\nFavored for their nonstick and liquid-resistant qualities, synthetic PFAS chemicals are widely used in products like raincoats, cookware and fast food wrappers. Manufacturers made the chemicals for decades without disclosing how certain types are toxic at extremely low levels, can accumulate in the body and will scarcely break down over time — hence the nickname “forever chemicals.”\nThe chemicals persist in soil and water too, making them complicated and costly to clean up, leading to a yearslong push to get such sites covered by the EPA’s Superfund program, which is designed to handle toxic swaths of land. During the first Trump administration, the EPA said it was taking steps toward designating the two legacy compounds, PFOA and PFOS, as “hazardous substances” under the Superfund program. Its liability provisions would help hold polluters responsible for the cost of cleaning up.\nMoving forward with this designation process was a priority, according to the PFAS plan from Trump’s first term. Zeldin’s EPA describes that plan as “historic.” And, when he represented a Long Island district with PFAS problems in Congress, Zeldin voted for a bill that would have directed the EPA to take this step.\nThe designation became official under Biden. But business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and organizations representing the construction, recycling and chemical industries, sued. Project 2025, The Heritage Foundation’s playbook for the new administration, also questioned it.\nZeldin has said repeatedly that he wants to hold polluters accountable for PFAS, but his EPA requested three delays in the court case challenging the Superfund designation that helps make it possible.\nThe agency said in a recent motion it needed the latest pause because new leadership is still reviewing the issues and evaluating the designation in context of its “comprehensive strategy to address PFOA and PFOS.”\nThe EPA also delayed a rule requiring manufacturers and importers to report details about their PFAS use between 2011 and 2022. An annual bill that sets defense policy and spending, signed by Trump in his first term, had charged the EPA with developing such a process.\nWhen Biden’s EPA finalized it, the agency said the rule would provide the largest-ever dataset of PFAS manufactured and used in the United States. It would help authorities understand their spread and determine what protections might be warranted.\nBusinesses were supposed to start reporting this month. But in a May 2 letter, a coalition of chemical companies petitioned the EPA to withdraw the deadline, reconsider the rule and issue a revised one with narrowed scope.\nWhen the EPA delayed the rule less than two weeks later, it said it needed time to prepare for data collection and to consider changes to aspects of the rule.\nIn an email to ProPublica, the agency said it will address PFAS in many ways. Its approach, the agency said, is to give more time for compliance and to work with water systems to reduce PFAS exposure as quickly as feasible, “rather than issue violations and collect fees that don’t benefit public health.”\nThe court expects an update from the EPA in the Superfund designation case by Wednesday, and in the legal challenges to the drinking water standards by July 21. The EPA could continue defending the rules. It could ask the court for permission to reverse its position or to send the rules back to the agency for reconsideration. Or it could also ask for further pauses.\n“It’s just a big unanswered question whether this administration and this EPA is going to be serious about enforcing anything,” said Robert Sussman, a former EPA official from the administrations of Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. As a lawyer, he now represents environmental groups that filed an amicus brief in PFAS cases.\nBack in North Carolina, problems caused by the chemicals continue to play out.\nA consent order between the state and Chemours required the manufacturer to drastically reduce the release of GenX and other PFAS into the environment. (The chemicals commonly called GenX refer to HFPO-DA and its ammonium salt, which are involved in the GenX processing aid technology owned by Chemours.)\nChemours told ProPublica that it invested more than $400 million to remediate and reduce PFAS emissions. It also noted that there are hundreds of PFAS users in North Carolina, “as evidenced by PFAS seen upstream and hundreds of miles away” from its Fayetteville plant “that cannot be traced back to the site.”\nPFAS-riddled sea foam continues to wash up on the coastal beaches. Chemours and water utilities, meanwhile, are battling in court about who should cover the cost of upgrades to remove the chemicals from drinking water.\nCommunity forums about PFAS draw triple-digit crowds, even when they’re held on a weeknight, said Emily Donovan, co-founder of the volunteer group Clean Cape Fear, which has intervened in federal litigation. In the fast-growing region, new residents are just learning about the chemicals, she said, and they’re angry.\n“I feel like we’re walking backwards,” Donovan said. Pulling back from the drinking water standards, in particular, is “disrespectful to this community.”\n“It’s one thing to say you’re going to focus on PFAS,” she added. “It’s another thing to never let it cross the finish line and become any meaningful regulation.”\nResearch Under Fire\nThe EPA of Trump’s first term didn’t just call for more regulation of PFAS, it also stressed the importance of better understanding the forever chemicals through research and testing.\nIn a 2020 update to its PFAS action plan, the EPA highlighted its support for North Carolina’s investigation of GenX in the Cape Fear River. And it described its efforts to develop the science on PFAS issues affecting rural economies with “first-of-its-kind funding for the agriculture sector.”\nZeldin, too, has boasted about advancing PFAS research in an April news release. “This is just a start of the work we will do on PFAS to ensure Americans have the cleanest air, land, and water,” he said.\nAt about the same time, though, the agency terminated a host of congressionally appropriated grants for PFAS research, including over $15 million for projects focused on food and farmlands in places like Utah, Texas and Illinois.\nScientists at Michigan State University, for example, were investigating how PFAS interacts with water, soil, crops, livestock and biosolids, which are used for fertilizer. They timed their latest study to this year’s growing season, hired staff and partnered with a farm. Then the EPA canceled two grants.\nIn virtually identical letters, the agency said that each grant “no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities. The objectives of the award are no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities.”\nThe contrast between the agency’s words and actions raises questions about the process behind its decisions, said Cheryl Murphy, head of Michigan State’s Center for PFAS Research and co-lead of one of the projects.\n“If you halt it right now,” she said, “what we’re doing is we’re undermining our ability to translate the science that we’re developing into some policy and guidance to help people minimize their exposure to PFAS.”\nAt least some of the researchers are appealing the terminations.\nAbout a month after PFAS grants to research teams in Maine and Virginia were terminated for not being aligned with agency priorities, the agency reinstated them. The EPA told ProPublica that “there will be more updates on research-related grants in the future.”\nEven if the Michigan State grants are reinstated, there could be lasting consequences, said Hui Li, the soil scientist who led both projects. “We will miss the season for this year,” he said in an email, “and could lose the livestock on the farm for the research.”\nFederal researchers are also in limbo. Uncertainty, lost capacity and spending restrictions have stunted the work at an EPA lab in Duluth, Minnesota, that investigates PFAS and other potential hazards, according to several sources connected to it. As one source who works at the lab put it, “We don’t know how much longer we will be operating as is.”\nThe EPA told ProPublica that it’s “continuing to invest in research and labs, including Duluth, to advance the mission of protecting human health and the environment.”\nMeanwhile, the agency is asking Congress to eliminate more than half of its own budget. That includes massive staffing cuts, and it would slash nearly all the money for two major programs that help states fund water and wastewater infrastructure. One dates back to President Ronald Reagan’s administration. The other was spotlighted in a paper by Trump’s first-term EPA, which said communities could use these funds to protect public health from PFAS. It trumpeted examples from places like Michigan and New Jersey.\nThe EPA lost 727 employees in voluntary separations between Jan. 1 and late June, according to numbers the agency provided to ProPublica. It said it received more than 2,600 applications for the second round of deferred resignations and voluntary early retirements.\n“These are really technical, difficult jobs,” said Melanie Benesh, vice president for government affairs at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group. “And the EPA, by encouraging so many employees to leave, is also losing a lot of institutional knowledge and a lot of technical expertise.”\nThe shake-up also worries DeWitt, who was one of the scientists who helped investigate the Cape Fear River contamination and who has served on an EPA science advisory board. Her voice shook as she reflected on the EPA’s workforce, “some of the finest scientists I know,” and what their loss means for public well-being.\n“Taking away this talent from our federal sector,” she said, will have “profound effects on the agency’s ability to protect people in the United States from hazardous chemicals in air, in water, in soil and potentially in food.”\nMedia that fights fascism\nTruthout is funded almost entirely by readers — that’s why we can speak truth to power and cut against the mainstream narrative.

        "Exposure to some common Pfas changes gene activity, new study finds. New research suggests exposure to some common Pfas or “forever chemical” compounds causes changes to gene activity, and those changes are linked to health problems including multiple cancers, neurological disorders and autoimmune disease.\nThe findings are a major step toward determining the mechanism by which the chemicals cause disease and could help doctors identify, detect and treat health problems for those exposed to Pfas before the issues advance. The research may also point toward other diseases potentially caused by Pfas that have not yet been identified, the authors said.\nThe study is among the first to examine how Pfas chemicals impact gene activity, called epigenetics.\n“This gives us a hint as to which genes and which Pfas might be important,” said Melissa Furlong, a University of Arizona College of Public Health Pfas researcher and study lead author.\nPfas are a class of about 15,000 compounds most frequently used to make products water-, stain- and grease-resistant. They have been linked to cancer, birth defects, decreased immunity, high cholesterol, kidney disease and a range of other serious health problems. They are dubbed “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down in the environment\nThe study checked the blood of about 300 firefighters from four departments across the country who were exposed to high levels of Pfas. The chemicals are the main ingredient in most firefighting foam, and are frequently used in “turnout gear” worn by firefighters because of their heat repelling properties\nFurlong said she was surprised to find the number of genes and biological pathways that were impacted by Pfas, which suggests the chemicals may cause or contribute to a broad range of health problems. The study did not prove the chemicals cause certain diseases, but findings point to biological changes that might precede disease.\nGenes play a range of roles in developing or preventing disease, and Pfas essentially change the way the genes are supposed to act, Furlong said. A gene may act as tumor suppressor, but the Pfas interferes with how it expresses, which affects whether cancer develops, or the type of cancer.\nFor example, PFOS, among the most common and dangerous Pfas compounds, reduces levels of miR-128-1-5p, a gene tied to cancer development. Branched forms of PFOS were linked to changes in five other genes, including some that regulate cancer development.\nDifferent Pfas and chemical structures were found to affect different genes, and were associated with different health outcomes. Not all compounds impacted gene expressions.\nThe research found connections among Pfas-related gene changes and biological pathways involved in leukemia, as well as bladder, liver, thyroid and breast cancers. Other genes and biological pathways were involved in Alzheimer’s disease, and autoimmune and infectious diseases such as lupus, asthma and tuberculosis.\nFurlong said it remains unclear at which step in the biological processes disease is triggered, but the picture is clear enough to point to possible treatments. Pharmaceutical companies are trying to develop drugs that could alter gene activity and potentially prevent Pfas-linked disease from developing.",
        "New Jersey Wins Historic $2 Billion Settlement From Chemical Companies Over PFAS. In a major victory for environmental advocates, chemical giant DuPont and its related companies have agreed to pay $2 billion to clean up four industrial sites in New Jersey that are contaminated with “forever chemicals,” or PFAS, which have been found to persist in everything from rainwater to human breast milk. It is the third such settlement New Jersey has reached in less than three years, and marks a growing movement against the widespread use of PFAS, a class of chemicals still used to produce countless industrial and consumer goods, even though they have been linked to cancer and birth defects for over half a century. For more, we’re joined by investigative journalist Mariah Blake, the author of a new book on PFAS and the fight against them, to discuss the history of the pervasive toxins and the dangers they pose to human health.\nTRANSCRIPT\nThis is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.\nAMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. I’m Amy Goodman.\nUncompromised, uncompromising news\nGet reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day.\nOfficials in New Jersey have won what they say is the largest environmental settlement ever achieved by a single state, when chemical giant DuPont and its affiliates agreed to pay $2 billion to clean up four industrial sites contaminated with forever chemicals, or PFAS, which are widely used in industrial and consumer products, even though they’re linked to cancer and birth defects. It’s the third PFAS-related settlement New Jersey has reached in less than three years.\nThis is Maya van Rossum of the Delaware Riverkeeper Network, which is part of the litigation.\nMAYA VAN ROSSUM: We have PFAS contamination of the fish that live in the Delaware River. It’s so insidious. And, of course, PFAS, PFOA, various members of this man-made family of chemicals, is literally in the bodies of people in New Jersey and nationwide, having devastating health consequences. … I think that this case really is going to send a message loud and clear that’s going to reverberate across the nation.\nAMY GOODMAN: Studies show how PFAS contamination is now so ubiquitous that forever chemicals have been found in rainwater and the blood of almost all humans. This comes as the Trump administration has shuttered the Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Research and Development, which helped test for PFAS.\nAnd we’re going to talk about just what PFAS are with our next guest, Mariah Blake, investigative journalist and author of the new book, They Poisoned the World: Life and Death in the Age of Forever Chemicals. It’s on Ralph Nader’s list of books to read this summer. Her guest essay for The New York Times is headlined “This Is How to Win an Environmental Fight: Meet the Unlikely Warriors on the Front Lines of a Major Environmental Battle.” In her book, Mariah Blake reveals how the U.S. government’s top-secret Manhattan Project, that developed the atomic bomb that was dropped 80 years ago this week on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, was also responsible for the development of PFAS.\nA lot to go through here. Mariah, welcome back to Democracy Now! First, start off by telling us what PFAS — P-F-A-S — are, and then talk about the victory in New Jersey. And then we’ll talk about this historic week, 80th anniversary of the dropping of the bombs on Japan, and how that links to PFAS. Start with what they are.\nMARIAH BLAKE: OK. So, PFAS, also known as forever chemicals, are a large family of substances that have some pretty remarkable properties. They’re extremely resistant to heat, stains, water, grease, electrical currents. They stand up to chemicals that are so corrosive they burn through most other materials. And this has made them extremely useful. So, they helped usher in the aerospace travel and high-speed computing. They’ve transformed thousands of everyday items, from cookware to dental floss to kitty litter.\nOn the other hand, they are probably the most insidious pollutants in all of human history. So, we are talking about a class of chemicals that do not break down in the environment; in fact, they persist for hundreds, thousands or even millions of years. Those that have been studied are highly toxic even in the most minuscule doses. And they are literally polluting the entire planet, including human blood and ecosystems in the remotest parts of the world. And I think —\nAMY GOODMAN: And, Mariah, I just want to say that PFAS actually stands for “per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances.” That’s the P-F-A-S. Keep going.\nMARIAH BLAKE: That is correct. That is correct. So, yeah, I think the clearest example of their ubiquity comes from the study you mentioned of rainwater around the world. So, a group of prominent European scientists in 2022 looked at the levels of just the two best-studied PFAS in rainwater around the world, and they found everywhere in the world, including the remotest regions, places like the Tibetan Plateau, the levels were high enough to endanger human health and the environment. So, the levels were higher than the EPA’s safety standards for those chemicals in drinking water. The same is true of breast milk in many countries. So, not only are these chemicals ubiquitous, they’re ubiquitous at levels that — you know, that are potentially harmful to our health.\nAMY GOODMAN: Explain what happened this week in New Jersey.\nMARIAH BLAKE: So, this week, New Jersey, which is really — New Jersey is where PFAS were initially invented and mass produced. New Jersey settled with DuPont and other companies for $2 billion. This is in response to PFAS contamination. So, the companies have agreed to pay $2 billion in compensation, and there’s also a cleanup fund. And this is, as I understand it, the largest settlement paid to any state in the history of litigation.\nAMY GOODMAN: And so, let’s go back in time. You know, just a few days ago, August 6th, you had the bells ring out, as they do every year, in Hiroshima, as they remember what happened. This year, it’s 80 years ago, August 6th, 1945. On Saturday, that’s the 80th anniversary of the dropping of the atomic bomb. The U.S. dropped the atomic bomb on Nagasaki. Talk about what PFAS, what these forever chemicals, have to do with the secret Manhattan Project that developed the atomic bomb.\nMARIAH BLAKE: So, this is one of the things I found most surprising in my reporting. This class of chemicals, that are now ubiquitous in the environment and consumer goods, was actually developed by the U.S. government as part of the Manhattan Project. And the reason the government needed them is for uranium enrichment. So, uranium enrichment involved a highly corrosive chemical called uranium hexafluoride, and almost nothing could contain it, and so they needed substances that could stand up to this chemical. And they determined that the only ones that could were ones that combined carbon and fluorine, which together form the strongest bond in chemistry. And that is what PFAS are. So, they developed them during the Manhattan Project, and they were put into mass production during the Manhattan Project at a factory in New Jersey, a DuPont factory, in fact.\nAnd it was clear from the beginning that these were dangerous chemicals. So, the plants where they were produced commonly had fires and explosions. Workers who worked in these plants were constantly being hospitalized with breathing problems and chemical burns. And in fact, Manhattan Project inspectors warned their supervisors that the fear of injury was causing unrest at these plants and that people in other parts of the DuPont facility had come to fear an assignment to this, to the fluorocarbon or PFAS production, as an exile to devil’s island.\nBut it wasn’t just workers who were affected. So, around 1943, farmers downwind of this plant in New Jersey began to complain that their peach crops were burning up, that their cows were so crippled, they couldn’t stand. They had to graze by crawling on their bellies. And in some cases, farmers were also falling ill after eating the produce that they picked.\nNow, the farmers’ complaints really alarmed Manhattan Project officials. They worried that the farmers would sue and that it would compromise the secrecy of the Manhattan Project, but also that it would open the government and its contractors up to liability. So, in 1943, they launched the secret medical research program that researched the health effects of various Manhattan Project special materials, including uranium and plutonium. In fact, as part of this program, Manhattan Project scientists injected unknowing cancer patients with plutonium. But they also researched the health and environmental effects of PFAS.\nAnd Manhattan Project scientists had determined, as early as 1947, that these chemicals were highly toxic and that they were accumulating in human blood. So, one of the things that makes these chemicals so harmful is that they build up in human blood, and they stay there for a long time. Now, this program continued after the war under the auspices of the Atomic Energy Commission, and by 1970, scientists within this program had determined that PFAS were accumulating in the blood of people all over this country.\nAMY GOODMAN: So, if you can talk about — because, I mean, this book exposes so much. The title of your book is They Poisoned the World: Life and Death in the Age of Forever Chemicals. Can you talk about who “they” are? Talk about the role of the U.S. government and also the corporate cover-up of known dangers. One of your points is that you show how DuPont established the principle, “All new chemicals are safe until proven otherwise.” Mariah?\nMARIAH BLAKE: So, after the war, a company called 3M acquired a license for technology to produce PFAS, and it hired Manhattan Project chemists to develop them for use in commercial production and, you know, for manufacturing purposes and also for use in consumer goods. So, one of the first PFAS-based products was Scotchgard, the fabric protector, which is ubiquitous. Yeah, so, and then DuPont also began producing them.\nAnd these two companies also began studying the health effects very early on. So, as early as 1960, they knew these chemicals were toxic. As early as 1970, they knew they were accumulating in the blood of people all over the United States. They subsequently examined thousands of blood samples from people all over the world, including remote rural China. The only samples they could find that didn’t contain these chemicals were collected from Korean War vets before 1952. So, decades ago, these companies knew that these chemicals were ubiquitous in human blood.\nNow, the findings about their presence in human blood alarmed insiders in DuPont and 3M, and they began intensively studying the health effects of these chemicals. They quickly discovered — well, A, they discovered that they didn’t break down in the environment, and that is one of the things that makes these chemicals uniquely harmful. But they also discovered that they had a devastating effect on lab animals. So, in one case, 3M tested these chemicals on monkeys, which were chosen because they’re more biologically similar to humans than lab rats. The study had to be aborted because all of the monkeys died.\nWhen they started examining the effects on their workers, they found, you know, similarly alarming findings. So, as early as the 1970s and ’80s, they were linking these chemicals to leukemia, kidney cancer, immune suppression, organ damage, dramatic drops in testosterone. Even more alarming, they had begun to connect these chemicals to birth defects. So, in the 1970s, 3M conducted a study that found that a certain PFAS caused birth defects in the eyes of rats who were exposed in utero. And DuPont decided that it would start to monitor the pregnancies of workers in its Teflon factories — Teflon is made with PFAS — to see if their children also developed birth defects. And in fact, two of seven women who gave birth during the course of the program gave birth to children with facial deformities very similar to those found in rats.\nBut rather than inform workers or regulators or the public, DuPont simply canceled the study and continued exposing workers to these chemicals and continued releasing these chemicals into the environment, even though there were very simple steps the company could have taken to filter them out of, you know, the air and wastewater that was coming out of their plants.\nAMY GOODMAN: Finally, you wrote a piece in The New York Times, “This Is How to Win an Environmental Fight: Meet the Unlikely Warriors on the Front Lines of a Major Environmental Battle.” In this last minute we have left, who are these warriors?\nMARIAH BLAKE: So, there’s an unlikely network of activists all over this country — farmers, factory workers, suburban moms — whose lives have been personally affected by PFAS contamination, and they have been aggressively lobbying for action, and they have been remarkably effective. So, largely as a result of their activism, hundreds of laws restricting these chemicals have either passed state legislatures or are pending in state legislatures. And many of these laws, not only — they ban the entire class of chemicals in consumer products. So, this is revolutionary, because, traditionally, the way we regulate chemicals in this country is one by one, but these state-level laws are banning the entire class of chemicals. We also have a tsunami of litigation, driven largely by individuals.\nAnd the combination of these two factors, the state level legislation — there’s a ban in the works in the EU, as well — and this huge volume of litigation against PFAS manufacturers, is prompting large swaths of the economy to voluntarily move away from PFAS. So, 3M, the world’s largest manufacturer of these chemicals, has announced that it will quit producing them by the end of this year. And dozens of major retail chains, like Apple, McDonald’s, Amazon, Target, have done the same. So, they have announced that they will reduce or eliminate PFAS in their products and packaging. So, there is a hopeful dimension to the story.\nAMY GOODMAN: Mariah Blake, we want to thank you so much for being with us and —\nMARIAH BLAKE: Thank you.\nAMY GOODMAN: — for writing this book.

        "Trump threatens 35% tariffs on Canadian goods. Trump threatens 35% tariffs on Canadian goods\nUS President Donald Trump has said he will impose a 35% tariff on Canadian goods starting on 1 August, even as the two countries were days away from a self-imposed deadline to reach a new trade deal.\nThe announcement came in the form of a letter published on Trump's social media platform Truth Social, along with additional threats of blanket tariffs of 15% or 20% on most trade partners.\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said his government would continue to protect his country's workers and businesses as they head towards the new deadline.\nTrump has sent more than 20 such letters to other US partners this week. He also says he will soon announce new tariffs on the European Union.\nLike Canada's letter, Trump has vowed to implement those tariffs by 1 August.\nA blanket 25% tariff has already been imposed on some Canadian goods, with the nation also hit hard by Trump's global steel, aluminium and auto tariffs - though there is a current exemption in place for goods that comply with a North American free trade agreement.\nIt is unclear if the latest tariffs threat would also apply to goods covered by the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA).\nTrump has also imposed a global 50% tariff on aluminium and steel imports, and a 25% tariff on all cars and trucks not built in the US.\nHe also recently announced a 50% tariff on copper imports, scheduled to take effect next month.\nCanada sells about three-quarters of its goods to the US, and is an auto manufacturing hub and a major supplier of metals, making the US tariffs especially damaging to those sectors.\nAsia is reeling from Trump's tariff salvo – is anyone winning?\n-\n'In business, indecision is killer' - Canadian firms seek certainty in tariff war\n-\nTrump's letter said the 35% tariffs were separate to those sector-specific levies.\n\"As you are aware, there will be no tariff if Canada, or companies within your country, decide to build or manufacture products within the United States,\" Trump stated.\nHe also tied the tariffs to what he called \"Canada's failure\" to stop the flow of fentanyl into the US, as well as Canada's existing levies on US dairy farmers and the trade deficit between the two countries.\n\"If Canada works with me to stop the flow of Fentanyl, we will, perhaps, consider an adjustment to this letter. These Tariffs may be modified, upward or downward, depending on our relationship with Your Country,\" Trump said.\nPresident Trump has previously accused Canada - alongside Mexico - of allowing \"vast numbers of people to come in and fentanyl to come in\" to the US.\nIn his response on X, Carney said Canada had made essential progress to \"stop the scourge of fentanyl\" in North America, and that his government was committed to continuing to work alongside the US to protect communities in both countries.\nAccording to data from the US Customs and Border Patrol, only about 0.2% of all seizures of fentanyl entering the US are made at the Canadian border. Almost all of the rest is confiscated at the US border with Mexico.\nEarlier this year, Canada also announced more funding towards border security and had appointed a fentanyl czar in response to Trump's complaints.\nCanada has been engaged in intense talks with the US in recent months to reach a new trade and security deal.\nAt the G7 Summit in June, Carney and Trump said they were committed to reaching a new deal within 30 days, setting a deadline of 21 July.\nTrump threatened in the letter to increase levies on Canada if it retaliated. Canada has already imposed counter-tariffs on the US, and has vowed more if they failed to reach a deal by the deadline.\nIn late June, Carney removed a tax on big US technology firms after Trump labelled it a \"blatant attack\" and threatened to call off trade talks.\nCarney said the tax was dropped as \"part of a bigger negotiation\" on trade between the two countries.",
        "Trump's latest tariff target: Canadian goods will be hit with 35% tax in August. WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said in a letter that he will raise taxes on many imported goods from Canada to 35%, deepening a rift between two North American countries that have suffered a debilitating blow to their decades-old alliance.\nThe Thursday letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is an aggressive increase to the top 25% tariff rates that Trump first imposed in March after months of threats. Trump's tariffs were allegedly in an effort to get Canada to crack down on fentanyl smuggling despite the relatively modest trafficking in the drug from that country. Trump has also expressed frustration with a trade deficit with Canada that largely reflects oil purchases by America.\n“I must mention that the flow of Fentanyl is hardly the only challenge we have with Canada, which has many Tariff, and Non-Tariff, Policies and Trade Barriers,” Trump wrote in the letter.\nThe higher rates would go into effect Aug. 1, creating a tense series of weeks ahead for the global economy as recent gains in the S&P 500 stock index suggest many investors think Trump will ultimately back down on the increases. But stock market futures were down early Friday in a sign that Trump's wave of tariff letters may be starting to generate concern among investors.\nIn a social media post, Carney said Canada would continue to work toward a new trade framework with the U.S. and has made “vital progress to stop the scourge of fentanyl.”\n“Through the current trade negotiations with the United States, the Canadian government has steadfastly defended our workers and business,” Carney said.\nWhile multiple countries have received tariff letters this week, Canada — America's second largest trading partner after Mexico — has become something of a foil to Trump. It has imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods and pushed back on the president's taunts of making Canada the 51st state. Mexico has also faced 25% tariffs because of fentanyl, yet it has not faced the same public pressure from the Republican U.S. president.\nCarney was elected prime minister in April on the argument that Canadians should keep their “elbows up.” He has responded by distancing Canada from its intertwined relationship with the U.S., seeking to strengthen its links with the European Union and the United Kingdom.\nHours before Trump's letter, Carney posted on X a picture of himself with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, saying, “In the face of global trade challenges, the world is turning to reliable economic partners like Canada.” Implied in his statement was that the U.S. has become unreliable because of Trump's haphazard tariff regime, which has gone through aggressive threats and reversals.\nWhen Carney went to the White House in May, the public portion of their meeting was cordial. But Trump said there was nothing the Canadian leader could tell him to remove the tariffs, saying, “Just the way it is.”\nDaniel Beland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, said Trump's latest move will make it more difficult for Canada and the U.S. to reach a trade deal, Beland said.\n“It doesn’t mean a new trade deal between Canada and the United States is impossible, but it shows how hard it is for the Canadian government to negotiate with a U.S. president who regularly utters threats and doesn’t appear to be a reliable and truthful interlocutor,” he said.\nTrump has sent a series of tariff letters to 23 countries. Those form letters became increasingly personal with Canada as well as a Wednesday note that put a 50% tariff on Brazil for the ongoing trial of its former President Jair Bolsonaro for trying to stay in office after his 2022 election loss. Trump was similarly indicted for his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden.\nTrump administration officials have said that Trump was seeking to isolate its geopolitical rival China with the tariffs, but the latest tariffs have undermined that message. Brazil's largest trading partner is China, not the U.S., and Chinese government officials have framed his import taxes as a form of bullying.\n“Sovereign equality and non-interference in internal affairs are important principles of the U.N. Charter and basic norms governing international relations,\" said Mao Ning, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman. “Tariffs should not be used as a tool for coercion, bullying and interference in the internal affairs of other countries.”\nThe letters reflect the inability of Trump to finalize the dozens of trade frameworks that he claimed would be easy to negotiate. Shortly after unveiling his April 2 “Liberation Day” tariffs, a financial market selloff caused Trump to announce a 90-day negotiating period during which a 10% baseline tariff would be charged on most imported goods.\nBut Trump has indicated that the 10% tariff rates are largely disappearing as he resets the rates with his letters.\n“We’re just going to say all of the remaining countries are going to pay, whether it’s 20% or 15%,” Trump said in a phone interview with NBC News.\nTrump has announced trade frameworks with the U.K. and Vietnam, as well as a separate deal with China to enable continued trade talks. Trump jacked up import taxes on Chinese goods to as much as 145%, but after talks he has said China faces total tariffs of 55%.\nIn June, Trump said he was suspending trade talks with Canada over its plans to continue its digital services tax, which would hit U.S. technology companies. A few days later, talks resumed when Carney rescinded the tax.\nUnder the current tariff structure, the 2020 United States Mexico Canada Agreement has protected eligible goods from Trump's tariffs.

        "Sri Lanka - Public Finance Review : Towards a Balanced Fiscal Adjustment. Sri Lanka Can Move to a More Balanced Fiscal Policy, Says World Bank Public Finance Review\nCOLOMBO, September 9, 2025—Sri Lanka has made remarkable strides in stabilizing its economy, undertaking one of the largest fiscal adjustments in its history—equal to nearly 8 percent of GDP over three years. The adjustment was also sharper and faster by international standards – when compared with more than 330 similar efforts in 123 countries worldwide since 1980. A new World Bank review of Sri Lanka’s public finances released today says the country is now well-positioned to focus on making public finances work better for all Sri Lankans.\nThe World Bank’s Sri Lanka Public Finance Review: Towards a Balanced Fiscal Adjustment finds that while fiscal measures helped restore stability, they also put pressure on households through higher indirect taxes and reduced real public-sector wages, and slowed growth due to lower public investment. The next phase of fiscal calibration should prioritize raising revenues in ways that support growth and fairness, and improve the quality of government spending.\nThe review highlights that Sri Lanka could increase revenue by up to 2 percent of GDP by 2029 without undermining growth or equity. It also points out that better targeting and management of public spending can deliver improved outcomes within current budget limits.\nThe review recommends:\nRaising revenue more fairly and efficiently: shifting toward direct taxes, such as a minimum corporate income tax, and digitizing tax administration to make paying taxes easier and more transparent.\n-\nSpending smarter, not more or less: the report stresses that it is not feasible to further cut or increase overall spending, but the best gains will come from using existing funds more efficiently to get better results.\n-\nThis includes:\nImproving public sector wage management by protecting essential frontline services, simplifying pay structures, and modernizing systems through which public sector workers are paid.\n-\nReprioritizing capital investments to close infrastructure gaps, completing ongoing projects faster, and strengthening project selection, management and maintenance.\n-\nEnhancing social protection by better targeting assistance, expanding the social registry, and moving from universal subsidies to more focused support for those who need it most.\n-\n-\n“Now that Sri Lanka has largely stabilized its economy, the challenge is to get better results from every rupee collected and spent,” said David Sislen, World Bank Division Director for Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka. “This means modernizing tax administration, focusing on direct taxes, and making sure public spending is both efficient and fair—especially for the most vulnerable.”\nSri Lanka can design the next phase of its public finance reforms to build long-term fiscal resilience. Strengthening links between planning and budgeting, improving accountability, and focusing on measurable performance outcomes will help deliver better services, support inclusive growth, and protect the most vulnerable.\nAbout the Public Finance Review\nThe Public Finance Review (PFR) is a core World Bank diagnostic conducted every five years in member countries. It provides a comprehensive assessment of public finances—covering fiscal policy, revenues, and spending. The latest Sri Lanka PFR was prepared in close collaboration with the Ministry of Finance and supported by targeted technical assistance in priority areas.\nContacts\nIn Colombo\nBuddhi Feelixge\nbuddhifeelixge@worldbankgroup.org\nIn Washington\nDiana Chung\ndchung1@worldbank.org",
        "Sri Lanka Rises in 2025 but 2026 Could Bring a Hard Fall — ADB. by Our Economic Affairs Editor\nSri Lanka’s economy is set to expand by 3.9% in 2025, maintaining the momentum of recovery driven by remittances, tourism, and a rebound in domestic demand. According to the Asian Development Outlook September 2025 report by the Asian Development Bank, the country is benefiting from stronger private credit, a resurgence in industrial production, and an improved business climate. In the first quarter of the year, the economy grew by 4.8% compared with the same period in 2024, while the index of industrial production rose 5.1% year-on-year in the first half, nearly regaining pre-crisis levels. Lending conditions have also improved significantly, with private sector credit surging 19.6% by July, fueled by vehicle imports, low interest rates, and optimism in construction and services.\nInflation, which had been subdued for months, is slowly returning. Headline inflation dropped by 1.7% in the first eight months of 2025, largely due to lower energy and transport costs, while food inflation held at just 1.5%. Non-food prices, however, fell by 3.2%. Energy tariff adjustments in June pushed inflation upward, and it is forecast to average only 0.5% in 2025 before climbing to 4.5% in 2026. The Central Bank responded cautiously, cutting its key policy rate by 25 basis points in May to 7.75% before holding it steady, citing manageable inflation risks and the need to support growth.\nThe external sector showed signs of strengthening, as the current account surplus expanded by more than 30% in the first half of 2025. Worker remittances jumped by 19.3%, while tourism earnings climbed 8.4% as arrivals surpassed pre-pandemic levels. However, imports grew at a faster 12.4%, largely driven by vehicle purchases, compared with a 5.7% increase in exports. By August, gross official reserves stood at $6.2 billion, covering 3.7 months of imports, while the rupee had depreciated 3.3% against the US dollar since the start of the year.\nDespite signs of stabilization, debt remains a heavy burden. Public debt is expected to stay around 109% of GDP through 2025–2026. Progress has been made under the IMF’s Extended Fund Facility, with $1.74 billion disbursed so far and debt restructuring agreements secured with multiple creditors, including France, India, Japan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Kingdom. Completion of restructuring is targeted by the end of 2025, but fiscal discipline and reforms will be critical to sustaining stability.\nLooking ahead, Sri Lanka’s prospects for 2026 are clouded by external shocks. Economic growth is forecast to slow to 3.3% as the United States imposes 20% tariffs on key Sri Lankan exports such as garments and rubber, which together accounted for nearly a quarter of export earnings in 2024. These measures risk weakening export competitiveness, triggering job losses in vital industries, and curbing household consumption. Additional risks stem from instability in the Middle East, which could disrupt remittance inflows, as well as global energy price volatility and climate-related shocks to agriculture.\nWhile Sri Lanka’s recovery has gained traction in 2025, underpinned by remittances, tourism, and domestic demand, the country stands at a critical juncture. Success in managing debt restructuring and navigating external headwinds will determine whether its fragile growth path can be sustained in 2026 and beyond.",

        "OpenAI's 'full stack' dream comes into view. OpenAI is closer to resolving its Microsoft dispute, enabling a new corporate structure.\n-\nThe restructuring will help the AI pioneer raise funding more easily.\n-\nOpenAI needs the money to fuel an ambitious \"full stack\" strategy.\n-\nOpenAI is about to clear a major hurdle, freeing the startup to pursue an ambitious and expensive \"full stack\" strategy that could catapult it into the Big Tech big leagues or spiral the AI pioneer into a financial ball of flames.\nThe startup recently signed a memorandum of understanding to end a contractual fight with Microsoft. This will create a new corporate structure that helps OpenAI issue traditional equity, making it easier to raise the mountain of cash needed to pursue its dreams.\n\"Beyond boring corporate governance things, let's talk a little bit about the business,\" OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar said at the Goldman Sachs tech conference this week, after explaining the startup's complex restructuring. \"In terms of where we're going, think of OpenAI in terms of becoming very much a full stack company.\"\nBy full stack, Friar means a tech company that owns and operates every part of its business. Indeed, the startup is already working on its own solutions for almost every ingredient needed for AI success. That includes designing its own chips and building its own data centers, all the way up the stack to a suite of AI-powered software applications beyond ChatGPT.\n\"The company, as you look forward, will become very much a full stack company, with a lot of places that we can build both moats and really interesting business models,\" Friar explained.\nShe didn't say it, but the target is most likely Google. The search giant has spent 25 years developing the building blocks it needs to win in AI. That includes energy assets, specialized in-house chips, massive data centers, leading AI models, talent, developer platforms, wide distribution, and billions of consumer and enterprise touchpoints.\nOpenAI is a long way from Google's dominance, but the startup has several strategy beachheads from which to expand — both up and down the stack.\nOpenAI did not respond to a request for comment.\nEnergy\nAt the bottom of the AI tech stack, there's energy. GPUs, AI servers, and data centers consume unprecedented amounts of power. OpenAI doesn't have a clear answer here yet; however, CEO Sam Altman has personally backed several energy startups, including Helion, which is trying to use nuclear fusion to generate electricity.\nChips\nThen, there are AI chips that are essential for training and running AI models. OpenAI hired Richard Ho in late 2023 to lead its efforts here. He worked at Google for almost a decade, helping to develop the tech giant's TPUs, which power its AI models, including Gemini.\nData centers\nThose AI chips go in servers that are stacked inside giant data centers. OpenAI is currently working with all the major cloud providers, renting the computing power needed to train and run its models and chatbot service. However, Friar, the CFO, said on Tuesday that OpenAI will build its own data centers in the future.\n\"I've rarely seen scaled technology companies that don't own and operate their own infrastructure,\" Goldman Sachs internet analyst Eric Sheridan told Business Insider this week. \"This helps them control more of their own destinies over time.\"\nModels and developers\nAt the model layer, OpenAI has already established a beachhead, with a frontier offering, GPT-5, that is among the best. It also recently launched a powerful open-weight model.\nOn top of that, the startup has APIs that developers use to tap into these models. About 4 million developers have built on this OpenAI platform already.\nDistribution and gadgets\nWithout broad distribution, no one will use your AI products. OpenAI is working on new ways to get ChatGPT and other services to consumers. The startup bought Jony Ive's AI gadget startup for more than $6 billion a few months ago, and executives have hinted at form factors that could mean OpenAI's chatbot follows people wherever they go. It also launched a web browser, another powerful distribution tool.\nSoftware and applications\nThe startup is also trying to reach corporate customers, not just consumers. It already has roughly 5 million paid seats from ChatGPT business products. On Tuesday, Friar suggested that OpenAI might challenge established software companies at some point, or at least the startup's AI technology could support such disruption.\nThis takes OpenAI into the realm of applications, the software that sits on top of tech stacks and forms direct relationships with end users. ChatGPT has 700 million weekly average users, but the startup is looking beyond that.\nIn May, OpenAI hired Fidji Simo as CEO of Applications. The former Instacart CEO and Meta executive reports directly to Altman. This month, the startup brought on Vijaye Raji as CTO of Applications and acquired his startup, Statsig, for just over $1 billion.\nA few days later, Simo announced the OpenAI Jobs Platform, a new service that will match tech employers with qualified candidates. It looked eerily like LinkedIn, the professional network owned by its partner Microsoft.\nGoldman's Sheridan said the ultimate goal would probably look something like Google's suite of apps, which include not just Search, but also Maps, YouTube, Gmail, Calendar, Chrome, Classroom, Translate, Earth, Drive, Meet, Photos, Sheets, Docs, and Slides.\nTo build this entire AI stack itself and realize its dreams, OpenAI will need a mountain of cash, talent, and luck.\nSorting out its tortured corporate structure should help on the fundraising side. Indeed, without an agreement with Microsoft, OpenAI could miss out on at least $10 billion in funding from SoftBank. That cash infusion is looking a little more likely now.\nSign up for BI's Tech Memo newsletter here. Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",
        "Microsoft wants to build its own AI chip cluster — pivoting from OpenAI. Going solo? Microsoft wants to be \"self-sufficient in AI\" — building its own chip cluster to reduce its reliance on OpenAI\nAI CEO Mustafa Suleyman says Microsoft could break away from a reliance on OpenAI, given its size and diversity.\nMicrosoft and OpenAI's multibillion-dollar partnership has been going through some turbulence over the past few years. The tension dates back to when Sam Altman was abruptly ousted as OpenAI CEO by the company's board of directors for not being \"consistently candid\" with his leadership and operations.\nThings haven't been the same since, though Sam Altman was reinstated as CEO after an outcry from his counterparts, who threatened to leave the company while reiterating that \"OpenAI is nothing without its people.\"\nAt the beginning of this year, the ChatGPT maker unveiled its $500 billion Stargate project designed to facilitate the construction of data centers across the United States to support its sophisticated AI advances.\nThe move hit the tech industry by storm, with leaders like Salesforce's Marc Benioff predicting that Microsoft won't use OpenAI's technology in the future. Consequently, the software giant lost its exclusive cloud provider status for OpenAI, though it still holds the right of refusal.\nOpenAI had previously complained that Microsoft doesn't meet its cloud computing needs, shifting blame to the software giant if a rival AI lab achieved the coveted AGI (artificial general intelligence) benchmark first.\nMore recently, Microsoft reportedly wiggled out of two mega data center deals because it did not want to provide additional training support for ChatGPT. However, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman seemingly refuted the claims, indicating that the company was no longer compute-constrained.\nOpenAI's market valuation recently skyrocketed to $300 billion after raising $40 billion through its latest round of funding led by SoftBank. However, the ChatGPT maker is under immense pressure from investors to convert into a for-profit entity. Failure to meet this threshold by the end of the year could cost investor funding, coupled with outsider interference and potential hostile takeovers.\nAll the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.\nReports suggest that Microsoft is holding back OpenAI's for-profit evolution plans because it hasn't greenlit the proposal (being the AI firm's largest backer with a $14 billion stake) to protect its best interests.\nMicrosoft dismissed these claims and indicated that it was willing to walk away from the high-stakes negotiations and ride out the partnership through 2030. On the other hand, OpenAI reportedly wanted to prematurely declare AGI to sever its ties with Microsoft to loosen the tech giant's grip on its Intellectual Property and technology.\nThe software giant has been making leaps in the AI landscape, especially after Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman revealed that the company is developing its own off-frontier models, which will be 3 to 6 months behind OpenAI's.\nThe executive further indicated that the company's plan is to play a close second. It's also worth noting that the tech giant has been testing third-party AI models in Copilot.\nMicrosoft wants to break free from its over dependence on OpenAI\nAnd as it now seems, Microsoft is seemingly trying to establish its own dominance in the AI landscape by creating its own path, potentially emancipating itself from an overreliance on OpenAI and its tech. Business Insider's Ashley Stewart reports that Microsoft plans to make \"significant investments\" in building and developing its own AI chip cluster to unlock self-sufficiency in AI.\nDuring a recent all-employee town hall meeting, Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman indicated: \"It's critical that a company of our size, with the diversity of businesses that we have, that we are, you know, able to be self sufficient in AI, if we choose to.\"\nMicrosoft is seemingly moving away from its overdependence on OpenAI and venturing into new opportunities, including using open-source models, building its own AI models, and partnering with other AI developers.\nOpenAI and Microsoft sign an MOU to advance their partnership\nMore recently, OpenAI and Microsoft signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding (MOU) for the next phase of their multibillion-dollar partnership as the latter strives to chase its for-profit evolution goals before the year ends.\nOpenAI and Microsoft have signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding (MOU) for the next phase of our partnership.We are actively working to finalize contractual terms in a definitive agreement. Together, we remain focused on delivering the best AI tools for everyone,…September 11, 2025\nHowever, the announcement didn't disclose intricate details about the contents of the MOU, as both parties are still finalizing contractual terms of the new agreement, though OpenAI reiterates its commitment to maintain safety through the AI tools it delivers amid claims that it prioritizes shiny products like AGI over safety processes.\nWhat's more, the company highlighted that it launched as a non-profit organization and is committed to its founding mission. The non-profit will hold control over the company's direction and operations.\n\"As outlined in our non-binding MOU with Microsoft, the OpenAI nonprofit’s ongoing control would now be paired with an equity stake in the PBC,\" OpenAI added.\nKevin Okemwa is a seasoned tech journalist based in Nairobi, Kenya with lots of experience covering the latest trends and developments in the industry at Windows Central.

        "OpenAI shows off Stargate AI data center in Texas and plans 5 more elsewhere with Oracle, Softbank. OpenAI shows off Stargate AI data center in Texas and plans 5 more elsewhere with Oracle, Softbank\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman has announced that the Stargate AI data center in Texas will be joined by five more across the U.S. This expansion is part of a $500 billion infrastructure investment promoted by President Donald Trump\nABILENE, Texas -- The afternoon sun was so hot that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman traded his usual crewneck sweater for a T-shirt on the last legs of a Tuesday visit to the massive Stargate artificial intelligence data center complex that will power the future of ChatGPT.\nOpenAI announced Tuesday that its flagship AI data center in Texas will be joined by five others around the U.S. as the ChatGPT maker aims to make good on the $500 billion infrastructure investment promoted by President Donald Trump earlier this year.\nStargate, a joint venture between OpenAI, Oracle and Softbank, said it is building two more data center complexes in Texas, one in New Mexico, one in Ohio and another in a Midwest location it hasn't yet disclosed.\nBut it's the project in Abilene, Texas, that promised to be the biggest of them all, transforming what the city's mayor called an old railroad town.\nOracle executives visiting the eight-building complex said it is already on track to be the world’s largest AI supercluster once fully built, a reference to its network of hundreds of thousands of AI computer chips that will be running in its H-shaped buildings.\nAltman said, “When you hit that button on ChatGPT, you really don’t — I don’t, at least” — think about what happens inside the data halls used to build and operate the chatbot.\nHe and Oracle's new co-CEO Clay Magouyrk also sought to emphasize the steps they've taken to reduce the energy-hungry complex's environmental effects on a drought-prone region of West Texas, where temperatures hit 97 degrees Fahrenheit (36 degrees Celsius) on Tuesday.\n“We’re burning gas to run this data center,” said Altman, but added that “in the long trajectory of Stargate” the hope is to rely on many other power sources.\nThe complex will require about 900 megawatts of electricity to power the eight buildings.\nOne is already operating, and a second that Altman and Magouyrk visited Tuesday is nearly complete. Each server rack in those buildings holds 72 of Nvidia’s GB200 chips, which are specially designed for the most intensive AI workloads. Each building is expected to have about 60,000 of them.\nMore than 6,000 workers now commute to the massive construction project each day, in what Mayor Weldon Hurt described as a significant boost to the local economy. The campus and nearby expansion will provide nearly 1,700 jobs onsite when fully operational, Oracle said, with “thousands more indirect jobs” predicted to be created.\nHand-made signs lining the roads to the facility advertise “move-in-ready\" homes for workers.\n“AI WORKERS? HUGE DISCOUNTS” says one promising homes with one to six bedrooms.\nBut Hurt also acknowledged that residents have mixed feelings about the project due to its water and energy needs.\nThe city's chronically stressed reservoirs were at roughly half-capacity this week. Residents must follow a two-day-a-week outdoor watering schedule, trading off based on whether their address numbers are odd or even.\nOne million gallons of water from the city's municipal water systems provides an “initial fill” for a closed-loop system that cools the data center's computers and keeps the water from evaporating. After that initial fill, Oracle expects each of the eight buildings to need another 12,000 gallons per year, which it describes as a “remarkably low figure for a facility of this scale.”\n“These data centers are designed to not use water,” Magouyrk said. “All of the data centers that we’re building (in) this part of Stargate are designed to not use water. The reason we do that is because it turns out that’s harmful for the environment and this is a better solution.”\nThe closed-loop system shows that the developer is “taking its impact on local public water supplies seriously,” but the overall environmental effect is more nuanced because such systems require more electricity, which also means higher indirect water usage through power generation, said Shaolei Ren, a professor at the University of California, Riverside, who has studied AI's environmental toll.\nIndeed, the data center complex includes a new gas-fired power plant, using natural gas turbines similar to those that power warships. The companies say the plant is meant to provide backup power for the data halls and is a better option than traditional diesel generators. Most of the power comes from the local grid, sourced from a mix of natural gas with the sprawling wind and solar farms that dot the windy and sunny region.\nRen said that “even with emission-reduction measures, the health impacts of essentially turning the data center site into a power plant deserve further study for nearby communities.”\nArlene Mendler, a Stargate neighbor, said she wished she had more say in the project that eliminated a vast tract of mesquite shrubland, home to coyotes and roadrunners.\n“It has completely changed the way we were living,” said Mendler, who lives across the street. “We moved up here 33 years ago for the peace, quiet, tranquility. After we got home from work, we could ride horses down the road. It was that type of a place.”\nNow, she doesn't know what to do about the constant cacophony of construction sounds or the bright lights that have altered her nighttime views. The project was essentially a done deal once she found out about it.\n“They took 1,200 acres and just scraped it to bare dirt,” said her husband, Fred Mendler.\nThe first time most residents heard of Stargate — at least by that name — was when Trump announced the project shortly after returning to the White House in January. Originally planned as a facility to mine cryptocurrency, developers had pivoted and expanded their designs to tailor the project to the AI boom sparked by ChatGPT.\nThe partnership said at that time it was investing $100 billion — and eventually up to $500 billion — to build large-scale data centers and the energy generation needed to further AI development. More recently, OpenAI signed a $300 billion deal to buy computing capacity from Oracle. It's a huge bet for the San Francisco-based AI startup, which was founded as a nonprofit.\nOpenAI and Oracle invited media and politicians, including U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, to tour the site for the first time Tuesday.\nCruz called Texas “ground zero for AI” because if “you’re building a data center, what do you want? No. 1, you want abundant, low-cost energy.”\nOf the other five Stargate data center projects announced Tuesday, Oracle is working with OpenAI to build one just northeast of Abilene, in Shackelford County, Texas, and another in New Mexico's Doña Ana County. It also said it is working to build one in the Midwest.\nSoftbank said it has broken ground on two more in Lordstown, Ohio, and in Milam County, Texas.\nThe projects offer OpenAI a way to break out from its longtime partnership with Microsoft, which until recently was the startup's exclusive computing partner. Altman told The Associated Press his company has been “severely limited for the value we can offer to people.”\n“ChatGPT is slow. It’s not as smart as we’d like to be. Many users can’t use it as much as they would like,\" Altman said. \"We have many other ideas and products we want to build.”\n——-\nThe Associated Press and OpenAI have a licensing and technology agreement that allows OpenAI access to part of AP’s text archives.\nSponsored Content by Taboola\nPopular Reads\nABC News Live\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

        "US designates Colombia as country 'failing to cooperate in drug war'. US designates Colombia as country 'failing to cooperate in drug war'\nThe United States has officially named Colombia as a country which has \"demonstrably failed\" to uphold its obligations to control drug trafficking, but stopped short of cutting off the flow of US aid to Colombia.\nEach year, the US government formally certifies whether several countries are fully co-operating with US-led counternarcotic efforts, and those which are found to be wanting risk having their US funding cut.\nOn Monday, the Trump administration said that cocaine production in Colombia had surged to all-time high records under its left-wing president, Gustavo Petro, which the Colombian leader denied.\nIn response, the Colombian government said it would stop buying weapons from the US.\nInterior Minister Armando Benedetti told local radio that his government would stop the purchase of US arms \"from this moment on\".\nThe other countries the US said had failed to meet their targets were Afghanistan, Bolivia, Myanmar and Venezuela.\nColombia was added to the list for the first time since 1997.\nThe move is likely to further sour relations between its left-wing government and the Trump administration.\nPresident Petro took to social media to respond to the US allegation that during his time in office the area planted with coca bushes and the production of cocaine had reached record levels.\nCoca leaves are the key ingredient in cocaine and Colombia has long been the top producer of the illegal drug.\nA survey by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNDOC) found that coca bush cultivation had increased by 10% in 2023. The figures for 2024 are due to be released next month.\nBut Petro insisted that it had been during the government of Iván Duque, his predecessor in office who governed from 2018 to 2022, that the area planted with coca saw large increases.\nAccording to figures released by the Colombian presidency, a record 1,764 tonnes of cocaine were seized by government security forces between August 2022, when Petro came into office, and November 2024. Drug seizures have continued at a high level in 2025, official tallies suggest.\nPetro also said that in order for coca cultivation to decrease, what was needed was for demand for cocaine to go down in the US and in Europe.\nThe US on the other hand laid the blame firmly at Petro's door, saying that the president's peace talks with several armed groups - many of which finance themselves through drug trafficking - had hindered the fight against drugs.\n\"His failed attempts to seek accommodations with narco-terrorist groups only exacerbated the crisis,\" the presidential determination submitted to US Congress said.\nThe document goes on to praise the \"skill and courage\" of Colombia's security forces in confronting criminal groups.\nIt then concluded that \"the failure of Colombia to meet its drug control obligations over the past year rests solely with its political leadership\".\nHowever, it does leave the door open to recertifying Colombia if its government \"takes more aggressive action to eradicate coca and reduce cocaine production and trafficking\".\nAnd while the rhetoric coming out of Washington has clearly angered President Petro, his government will also be relieved that the decertification did not result in a cut of the US aid flow, BBC News Mundo's correspondent in Bogotá, José Carlos Cueto, says.\nColombia's decertification comes at a time when President Trump has made the fight against \"narco-terrorists\" a priority.\nOn Monday he announced the US military had destroyed an alleged Venezuelan drug vessel in international waters in the South Caribbean.\nThree people were killed in the strike, Trump said.\nHe added the US had recorded proof that the boats belonged to narco-terrorist groups but has not yet made that evidence public.\nWith additional reporting by BBC Monitoring's Latin America specialist, Luis Fajardo",
        "US decertifies Colombia as ally in drugs fight. The United States said Monday it has decertified Colombia as an ally in the fight against drugs, a decision that could cost Bogota hundreds of millions of dollars in US military support.\nDespite decades of close alliance in the so-called war on drugs, US President Donald Trump slammed his Colombian counterpart Gustavo Petro for not only failing to curb cocaine production, but overseeing its surge to \"all-time records,\" according to a signed determination the White House sent to Congress on Monday.\n\"Under President Petro's leadership, coca cultivation and cocaine production have reached record highs while Colombia's government failed to meet even its own vastly reduced coca eradication goals, undermining years of mutually beneficial cooperation between our two countries against narco-terrorists,\" Trump wrote.\nWashington has conducted assessments annually since 1986 on the anti-narcotics efforts of some 20 drug-producing and distributing countries.\nIn the case of Colombia, the US assistance for anti-narcotics efforts reached some $380 million annually, a figure which is now in jeopardy.\nIn a meeting with his cabinet, leftist Petro confirmed the change, saying \"the United States is decertifying us after dozens of deaths of police officers and soldiers\" in the fight against drug cartels and leftist guerrillas funded by drug trafficking.\nSince coming to power in 2022, Petro has championed a paradigm shift in the US-led war on drugs, which he considers a failure, to focus on the social problems that fuel drug trafficking.\nSince 2022, coca cultivation has increased by about 70 percent, according to Colombian government and United Nations estimates.\nTo regain the designation, Trump called on Colombia's government to take \"more aggressive action to eradicate coca and reduce cocaine production and trafficking.\"\nHe also urged them to \"hold those producing, trafficking and benefiting from the production of cocaine responsible, including through improved cooperation with the United States to bring the leaders of Colombian criminal organizations to justice.\"\n- 'Failure' by leadership -\nThe decertification is seen as punishment for the failure by the world's biggest cocaine producer to curb cultivation of coca, the key ingredient in cocaine, and trafficking of the drug to global markets.\nIt comes amid a major drive by Trump against drug cartels, in which US forces have blown up two suspected Venezuelan drug boats, killing a total of 14 people.\nDespite the decertification, US officials praised Colombia's authorities for continuing \"to show the skill and courage in confronting terrorist and criminal groups,\" adding that the US appreciates the South American country's public servants, laying blame squarely with Petro.\n\"The failure of Colombia to meet its drug control obligations over the past year rests solely with its political leadership,\" Trump wrote, also touching on Venezuela and Bolivia's efforts to curb cocaine trafficking.\nThe downgrade is a major blow for Colombia, coming as the military and police reel from a string of deadly attacks by the guerrillas.\nWashington's disavowal of Petro had been expected since January, when he became embroiled in a blazing row with Trump over migrant deportations.\nIn Colombia, the military and police are reeling from a string of deadly attacks by guerrilla groups.\nOn August 21, 12 police officers were killed when breakaway members of the defunct FARC rebel group shot down a police helicopter during a coca eradication operation in the country's northwest.\nOn the same day, a truck bomb was detonated on a busy street near a military aviation school in the city of Cali, killing six people.\nals/cb/sla/mlm\n(0) comments\nWelcome to the discussion.\nLog In\nKeep it Clean.

        "A female president leads Mexican Independence celebrations for the first time. A female president leads Mexican Independence celebrations for the first time\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has become the first female leader to preside over the country’s independence celebrations in 215 years\nMEXICO CITY -- MEXICO CITY (AP) — President Claudia Sheinbaum became the first female leader to preside over Mexico's independence celebrations in 215 years, with a message that she won’t accept foreign intervention, a significant statement as she negotiates pressure from the United States.\nSheinbaum led a traditional ceremony from the balcony of the National Palace in Mexico City known as the “grito,” or “shout” in English, Monday night. It’s an annual tradition when on Sept. 15, the president rings a bell marking the call to arms during the 1810-1821 fight to win independence from Spain.\nIndependence Day is formally celebrated Sept. 16, but the “grito” ceremony has been performed the night before for over a century.\nA traditional military parade followed Tuesday, and Sheinbaum reiterated that “No foreign power makes decisions for us.”\nIn a speech before her Cabinet and thousands of soldiers, Sheinbaum added that “no interference is possible in our homeland” and although she didn’t mention any particular country, her words come at a moment when the U.S government has asked Mexico to do more to crack down on drug cartels and strengthen border security.\nU.S. President Donald Trump ’s administration has even offered to send U.S. troops to fight cartels, some of them declared as terrorist organizations by his government, but Sheinbaum has repeatedly rejected it.\nHer administration has been more aggressive in pursuing the cartels than her predecessor, handing over dozens of cartel figures to American authorities and pointing to lower fentanyl seizures at the U.S. border. But Sheinbaum insists that the actions have been carried out because they’re good for Mexico, not because of U.S. pressure.\nSheinbaum took power in October as Mexico's first female president.\nSponsored Content by Taboola\nPopular Reads\nABC News Live\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

        "At the UN, African leaders did not draw attention to home conflicts, analysts say. Ope Adetayo, Associated Press\nOpe Adetayo, Associated Press\nLeave your feedback\nLAGOS, Nigeria (AP) — They had a lot to say about global affairs. But complicated things happening closer to home? Not so much.\nLike their counterparts from other continents, African leaders took to the United Nations podium over the past week to address the U.N. General Assembly on pressing global issues, including climate change, inequality and the spread of conflict.\nWATCH LIVE: Day 7 of the 2025 United Nations General Assembly\nAfrican leaders — including Nigerian Vice President Kassim Shettima, Senegalese President Bassirou Faye and Namibian President Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah — spoke vehemently about global conflicts and called for an end to Israel’s attacks on Gaza.\n“The people of Palestine are not collateral damage in a civilization that is searching for order. They are human beings, equal in worth, entitled to the same freedoms and dignities that the rest of us take for granted,” Shettima said last week.\nHowever, analysts say two of Africa’s most complicated conflicts in Sudan and Congo, which have killed thousands of people and both reached an impasse, were given barely any significant airtime by African leaders.\n“African countries have sort of stepped back to some extent in terms of wanting to place African issues at the forefront of the U.N. agenda,” said Chris Ogunmodede, an Africa affairs analyst with experience working in African diplomatic circles. “On the most important dates on the U.N. calendar, there is nothing to say about African issues in any substantive way.”\nWar in Sudan, the world’s biggest humanitarian crisis, broke out in mid-2023 when a paramilitary outfit launched an assault on the central African country’s armed forces, both of which had ruled together for years. The conflict rapidly descended into a full-blown civil war, which has now effectively partitioned the country into two and has killed at least 40,000 people.\nThe army regained control of the capital in a watershed moment in the war and pushed the rebel group Rapid Support Forces mainly to Darfur, the western region of the country.\nThe U.N. has accused both sides of mass atrocities and warned of famine in parts of Sudan, as both groups have imposed restrictions on food and aid distribution as the fight continues. A drone strike earlier this month killed at least 70 people in besieged El-Fasher.\nIn January, the M23 rebel group, backed by Rwanda, launched a blitz of attacks in the eastern region of Congo and rapidly took key cities. The conflict has since killed roughly 7,000 people, with millions of others displaced or trapped in rebel-held cities.\nAccording to the U.N., over 100 rebel groups are fighting in the mineral-rich eastern region of the Congo. A Doha peace initiative reached a deal between Congo and the M23 group, but fighting has continued.\n“The cursory mentions of DR Congo and Sudan were a missed opportunity by African leaders to really highlight how pronounced the humanitarian crises have become,” said Beverly Ochieng, a senior security analyst at Control Risks.\nThe General Assembly speeches, analysts say, demonstrate the lack of interest from African leaders in solving these conflicts. They also reflect institutional problems with the continent’s own multilateral organizations, where African leaders are absent at the negotiating tables.\n“We are seeing the reality of the limitations of African institutions and states, the limitations of their own ability to pursue their own international affairs,” Ogunmodede said.\nLeading negotiations for conflicts are external powers, some of whom have been accused of being a party to the conflicts. Last week on the U.N. sidelines, a group of diplomatic leaders from the U.S., the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Egypt ramp up efforts to end the war in Sudan. A Washington-led peace deal between Congo and Rwanda is expected to be signed in the coming weeks.\nSince both wars broke out, they have quickly taken on complex geopolitical dynamics with various competing powers. The U.N. said Rwanda backs the M23 rebel group in Congo, and the conflict has also pulled in neighboring countries like Burundi and Uganda.\nIn March, Sudanese armed forces filed a case to the U.N. top court against the UAE, accusing it of arming its major adversary and breaching the genocide convention. The UAE denies the allegations.\n“The outside interests have leverage, and that compels armed actors to deal with peace mechanism coming from outside,” Ochieng said. “With African institutions, they do not have as much leverage institutionally or being able to provide additional incentives for peace and security initiatives.”\nStand up for truly independent, trusted news that you can count on!\nSupport Provided By:\nLearn more\nSubscribe to Here’s the Deal, our politics\nnewsletter for analysis you won’t find anywhere else.\nThank you.

        "World: Ten Challenges for the UN in 2025-2026. As the annual high-level meeting of the General Assembly at the UN approaches, the organisation faces severe political and financial challenges. But it can still use sanctions, peace operations and aid to address mounting crises.\nWhat’s new? Leaders gathering at the UN General Assembly will find a world organisation in trauma. U.S. funding cuts have hit the UN hard, forcing it into sweeping reductions in staff. Struggling to resolve conflicts or help civilians in places from Gaza to Sudan, the institution appears to be losing its relevance.\nWhy does it matter? Despite its many flaws, the UN handles humanitarian and peacekeeping tasks that few other organisations can undertake. It offers a safety net for the vulnerable in numerous war zones and a channel for communication among states about divisive issues. Its decline corrodes a buffer keeping many armed conflicts from worsening.\nWhat should be done? Though the UN cannot avoid retrenchment, its member states should try to minimise the fallout. They can offer the organisation political, diplomatic and financial support in tackling both headline-grabbing crises and forgotten ones. They can also work with international officials to reform the institution as it weathers today’s global turbulence.\nI.Overview\nWhen leaders arrive in New York in late September for the UN General Assembly’s annual high-level week, they will find an institution whose condition has veered from bad to worse. The UN system has been in poor shape for some time, with tensions among major powers repeatedly foiling diplomacy at the Security Council. But the return of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency in January has precipitated an even more pronounced downturn in the organisation’s fortunes. The U.S., the organisation’s single largest donor, has cut or frozen large tranches of funding for the UN and its agencies, eviscerating humanitarian aid operations in particular. It has also quit a raft of multilateral agreements, pursued unilateral peace initiatives with little reference to the UN and at times seemed to dismiss key tenets of the UN Charter, such as respect for the territorial integrity of states. The wider UN membership now faces tough choices about how to manage the fallout of U.S. decisions, both for the UN as an institution and for the various crises where it is engaged. In many cases, their task will amount to damage control, but it will still be vital.\nTo date, the organisation’s other members have offered it only tepid support in withstanding the shock waves coming from the Trump White House. Many capitals, along with their diplomats in New York and Geneva, agree at least in part with Washington’s longstanding criticism of the UN as bloated and cast its present financial woes as a necessary reckoning. Secretary-General António Guterres is thus encumbered with cutting the institution down to size. As part of a reform process entitled UN80, he has promised that the UN Secretariat will shed about a fifth of its staff. Aid agencies such as the World Food Programme, which rely heavily on U.S. funds, are making even bigger cuts. Morale among UN staff is plumbing new depths.\nThe organisation’s travails are not solely budgetary. The UN faces political pushback and operational threats in a series of conflict zones. The most egregious and widely cited example is the calamity in Gaza, where Israel (with U.S. backing) has sidelined UN aid efforts, accusing the organisation of complicity with Hamas. But the phenomenon extends further. In the last year, to adduce just a few examples, warring factions have blocked UN diplomacy and humanitarian assistance in Sudan, while rebel groups have killed blue-helmet peacekeepers in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and South Sudan. In the meantime, Security Council discussions about how to help troubled countries such as Haiti and Somalia have languished in part due to a lack of U.S. engagement, while the UN has made no progress in resolving major conflicts – including those in Sudan and Myanmar – which have intermittently been priorities for the Council in recent years. In some cases it has proven impossible even to get life-saving aid to those who need it.\nAmid the chaos of today’s world, there has been little real debate at the UN about where the organisation is headed.\nAmid the chaos of today’s world, there has been little real debate at the UN about where the organisation is headed. Trump administration officials have said they want to see the UN focus on its “founding purpose” of upholding peace and security. Many Western diplomats agree that the organisation – which turned 80 in June 2025 – should concentrate on its basic goal of international stability. Representatives of non-Western countries nevertheless worry that such a reorientation will mean that economic development gets short shrift. Diplomats and international officials tend to agree that potentially acrimonious discussions about the UN’s future strategy will have to await the arrival of a new Secretary-General in January 2027.\nIn the meantime, UN members should address the immediate challenges and opportunities facing the organisation. It is easy to discern the UN’s malaise, but it is worth keeping in mind that the institution remains engaged in numerous important peace processes and relief efforts. It is particularly difficult – and sometimes even impossible – for other actors to replicate the UN’s capacity to run complex relief operations. The Security Council is still a clearinghouse for initiatives dealing with unexpected events, such as the fall of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria, as well as diplomacy on both high-profile matters – such as recognition of the State of Palestine and proliferation-related sanctions against Iran – and largely neglected crises like that in Afghanistan. The UN system is undoubtedly in crisis, but there is no credible alternative available to handle this range of responsibilities.\nII.The Year in Review: Trends in UN Diplomacy\nThe UN was grappling with several challenges before President Trump assumed office for a second time on 20 January.1 The outgoing Biden administration had tried to push the Security Council toward ending the civil war in Sudan and bolstering security in Haiti, but China and Russia were unwilling to support new initiatives on these files. The U.S., meanwhile, continued to stymie UN action regarding the Israel-Hamas war. Beyond the Council, the UN system struggled with cash flow problems stemming from the late payment of dues by member states including China and the U.S.2 UN members and officials presumed that, as in his first term, Trump would be disdainful of multilateralism. But there was little sense of how bad relations with the U.S. would become.\nA.The Trump Shock\nThe Trump administration’s challenge to the UN and international cooperation more generally has unfolded on a scale, and at a speed, that few were ready for. It was predictable that the president would pull out of the Paris climate change agreement on his first day in office and that he would withdraw the U.S. from a series of other UN frameworks like the Human Rights Council and the UN Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization in the ensuing months. Similar moves had been made in his first term.\nBut few within the UN expected the wave of U.S. aid cuts and freezes that washed over the organisation and its agencies in late January. It hit first in Geneva and Rome, where some of the largest UN humanitarian agencies are based. The World Food Programme (WFP) – which relied on Washington to cover half of its $9 billion budget in 2024, and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), which got two fifths of its funding from the U.S. – watched that money dwindle to a trickle. The agencies soon announced that they would have to lay off thousands of staffers.3 UN entities working for gender equality, including by curbing sexual and gender-based violence, quickly realised the grave financial threat they were under as U.S. diplomats objected to the UN even using the word “gender” in its documents, and took a more restrictive stance on sexual and reproductive health than Trump’s previous administration had (see Section III.8).4 The U.S. further shocked diplomats by turning against the Sustainable Development Goals, a set of non-binding commitments that have framed the UN’s work to eradicate poverty and promote development since 2015.5\nThe U.S. has pointed to a number of UN missions, such as the residual presence in Kosovo, as ripe for closure.\nThe Trump administration’s attitude toward the UN’s peacekeeping arm has been less uniformly hostile, but often unfriendly. Early in the year, optimistic UN officials noted that U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasised the need for the UN to focus on peace and security. Washington backed the renewal of some mandates for existing peace operations in the Security Council, such as that in South Sudan. Members of the administration talked about the need to reform missions (by, for example, giving them clearer exit strategies) rather than scrap them altogether.6 Nonetheless, the blue helmets have not been entirely spared. The U.S. has pointed to a number of UN missions, such as the residual presence in Kosovo, as ripe for closure. This summer it pushed for the UN Interim Force in Lebanon, one of the largest and longest-standing blue-helmet operations, to shut down in 2027.7 In May the administration announced its intention to halt future funding for the UN’s peacekeeping budget, and in late August committed to rescind contributions that Congress had already appropriated for 2024 and 2025.8\nIn any event, it has been hard for international officials and diplomats in New York and Geneva to divine the administration’s stance on the UN more broadly, as they have had no senior interlocutors from Washington to talk to. President Trump withdrew his first nominee for U.S. Permanent Representative to the UN, Elise Stefanik, in March so she could keep her seat in Congress (thus safeguarding the House of Representatives’ slender Republican majority). The White House announced in May that former National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, having left the White House after a turbulent few months, would fill the slot, but his confirmation hearings have dragged out over the ensuing months. Holdover teams of diplomats have continued to represent the U.S. in UN forums. UN officials and member states alike have been left in the dark about whether the Trump White House has a long-term plan for how to deal with the UN or whether to partially restore U.S. funding.\nB.The UN Response\nThe UN Secretariat and other member states alike were caught flat-footed by the alacrity with which the U.S. tightened its purse strings. Other traditional donors to UN operations, such as European governments, made clear that they could not fill the gaps Washington was creating. While some international officials hoped that China or the Gulf countries would help, none have replaced U.S. funds at full scale.9 Diplomats and UN officials now speak of the need to do “less with less”.10\nTo date, member states have largely left the task of defining what austerity means to Guterres. The Secretary-General did not relish the opportunity – reportedly hoping to spend his final years in office focusing on personal priorities like the international regulation of artificial intelligence. But in March he announced the UN80 reform process, nodding to the eightieth anniversary of the UN Charter.11 This process includes three tracks: one hunting for immediate savings, a second reviewing the UN’s caseload of inter-governmental mandates, and a third looking at institutional reforms. So far, the Secretary-General has taken the most action on the first track – declaring in May that all parts of the Secretariat must cut a fifth of their staff in 2026 – while assigning working groups, each representing a different cluster of UN entities, the job of plotting possible courses of longer-term restructuring.12\nThe Secretary-General has also insisted that he lacks the authority to suggest what activities the UN should or should not keep pursuing, instead deferring these questions to the UN’s membership.13 Given that the Secretary-General’s team have counted nearly 4,000mandates from UN member states that are the responsibility of the Secretariat alone, most New York-based diplomats view the prospect of retrenchment nervously.14 Different blocs of UN members have largely avoided public disputes about how the organisation should redirect its shrunken resources. While Western officials talk of the need to get “back to basics” (code for emphasising peace and security), representatives from the so-called Global South insist that the UN should not veer away from its development commitments. Diplomats from all camps agree that these questions will eventually come up for debate, but they are happy to delay such contentious discussions.\nC.Crisis Management and UN Diplomacy\nWhile U.S. policy has forced diplomats to concentrate on financial and institutional questions for much of the year, they have also had to deal with the fallout of concurrent crises. As in late 2023 and throughout 2024, the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza has dominated discussions in New York. For many UN members, Israel’s deliberate strategy of sidelining the UN from both political and humanitarian responses to the war (described further in Section III.1) has thrown into doubt the world organisation’s credibility, given that its involvement with Palestine dates to the 1940s. Yet while members of the Security Council and General Assembly have looked for ways to influence the course of events in the Middle East, they have also struggled to address a litany of other worsening problems.\nThe Security Council\nAfter a period in which major-power disputes regularly hamstrung the Security Council – often along East-West lines – relations among China, Russia and the U.S. have fluctuated less predictably so far in 2025. The U.S. created consternation among its European allies in the Council in February when, with little warning, it tabled a resolution “imploring” Moscow and Kyiv to strike a quick peace deal with no reference to Ukraine’s territorial integrity, which has been violated by Russian aggression.15 Diplomats interpreted this resolution – which passed with ten votes despite the five European members abstaining – as a sign that President Trump might see the Council as a mechanism for broader rapprochement with Russia.\nNotwithstanding these early expectations, the change in U.S.-Russian relations in the Council has been far from ground-breaking. In the months that followed, the U.S. made a point of improving cooperation on Syria in the Council (jointly drafting a statement on the burst of violence in that country’s coastal regions in March) and Russia has notably toned down its criticisms of U.S. support for the Israeli military campaign in Gaza.16 U.S. and Russian officials have also become more assertive in dealing with the elected ten members of the Council over procedural issues (the other permanent members have sometimes followed suit).17 But the two powers continued to spar over other topics, including North Korea’s nuclear program.\nIn contrast, Washington showed little immediate inclination to improve relations with China in the Council, making a concerted effort to stop Beijing taking a greater diplomatic role on Afghanistan.18 Tensions among the three powers peaked during the twelve-day Israeli-Iranian war in June, when China, Russia and Algeria (occupying the Council’s Arab seat in 2024-2025) circulated a draft resolution condemning not only Israeli but also U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.19 Though they abandoned this text soon after hostilities ended, it highlighted the persistent mistrust among the veto-wielding powers that intensified further after the U.S. backed a push by Britain, France and Germany to reimpose sanctions on Iran suspended as part of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (see Section III.9).\nMore often than not, U.S. diplomacy in the Council has been adrift.\nMore often than not, U.S. diplomacy in the Council has been adrift. U.S. diplomats have often struggled to get clear instructions from Washington on how to handle issues – such as the crises in Haiti and Sudan – that had been bigger (if intermittent) priorities under President Joe Biden. On occasion, Washington’s interest in an item on the Council’s agenda has been pricked. In April and May, it pushed hard for the Council to renew the mandate for the UN peacekeeping force in South Sudan at a time when that country seemed close to renewed civil war.20 On other occasions, the U.S. stance has been more averse to UN-led peace efforts. In May, Washington refused to sign onto a proposal – reluctantly greenlit by the Biden administration in December 2024 – for the UN to use assessed contributions to fund the African Union (AU) stabilisation mission in Somalia.21 The reversal set back an AU initiative under way since 2007 to get more reliable UN support for its deployment.\nEven if U.S. engagement in Council affairs blinks on and off, the fear of run-ins with Washington has led other members of the body to tread cautiously. The most obvious indicator has been discord over Gaza. Following the Hamas atrocities on 7 October 2023, Council members regularly aimed to put pressure on Israel and the U.S. to support an end to hostilities by tabling Council resolutions, though the Biden administration blocked many of these.22 By contrast, Council members were more restrained in the first half of 2025, even as Israel began an intensified siege of Gaza, and did not table a ceasefire resolution until June.23 This pullback apparently reflected their concerns – shared by the Palestinian mission to the UN – that forcing a showdown would spur the Trump administration to react with a show of displeasure, though in the end the U.S. simply vetoed the June resolution and moved on with little fuss.\nThe General Assembly\nThe conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza have remained major items of business in the General Assembly as well. The body has continued to speak out against Russia’s war in Ukraine, though some members have appeared warier of doing so. In February, the Assembly backed a resolution tabled by Kyiv and the European Union, but opposed by the U.S., marking the third anniversary of Russia’s all-out aggression and reasserting Ukraine’s sovereign territorial rights. But this text got only 93 yes votes, compared to 141 for a similar text in February 2023.24 The decline was partly a product of U.S. lobbying, but it also reflected a tendency among UN members – especially those disappointed by Western positioning over Gaza – to disassociate themselves from discussions of Ukraine.\nThe Assembly passed a resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza after the U.S. vetoed the Council resolution on the issue in June, but the UN’s most widely noted intervention on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was a high-level conference on a two-state solution in July.25 Many diplomats expected this event, which the Assembly had called for in 2024, to fizzle. But it became a lightning rod for international frustration with Israel’s campaign in Gaza. France – followed by the UK, Canada and Malta – announced its intention to recognise bilaterally the State of Palestine, and a number of other member states signalled that they might make the same move. While the Trump administration had lobbied against recognition, and Israel dismissed the conference as rewarding Hamas’s atrocities, it was a reminder that there are still moments when the UN offers a stage for states to take positions of principle that no other multilateral platform can provide (see Section III.1).\nD.What Remains: Retrenchment, Reform and a New Leader\nThe outlook for the UN in the year ahead is bleak. The defining feature will be organisational retrenchment, as the Secretariat and various agencies proceed with trimming budgets and many parts of the UN reduce their global footprints. The human costs of what the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) calls “hyper-prioritising” aid efforts in many conflict settings will be substantial.26 UN aid officials warn that cuts may lead to unrest in recipient countries. Though the correlation between aid distribution and rates of violence is disputed, there is little doubt that the UN’s woes will leave many vulnerable people even further immiserated.27\nThe organisation’s difficulties will also lead to talk of the need for reforms extending beyond immediate retrenchment. Some of these conversations will focus on fine-tuning the organisation’s peace and security tools. Diplomats have been discussing how the UN can do peacebuilding better – with an emphasis on finding new sources of funding, potentially from the international financial institutions – and the Secretariat is working on a review of UN peace operations, particularly “agile” missions.28 But member states like India are liable to point out that the UN also needs more fundamental political reform, such as an overhaul of the Security Council. They may be frustrated, as the Trump administration has shown little interest in such matters, and indicated to some other UN members that it wants to keep the Council structure as it is.29\nThe process of selecting a new Secretary-General is sure to promote more dialogue about the state of the UN.\nThe process of selecting a new Secretary-General is sure to promote more dialogue about the state of the UN. Prior to President Trump’s re-election, the conventional wisdom in New York was that the next UN chief should be a woman (only men have filled the post to date), with a focus on development and climate issues. An informal and non-binding UN convention suggests that it is Latin America’s “turn” to fill the job. As Crisis Group noted a year ago, there is also a need to find a candidate willing and able play a greater role in international mediation than Guterres – a cautious leader playing a dreadful political hand – has been able to do.30\nSince then, the change of U.S. administration has upended some of these assumptions, with several diplomats predicting that Washington will insist on a male Secretary-General to upset liberals at home and abroad.31 It is also clear that candidates, regardless of their gender, will have to talk a good game on cost savings and associated reform issues. While a number of candidates have stuck their heads above the parapet this year – with International Atomic Energy Agency and (IAEA) Director-General Rafael Grossi making most headlines as numerous others ramp up their campaigns – the selection process could run until the last months of 2026.32 All candidates will release manifestos and face public hearings from member states, civil society groups and the press in the first half of next year. This will be an opportunity for all sides to air their views on what sort of reforms the UN must undertake.\nIII.Ten Challenges for the UN\nDespite long-term questions over the future of the UN, it can still play a major role in a wide range of troubled countries. Its means of doing so differ case by case. The following list of challenges covers countries, conflicts and areas of work where the organisation faces notable difficulties or opportunities in the year ahead. The list is necessarily selective and excludes many cases that Crisis Group has highlighted elsewhere. The topics in focus do, however, illustrate various dimensions of UN action that offer a sense of the world organisation’s continuing responsibilities, including humanitarian aid, peacekeeping, peace enforcement and sanctions.\nThe choice of topics also underlines the difficulties involved in selecting what priorities the UN should pursue over the coming months and what to let go. In some cases, our recommendations for dealing with these challenges would be broadly cost-neutral for the UN. In others, we highlight the reasons for the world organisation and its members to scrape together resources in the current period of radical belt-tightening to address specific problems. This raises questions about the trade-offs involved: if the UN funnels more financing to the situations we identify, others are liable to lose out. Readers should not infer that the fact that certain countries and crises do not feature in this publication means that they are less worthy of support. Instead, it is necessary to acknowledge that the UN is struggling to muster resources to cover even those cases that do feature here – and in the current financial climate, UN members and international officials will face unpalatable choices about how to distribute resources both within and between a multitude of pressing crises.\n1. Safeguarding UN Assistance to Palestine\nThe UN has been a direct target of Israel’s nearly two-year war with Hamas in Gaza. Much of what Israel has upended during its campaign – Palestinians’ basic human rights, services to Palestinian refugees in the occupied territories and a diplomatic runway for a two-state solution – rested upon a UN-safeguarded legal and humanitarian framework. This order now lies in tatters. Israel has ignored pressure to halt its offensive and lift its siege of Gaza, resulting in a humanitarian catastrophe.33 The U.S. has unhesitatingly backed Israel, exercising its Security Council veto six times to block calls for a ceasefire since 7 October 2023. Yet even if the UN has not been at the helm of diplomacy to halt the fighting, it is impossible to discuss surges of life-saving assistance or Palestine’s political future without involving the world organisation.\nMass hunger, caused by Israel’s draconian blockage of aid inflows, has afflicted Palestinians in Gaza. In August, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), the UN-affiliated body that makes such determinations, declared famine in parts of the strip, while famine-like conditions had ravaged much of the territory for months beforehand.34 Israel’s decision to disrupt UN aid systems and impose in their place the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation in late May has made food distribution unreliable, chaotic and all too often deadly.35 The UN remains the only organisation with the capacity and experience to deliver aid at adequate scale in Gaza.36\nThe UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), historically the keystone of international assistance to Gaza, faces existential challenges.37 Founded in 1949 to care for Palestinian refugees across the Middle East, the agency has been caught in Israel’s crosshairs. Some 360 UNRWA workers have been killed and over 300 UN installations destroyed since October 2023, “almost entirely as a result of Israeli military operations”.38 Equating the agency with Hamas, Israel has used domestic legislation and defamation campaigns to obstruct its work.39 Many countries – and Palestinians themselves – still hope to save the embattled agency, even as Israel and the U.S. actively work to abolish it.40\nSo long as Israel denies Palestinians the capacity to administer their own affairs, it is vital that UNRWA remain in place.\nA July UN report offers a roadmap for making UNRWA more financially and operationally sustainable.41 It outlines a scenario where responsibility for most services presently offered by UNRWA (such as education and health care) would devolve to the refugee host governments of Jordan, Lebanon and Syria – and eventually to a Palestinian state – while a slimmed-down version of the UN agency would continue safeguarding Palestinian refugees. But this reform can only unfold as part of a discussion about Palestine’s political future, and would require some sort of peace agreement with Israel. So long as Israel denies Palestinians the capacity to administer their own affairs, it is vital that UNRWA remain in place.\nThe French and Saudi-organised Conference on the Two-State Solution in July showed that there also remains space for the UN to assist diplomacy.42 Seven states have announced plans to recognise Palestinian statehood in September, alongside eight others that have already done so since October 2023; 145 UN members currently recognise Palestine as a fellow state.43 More may follow suit ahead of the General Assembly’s high-level week.\nUN members can build on this newfound momentum. First, the General Assembly can serve as a clearinghouse for concrete pledges to apply material pressure on Israel to roll back its control over Palestinians. A September 2024 General Assembly resolution, building on the July 2024 advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice that deemed Israel’s occupation unlawful, lays out legal duties that member states can act upon: abstaining from treaties or trade dealings, withholding military assistance, sanctioning individuals and preventing corporate complicity in illegal Israeli activities in the occupied territories.44\nSecondly, despite Washington’s obstruction of action in the Security Council, the General Assembly can offer a platform for countries to lay the foundations for Palestinian recovery and institution-building. The Arab League’s March plan for Gaza – which was welcomed by the General Assembly in its June resolution, and has been endorsed by the EU, the Organisation of Islamic Countries, China and others – may be a helpful departure point.45\nAs things stand, Arab League members have yet to establish the Steering Committee or reconstruction trust fund outlined in the plan.But Arab countries could work with counterparts in the General Assembly, particularly European states, to establish these structures through the UN, which would offer them more political legitimacy and house them within a formal structure.46 In the medium term, the Steering Committee could serve as the international community’s focal point for advancing the plan’s core provisions.\nAlthough the UN cannot impose changes on the ground without major shifts in Washington’s policies, it remains the best place to foster global consensus on the need to preserve Palestine’s future.\n2. A Surge in Humanitarian Diplomacy for Sudan\nUN efforts to make peace in Sudan are struggling to gain traction more than two years after the country’s civil war began in April 2023. Secretary-General Guterres appointed a personal envoy to the country, Ramtane Lamamra, that November, but he has yet to sustain indirect talks between the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the main belligerents. Nor have efforts by Lamamra and others to forge common ground among the various, mostly stagnant diplomatic initiatives launched by a number Western, Arab and African countries made inroads.47 With little hope at present for its peacemaking pursuits, the UN should focus its diplomacy on addressing the world’s largest humanitarian crisis.\nUnrelenting fighting over the course of over two years has devastated much of Sudan. The UN estimates that nearly 30 million people need international assistance, with one fifth of the country’s pre-war population now displaced by the war. Both the army and RSF have been accused of committing serious human rights violations against civilians, including allegations of sexual violence.48 Since the army retook the capital, Khartoum, in March, the locus of the conflict has shifted west to the Darfur and Kordofan regions. Months earlier, in December 2024, the IPC had already determined that parts of both areas were slipping into famine, and their plight has got worse since.49\nThis catastrophe has received far too little international attention. Appeals for de-escalation and ceasefires, including from the Security Council and the Secretary-General, have gone unheeded.50 Neither the army nor RSF appears likely to negotiate in earnest absent concerted outside pressure. So far, however, that has not been forthcoming, in part because those regional powers with the most influence over the parties – Egypt and Saudi Arabia for the army, and the United Arab Emirates for the RSF – disagree about how to end the war.51 The U.S., which has strong relations with all three of these Arab states, is attempting to corral the group to agree on a path toward a ceasefire, though these efforts have yet to bear fruit.\nIn the absence of unified diplomatic pressure, Sudan’s belligerents have manipulated the humanitarian crisis for their own benefit.\nIn the absence of unified diplomatic pressure, Sudan’s belligerents have manipulated the humanitarian crisis for their own benefit. Port Sudan – where the army has relocated the seat of the UN-recognised government – routinely asserts state sovereignty rights to restrict aid flows into RSF-held territory, though it has recently permitted limited humanitarian access through Adre, close to the Chad border, as a modest concession. For their part, RSF leaders rebuff any international effort that does not treat them and the army generals as political equals.52 The UN’s latest push for a seven-day humanitarian ceasefire in late June fell victim to these tensions.53\nBreaking the impasse between the warring sides will not be easy. The UN should keep trying, but it may be in a better position to lead the international humanitarian response regardless of whether fighting continues or not. First, the Secretary-General could work closely with influential countries like France, Germany, Switzerland and the UK to rally attention to the humanitarian crisis. He should press donors to increase their commitments – the UN’s humanitarian response plan for Sudan is only 22 per cent funded at present – though he will need to summon all his powers of persuasion at a time of massive aid cuts in Washington and worldwide.54\nA reinforced UN response will also require more effective internal coordination. In particular, the organisation’s high-level diplomacy should be better synchronised with the operational requirements of front-line humanitarian agencies like the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and WFP. In June, when the Secretary-General was trying to secure the seven-day ceasefire, aid agencies were sceptical that – were he to succeed – they could deliver the required surge of assistance in such a short time and without prior mobilisation.55 Different parts of the UN system will need to work together more seamlessly so that aid can be trucked rapidly to where it is needed should a similar opportunity arise.\nWith the warring parties establishing parallel governments, and no consensus among major external players on how to end the conflict, Sudan’s war could rage indefinitely. While the UN can stand ready to re-engage with political negotiations if and when they resume, it should not delay in pushing for an improved humanitarian response that gets life-saving assistance to the country’s suffering population.\n3. Resetting the UN’s Approach to Syria\nThe UN has been tentatively recalculating its engagement in Syria since the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad in December 2024. After years of arguing over the Syrian war, with Western countries criticising the deposed regime and Russia backing it, Security Council members are exploring how they can assist the country’s post-Assad transition. Syria’s interim government, headed by President Ahmed al-Sharaa, is pushing for the UN to lift sanctions imposed on its members while they were rebelling against Assad. The Council is divided over this question, but it should resolve the disagreements as soon as possible. It may have only a small window to demonstrate that the UN can be a helpful partner as Syria emerges from war and authoritarian rule.\nThe main sticking point is the inclusion of Syria’s new masters – who formerly belonged to the Islamist group Hei’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), now dissolved – on a UN sanctions list, stemming from their past links with al-Qaeda and ISIS.56 While a July UN report noted “no active ties” between al-Qaeda and HTS, the group, al-Sharaa and Interior Minister Anas Khattab remain sanctioned even as the U.S. and EU have lifted their own measures.57 These sanctions discourage aid agencies and international financial institutions from engaging with Damascus, impeding the country’s prospects for economic recovery.\nThe U.S. circulated a draft Security Council resolution in Juneproposing to delist HTS, al-Sharaa and Khattab, as well as create sanctions exemptions that would facilitate transactions for governmental purposes and the work of the IAEA, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, and demining groups. While most Council members support these steps, some are urging a more gradualapproach, based on specific conditions being met. China is worried about the role of Uighur fighters, including from the Turkistan Islamic Party (a faction that fought the Assad regime alongside the former HTS), who are now being incorporated into the new Syrian army. Russia for its part indicated scepticism about rapidly delisting HTS members given concerns over the presence of Central Asian and Chechnyan fighters (though on a much smaller scale than the Uighurs). France is also hesitant to move too quickly to delist and lose the Council’s leverage over Damascus.\nRecognising these concerns, the U.S. has dropped its proposal to delist HTS from the draft resolution.58 But the interim authorities and UN leadership are pressing the Council to reach a deal on this issue as soon as possible. Should they fail to agree on removing all sanctions, Council members could alternatively map a route to incremental relief.\nSeparately, the UN Secretariat has begun looking into how to offer more direct support to Syria’s political transition.59 The interim authorities were reluctant at first to deal with the UN special envoy as they felt that parts of the UN had been too cooperative with the old regime. But they are now more open to engagement with the UN, and countries in the nearby region have also helped them appreciate the legitimacy that it brings as they face the enormous challenges of rebuilding the Syrian state. A UN team spent much of the spring brainstorming with a cross-section of Syrian society about the way forward. Further discussions among the UN, the interim authorities and the Security Council will pick up toward the end of the year.\n[Relocating the special envoy’s office from Geneva to Damascus] would bolster the UN’s credibility and access to Syrians inside and outside government.\nIn the meantime, the Secretary-General can take several steps. He is widely expected to relocate the special envoy’s office from Geneva – where it has sat since 2012 – to Damascus. This move would bolster the UN’s credibility and access to Syrians inside and outside government. More important changes – such as transforming the envoy’s office into a full-fledged political mission – would require a new Security Council mandate. Council members should work closely with the interim authorities to draft the job description for a new mission that would offer technical advice on the transition, governance, and other matters.\nSuch a mission could support the government’s nascent efforts to promote national cohesion. In a country riven by deep mistrust, the UN could help the interim authorities bridge gaps between their efforts to consolidate control of the state and ethnic and religious minorities’ demands for protection and inclusion. This divide has grown wider following a series of violent outbreaks in predominantly minority areas along the coast of Syria and in Sweida governorate.60Similarly, a new UN mission could help amplify the concerns of women-led civil society organisations that are advocating for greater representation and participation in Syria’s new political structures.\nThe Security Council can no longer put off hard choices about its engagement with Damascus, as it risks squandering what could be a passing moment of good-will. Having fallen short of Syrians’ expectations for over a decade, the UN should not let its present opportunity go to waste.\n4. Reviving International Assistance to Haiti\nA year ago, Security Council members hoped that the arrival of the Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission would help the Haitian authorities stop a spiral of gang violence. But security has only deteriorated in the country since the Kenya-led mission deployed in June 2024: armed gangs are active in around 90 per cent of the capital Port-au-Prince, and they control vital economic routes to the north, south and east.61 They stage regular, coordinated attacks on state forces and MSS personnel alike. Haiti’s transitional government is rapidly approaching the end of its term in February 2026, but it is no closer to achieving stability.62\nNow, the future of the MSS is in doubt. Until very recently, the Haitian government and its partners worried about securing additional troops and the infusion of cash it needed to be able to operate into 2026.63 In late August, however, the U.S. surprised UN diplomats with a proposal to transform the MSS into a “Gang-Suppression Force” (GSF), authorised by the Security Council but led and overseen by a group of countries from the region – the U.S., Canada, El Salvador, Guatemala, Jamaica, Kenya, and the Bahamas – and partly funded through a UN logistics support package.64\nThis is a radical shift, as the U.S. had been the MSS’s chief proponent. The Biden and Trump administrations contributed over $800 million to its startup and operations from October 2023 onwards.65 In the second half of 2024, sensing reluctance in Congress to sustain this assistance, U.S. diplomats pushed to transform the mission into a UN peacekeeping operation.66 Their appeals to the Security Council and the Secretariat fell flat, however, due to scepticism about sending blue helmets into active combat. Instead, the Secretary-General recommended that the Council bolster the MSS with a UN-funded logistics package involving operational, material, and administrative support, coordinated by a new UN office in Haiti and paid through the UN’s peacekeeping budget.67\nWashington’s proposal envisions over 5,500 troops conducting kinetic anti-gang operations independently from, and alongside, the Haitian police.\nPresident Trump came back to office with a new approach to Haiti, which initially stressed bilateral sanctions on the gangs and burden sharing through the Organisation of American States (OAS).68 After months of slow-walking discussions in the Security Council, it circulated last month a draft resolution that would upend international security assistance to Haiti. Washington’s proposal envisions over 5,500 troops conducting kinetic anti-gang operations independently from, and alongside, the Haitian police.69 The proposal is an explicit recognition that the scale of Haiti’s security challenges far exceeds what the MSS can realistically offer, but it is likely to arouse scepticism from Council members who question its viability and outright opposition from Russia and China, who have argued against international interventions in the country.\nEven if Washington secures the Council’s backing for the proposal, diplomats will need to clarify important details to give this operation any chance to succeed. Although it would not be a UN-led mission, the GSF should be designed with explicit mechanisms for UN oversight and accountability, as well as robust coordination channels between Haitian authorities, the UN and the proposed force. Council members should also have a clear understanding of which countries are prepared to contribute funds before endorsing any mandate, as the GSF’s reliance on voluntary contributions of money to pay for troop stipends could hinder its operations – just as has happened with the MSS. Haitian political leaders and civil society will also need to play a prominent part in shaping the rollout of any new force, as many remain wary of international interventions led by former colonial powers.\nAs diplomats turn their attention to the future of the MSS, the UN political office in Haiti (BINUH) can play a significant role in keeping international attention on the country’s political transition. A constitutional referendum and elections are now due by February 2026 despite the widespread insecurity and infighting among the Haitian elite. The UN has been marginal in national political debates since the transitional authorities took office in April 2024. But with the UN conducting an internal review of the mission, the newly appointed head of BINUH has an opportunity to push for a new outlook.70\nAbove all, BINUH should help mitigate the extreme polarisation that characterises Haitian politics so the country can establish a coordinated security strategy.71 The office should also improve relations with the Caribbean Community Eminent Persons Group and the Secretary-General of the OAS, so that all three multilateral institutions can send common messages and pool resources.\nHaitians need improved security and effective government to stop the deadly cycle of conflict in their country. In spite of its current limitations, the UN is one of the few institutions with the diplomatic capacity and know-how to help. The organisation and its members should urgently revive international assistance that is on the verge of flatlining.\n5. Updating Sanctions on the Afghan Taliban\nSince the Taliban seized Kabul in 2021, the Security Council and UN system have struggled with how to deal with the de facto authorities in Afghanistan. At first, Council members agreed that the Taliban should remain isolated and unrecognised. This view no longer enjoys consensus. A 2023 review commissioned by the Council proposed a pathway to recognition and sanctions relief, in return for regime pledges to respect women’s rights and other international obligations.72 But talks in Doha between the Taliban and UN have made little progress, and many UN members still see the Taliban as pariahs due to their draconian restrictions on the rights of women and girls. Others, notably China and Russia, have nurtured diplomatic ties with Kabul. Russia became the first country to recognise the de facto authorities in July.73\nDespite these divisions, the Council could try adjusting the UN sanctions regime against the Taliban – comprising an arms embargo, travel bans and asset freezes on individuals and entities associated with the group – to nudge them toward modest changes in their behaviour. The sanctions regime has not been updated in a decade. The 2015 resolution (2255) contains many anachronisms, including a clause urging member states to consult offices of the former Afghan government, which has been defunct for more than four years. Any entity that supports the group’s “acts and activities” is currently eligible for penalties – an unrealistic bar now that the Taliban run the country.\nAn updated sanctions regime could be a huge incentive in future negotiations with the Taliban.\nAn updated sanctions regime could be a huge incentive in future negotiations with the Taliban. The UN Mission in Afghanistan has recently proposed a six-part “mosaic” approach to jump-starting talks between the de facto authorities and outside parties. The plan includes engagement on sanctions reform, unfreezing assets of the Afghan central bank and restoring diplomatic representation in exchange for progress by the Taliban on counter-terrorism, inclusive governance and women’s rights. Sanctions reform is the most urgent of these steps for the Taliban, and the one most likely to generate concessions from them. Taliban leaders tend to view the persistent sanctions as a form of economic warfare, and they have repeatedly asked UN officials about the potential conditions for lifting the restrictions.74\nThe mere existence of the sanctions has a chilling effect on humanitarian and economic activities in Afghanistan.75 U.S. sanctions are more prohibitive than UN sanctions, but the latter still pose challenges. In 2021, the Council passed Resolution 2615, which states that financing humanitarian activities in Afghanistan does not violate UN sanctions. Even so, humanitarian and financial institutions continue to approach the country with great care. The private sector has a low risk tolerance when it comes to Afghanistan; the cost of running afoul of the sanctions regime, even if unintentionally, often outweighs the benefit of engagement. Other concerns, such as the general reputational harm of associating with the Taliban, and confusion about what the sanctions permit, have also contributed to decisions to stay out of Afghanistan despite the dire humanitarian situation; 75 per cent of Afghans struggle to meet daily needs.76\nThe Security Council could clarify the scope of UN sanctions and try to increase their leverage over the Taliban by updating the regime. Changing out-of-date language is a logical first step. The Council could also consider adding benchmarks with a clear quid pro quo. In other cases, it has coaxed governments into cooperating by proposing certain benchmarks that would qualify for sanctions relief once they are met.77 In the Afghan case, options would include setting clear counter-terrorism goals for the de facto authorities, such as preventing transnational jihadist groups from using Afghan soil as a base of operations or loosening constraints on the rights of women and girls. Instituting a periodic review of the sanctions – a mechanism that exists in the UN regime covering al-Qaeda and ISIS – could help build confidence in Kabul that concessions will have a reward.\nIn practical terms, easing UN sanctions on the Taliban will have a limited economic impact as long as U.S. restrictions remain in place. But if powerful Council members can put aside their divergent views on how to deal with Kabul, and back a common roadmap for improving relations, it could offer the UN a belated diplomatic opportunity to influence Afghanistan’s trajectory.\n6. Adjusting MONUSCO’s Role in the Eastern DRC\nThe Security Council will vote in December on a new mandate for MONUSCO, the blue-helmet mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), nearly a year after Rwandan-backed M23 rebels captured the capitals of the North Kivu and South Kivu provinces.78 Despite Rwanda and the M23 committing to respect the DRC’s sovereignty as part of recent peace deals, they are bedding down for a long-term occupation. This poses numerous problems for MONUSCO as it must operate in areas that are under the M23’s de facto control. Nevertheless, the UN still has a role in the eastern DRC, especially if the parties finally comply with a long-promised ceasefire. Council members should be prepared to quickly reposition MONUSCO to support any truce that may emerge.\nThe mission’s failure to stop the M23’s advance worsened its reputation among ordinary Congolese, while the violence soured already frosty relations between the force and the M23 rebels. During fighting for Goma, all sides engaged in sexual violence and forced recruitment of children. UN peacekeepers, tasked with protecting civilians in conflict zones, could not halt widespread abuses, despite having the authority to conduct offensive operations in precisely such cases.79 Today, movement restrictions imposed by the M23 on UN personnel in North Kivu’s capital Goma and surrounds continue to hamstring the mission.80\nDividing lines between rebels and the army have shifted little in recent months. Combined with the parties’ commitments on paper to a ceasefire, this may give the peacekeeping operation new purpose. The 27 June Washington Agreement between the Congolese and Rwandan governments, along with the 19 July declaration of principles negotiated separately in Doha by Kinshasa and the M23, commit the parties to a permanent ceasefire, the protection of civilians, the return of displaced populations and the restoration of state authority in the eastern DRC.81 Some of these elements, especially restoration of state authority, reflect negotiating terms but have little bearing in areas under M23 control. But the commitment to a ceasefire is vital and MONUSCO, though excluded from previous negotiations, could help the belligerents fulfil its terms.82 UN peacekeepers have decades of experience observing ceasefires, including in the DRC during the early 2000s.83 The Security Council broached this idea in February, and UN officials have already outlined possible requirements.84\nSecurity Council members could think about three main forms of ceasefire assistance. One could entail a boosted presence around Uvira, where frontline fighting is most active, provided that diplomatic pressure helps tamp down the current hostilities. This would require MONUSCO to redeploy to South Kivu after withdrawing from the province in June 2024; although the Congolese government had pressured the blue helmet mission into leaving, its recent military defeats could make the prospects of their return more palatable to Kinshasa. A second prospect could involve the mission widening its footprint around hotspots in North Kivu, where the M23 and Rwandan troops clash with pro-Kinshasa Wazalendo militias, Rwandan rebels and other armed groups.85 A third could see UN peacekeepers expand activities in Ituri province, where they protect over a million people fleeing fighting from local armed groups.86\nSuccessful ceasefire monitoring would require commitment from the parties, the mission, troop-contributing countries and the Security Council. It would also require additional resources, as peacekeepers would need advanced reconnaissance technologies to conduct real-time monitoring.\nConsistent messaging from the Security Council, combined with direct pressure from Doha and Washington … would give MONUSCO the political backing it needs.\nThe politics will be, as ever, hard to navigate. MONUSCO needs to safeguard its impartiality without compromising its protection responsibilities. Rwanda and the M23 have clashed with blue helmets for nearly four years and engaged in fierce exchanges of fire before Goma fell.87 For Kinshasa, on whose consent the mission depends, the M23 are a foreign-backed terrorist force. Cooperating with rebels in order to ensure access, while avoiding accusations of cementing the annexation of Congolese territory, is already a major headache for MONUSCO’s leadership. Consistent messaging from the Security Council, combined with direct pressure from Doha and Washington on Kinshasa and Kigali, would give MONUSCO the political backing it needs as it balances different components of its mandate.\nThe mission’s exact role will depend on how far the parties comply with their commitments, or, conversely, how much the fighting continues. Nevertheless, international pressure on the parties remains relatively high in the wake of the Washington deal: the UN can play an active role in monitoring a ceasefire in areas where it more or less holds, in the hopes that such areas expand over time.\n7. Refocusing Attention on the Rohingya Refugee Crisis\nThe plight of Rohingya Muslim refugees from Myanmar in Bangladesh remains one of the largest humanitarian crises facing the UN. Close to a million Rohingya have fled northern Rakhine State since Myanmar’s military launched a campaign of ethnic cleansing against the religious minority in 2017. While the Bangladeshi government has facilitated basic assistance for these refugees, it has resisted integrating them into the local economy, insisting despite much evidence to the contrary that repatriation is near. Aid cuts are worsening their lot; the UN has warned that without additional pledges, funding for food assistance will run out by December.88\nBangladesh has pressed for greater international support, and on 30 September UN members will hold a special high-level conference in New York on the Rohingya crisis.89 While this gathering will cover both the situation in Myanmar’s Rakhine State and questions related to the humanitarian response across the border, participants should also focus on another dimension of the crisis: insecurity in the refugee camps in Bangladesh, caused partly by increasingly unified Rohingya armed groups, which are enlisting refugees into their ranks and mounting a growing number of violent cross-border incursions into Rakhine.\nThe situation is complicated by security and political developments on both sides of the border. In Myanmar, the Arakan Army – an ethnic armed group backed by the local Buddhist majority – has seized control of most of Rakhine State in the wake of the 2021 coup. Fighting through 2024 pitted the Arakan Army against Rohingya armed groups, which sided with the Myanmar military; the Arakan Army has since been accused of atrocities against Rohingya civilians, and there has been a fresh influx of refugees into Bangladesh.90 In the refugee camps, Rohingya armed groups have responded by suspending long-running turf wars and carrying out recruitment campaigns. The Bangladeshi security services seem to have tolerated these activities, with the apparent goal of using the armed groups as a negotiating tool to push the Arakan Army to cooperate on refugee repatriation.91 The armed groups have also launched raids on Rakhine State targeting both the Arakan Army and civilians, helping perpetuate a cycle of violent friction between the state’s Buddhist and Muslim communities.\nThough many in Bangladesh are aware of the security challenges in the camps, the country’s transitional leadership ... is struggling to respond effectively.\nThough many in Bangladesh are aware of the security challenges in the camps, the country’s transitional leadership – preoccupied with the fallout from Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s overthrow in August 2024 – is struggling to respond effectively. While Bangladesh will understandably use the forthcoming UN conference to highlight the need for sustained humanitarian funding and a plan for repatriation, other participants should seize the opportunity to flag concerns about growing Rohingya militancy with senior Bangladeshi officials, albeit discreetly so as to avoid any backlash.\nThe UN and foreign governments lack the authority or the ability to intervene directly in the camps, but they can work with the Bangladeshi authorities to curb the armed groups’ appeal to refugees. One reason that young men in particular are drawn to the groups is a lack of other livelihood options. The government bars refugees from getting jobs or launching small businesses, though in practice many do both.92 Providing the refugees with more livelihood opportunities that prepare them for repatriation, reduce aid dependence and support the local economy, while taking further steps to improve their living conditions – such as raising the quality of shelters and available education and health care – would give them alternatives to joining armed groups and help them navigate the effects of declining international aid. Some of this assistance would be contingent on additional financial support.\nOfficials in Dhaka will reasonably worry that such steps could result in many Rohingya refugees settling down on Bangladeshi soil. But the alternative is enabling armed groups to gain further power, allowing them both to impose themselves in the camps and ratchet up clashes with the Arakan Army.\n8. Meeting Sexual and Reproductive Health Needs in Conflict Settings\nAs budget cuts upend the UN system, sexual and reproductive health services in conflict zones are at particular risk. Prior to the Trump administration’s dismantling of USAID, the U.S. was the largest contributor to international health care providers, with UN agencies among the main recipients. The withdrawal of U.S. funds, alongside cuts by the UK, Belgium and others, has left the global health sector in tatters. The reduction of health services from UN agencies in conflict-affected countries is creating ever larger challenges – and becoming ever more costly to reverse – while the need for sexual and reproductive health care in conflict settings is on a relentless rise.93\nTake Sudan, where evidence of large-scale sexual violence continues to emerge and survivors’ needs remain largely unmet.94 UN officials told Crisis Group that aid cuts have forced the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) to close 40 safe spaces that provided medical treatment and counselling for rape survivors, including in battlegrounds like El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur province, where sexual violence is rife.95 In Afghanistan, where Taliban edicts had already complicated access to maternal health services, 409 midwives will lose UNFPA support in 2025 due to aid cuts.96 With famine stalking Gaza, UNFPA’s appeal for life-saving assistance for mothers and newborns had raised less than 13 per cent of the necessary funds as of April.97\nUNFPA has faced reductions in funding during all the U.S. Republican presidencies since Ronald Reagan’s, but this time cuts were accompanied by a stop-work order that clawed back committed and partially spent funds that had been allocated under the Biden administration.98 Further complicating the funding panorama, other donors are not stepping in this time, as aid is being trimmed more broadly while the global conservative clamour against providing sexual and reproductive health care has reached a volume not heard in recent decades.99\nAid cuts have … revealed structural weaknesses in how sexual and reproductive health needs in conflict were being met.\nAid cuts have also revealed structural weaknesses in how sexual and reproductive health needs in conflict were being met. UN representatives told Crisis Group that the high level of international contributions enabled national governments to rely on external partners and masked low internal investment in national health systems. As aid cuts sever parts of the supply chain for health care, the effects of this dependence have started to show. Warehouses are full of wasting HIV/AIDS treatments in Cameroon and post-rape kits in the DRC, while the U.S. makes proactive efforts to destroy millions of dollars of contraceptives stuck in storage in Europe rather than allow the UN and others to purchase them.100 Meanwhile, the interruption of the U.S.-supported Demographic and Health Surveys has created a major gap in knowledge of populations’ medical needs and thwarted data-driven analysis of the impact of the aid cuts.\nTo limit additional harm, donors should ringfence their remaining support for sexual and reproductive health services when making aid cuts, as the Netherlands and Sweden have done. Cuts to areas like contraception in particular are likely to cause a long-term strain on the global humanitarian system’s operations in conflict-affected societies, as decreased access to prophylactics will lead to a rise in births and increasing basic needs in a growing population.\nDonors and the UN should also intensify UN efforts to address the shortcomings in national healthcare systems by directing scarce funds toward boosting lasting capabilities. Among these, occupations such as midwifery are particularly important because they offer ways to fulfil basic sexual and reproductive health care needs such as safe births at relatively low cost.101 Such services can then be managed by national health systems themselves over the longer term, reducing the reliance on volatile external support. But building national health systems will not be quick or simple, so international partners should ideally continue their support for the most essential sexual and reproductive care programs in the interim.\n9. Managing the Fallout of Snapback Sanctions on Iran\nA struggle is under way in the Security Council over UN sanctions on Iran. When Iran and world powers agreed to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in 2015, the Security Council suspended a raft of sanctions against Tehran related to its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.102 The Council said the JCPOA signatories could reimpose those measures if Iran had failed to comply with the deal’s terms and all other dispute resolution mechanisms had been exhausted. On 28 August, Britain, France and Germany (the JCPOA’s European signatories, known as the E3) triggered this option, known as snapback, claiming that Iran has been breaching its non-proliferation commitments since 2019 to the extent of “significant non-performance”.103\nAccording to the snapback process, which was designed to bypass Chinese and Russian vetoes, the sanctions will come back into force unless the Council passes a resolution reaffirming their suspension within 30 days.104 Britain, France or the U.S. can use their own vetoes to block any such resolution. The upshot is that – absent a last-minute deal with Iran – the Western powers will declare that sanctions come back into force on midnight of 28 September.105 The wide-ranging measures include prohibitions on trading in nuclear materials and many types of conventional weapons with Iran.\nThe E3 have been dangling the prospect of snapback throughout this year, in part because Security Council Resolution 2231 endorsing the JCPOA is set to expire on 18 October. The U.S. – which attempted to trigger the process in 2020 but was largely ignored due to President Trump’s 2018 decision to exit the JCPOA – has supported the initiative.106 After the Israeli and U.S. strikes on Iran in June, the E3 tried to persuade Iran to agree to a six-month extension of the snapback option’s end date, to buy time for further talks on a new nuclear agreement and a restoration of suspended UN access to its facilities.107 Iran has, however, refused to contemplate European conditions and any extension, and slow-pedalled talks.\nIran has threatened to leave the Non-Proliferation Treaty in response to snap-back [sanctions].\nWhile the sanctions resolutions the E3 wish to restore are supposedly binding on all UN members, it is not clear that powers including China and Russia will accept them. Like Tehran, Moscow has argued that the E3 are no longer in compliance with the JCPOA, having failed to deliver on economic commitments to Iran.108 Though Russia and China have no obvious way to stymie snapback, they can complicate it by blocking creation of a Security Council committee to oversee the sanctions regime and a panel of experts to monitor states’ interactions with Iran. Beyond New York, the U.S. and European powers and may compete with Russia and China to persuade other countries that the snapback process was legitimate or illegitimate, respectively. European diplomats also concede that – whatever the legal merits – enforcement of renewed sanctions may prove patchy. Iran has threatened to leave the Non-Proliferation Treaty in response to snapback, though as of writing has yet to implement a formal riposte following the E3 notification.109\nEven while triggering snapback, the E3 – as well as Washington – have underscored their willingness to use the weeks before the restoration of sanctions to pursue a diplomatic agreement. Neither they – nor Tehran – should give up on the hunt for a negotiated solution to the nuclear issue. Forsaking future talks could spur Iran into racing for a nuclear weapon. With UN inspectors unable to monitor what nuclear activities are under way inside the country, the risks of an eventual resumption of Israeli and or American attacks against Iran would seem unavoidable in this scenario.\nAn alternative to resurgent conflict exists. As Crisis Group has argued, the U.S. and its allies could aim to reframe the problem by proposing that Iran enter a multinational consortium of states to enrich uranium for civilian purposes – which Tehran insists is its right – and negotiate a non-aggression pledge with Israel.110 Should Iran take steps in this direction, the Security Council would likely be involved in endorsing any measures and the UN’s nuclear watchdog in verifying Iranian compliance.\n10. Scoping a Potential Role for the UN in Ukraine\nIn early 2025, the Trump administration’s push for a quick ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine stirred backroom discussions in New York as to what the UN could do to help. These lost momentum as the prospect of a speedy end to hostilities has dimmed. Following the August meeting between President Trump and President Vladimir Putin in Alaska – and Trump’s subsequent gathering with the Ukrainian and other European heads of state at the White House – the question of what role the UN can play in Ukraine could be up for debate.111\nFrom 2022 to 2024, discussions on the Security Council of Russia’s all-out aggression fell into a predictable pattern, with Ukraine’s allies and Russia trading barbs in frequent but unproductive meetings. In the General Assembly, a majority of member states voted for resolutions in support of Ukraine in the war’s first year, but the consensus frayed as a growing number of countries from the so-called Global South argued that the UN should focus more on their concerns, such as debt and development, and the Israel-Hamas conflict took over the agenda.112\nAs noted above, the Trump administration shook up UN debates in February by opposing a Ukrainian- and European-drafted Assembly resolution marking the war’s third anniversary and tabling an alternative in the Security Council calling for an early peace (a text that Russia supported while France and the UK abstained). But the U.S. initiative also spurred discussion of what part, if any, the UN could have in monitoring a potential ceasefire. While the UK and France led talks on a potential post-conflict European military deployment to Ukraine, both the U.S. and several other NATO states acknowledged that a separate international verification mission – with a Security Council mandate and possibly under UN command – might be needed to oversee a ceasefire line and help tamp down unintended flare-ups.113 France appears to have been one of a number of states to have raised this topic with Secretary-General Guterres.114\nPrior to 2025, the UN had done no planning for any sort of peace operation in Ukraine. The Secretary-General has been wary of engaging in diplomatic initiatives around ending hostilities, in part because he did not want to seem to endorse a settlement involving Kyiv ceding territory. There have been more discussions in the Secretariat, but not at a great level of detail (more substantive ones have taken place at think-tanks focused on peacekeeping).115\nEven though a settlement [of the war in Ukraine] is not yet in view, UN officials and diplomats need to think through various contingencies for the UN.\nEven though a settlement is not yet in view, UN officials and diplomats need to think through various contingencies for the UN. As Crisis Group has noted, the contours of a plausible deal have become clearer throughout on-and-off diplomacy, and it is hard to imagine a sustainable settlement without an outside body – possibly the UN – overseeing the line of contact between the two sides.116 Even if this is still a hypothetical and remote outcome, UN officials could use such scenarios as starting points for planning.\nThe Security Council could also help oversee any international presence on Ukrainian soil, and the UN itself could have a direct operational role in facilitating an end to hostilities. UN-sponsored bodies could monitor the front line, for instance, as well as backstop exchanges of prisoners, help with demining and coordinate the return of civilians including children. Some of these tasks – such as monitoring – might require the deployment of UN personnel, while others would fall to UN humanitarian agencies already active in Ukraine, though the latter have seen financing for their work in the country take a hit.\nIV.Conclusion\nFor many UN members and international officials, the main goal for the world organisation in the next twelve months will simply be muddling through. It will be a relief if the Secretariat and agencies can stabilise their finances. Secretary-General Guterres will move from outlining the UN80 reform process to making those specific cuts and changes he can manage during his final term in office. While the coming year may not bring much comfort for the UN, it may offer some clarity about the organisation’s future. If and when senior U.S. political appointees arrive in New York, Geneva and other UN centres, they may offer other representatives a better sense of how the Trump administration will engage diplomatically. The process of selecting a new Secretary-General will be an opportunity for UN members to indicate their preferences about the organisation’s priorities. The coming year may thus be a transitional period, as the institution adapts to its reduced circumstances and policymakers mull reforms for whomever succeeds Guterres.\nYet the UN faces problems that cannot wait. The window to gain a foothold in Syria will not stay open for long, and it is well past time for the Security Council to recalibrate its stance toward Afghanistan. The humanitarian emergencies in Gaza and Sudan demand immediate attention, as does the security crisis in Haiti. Conflicts including that between Russia and Ukraine will evolve at speed, with uncertain results. Moreover, allowing further rollback of standards on gender equality that have taken decades to achieve will increase the suffering and harm the life chances of women and girls in conflict zones around the world.\nUN officials often talk about the need to get ahead of emerging challenges rather than react to them. They rarely do so. But as this briefing has shown, there are a range of crises facing the UN that – despite ill geopolitical and financial omens – require rapid action, even if the cash to do so and easy solutions are in short supply. The dominant emotion at the UN in 2025 has been self-pity. Despite the headwinds, the organisation should not forget what it can still achieve.",
        "At the UN, African leaders did not draw attention to home conflicts, analysts say. At the UN, African leaders did not draw attention to home conflicts, analysts say\nThey had a lot to say about global affairs\nLAGOS, Nigeria -- They had a lot to say about global affairs. But complicated things happening closer to home? Not so much.\nLike their counterparts from other continents, African leaders took to the United Nations podium over the past week to address the U.N. General Assembly on pressing global issues, including climate change, inequality and the spread of conflict.\nAfrican leaders — including Nigerian Vice President Kassim Shettima, Senegalese President Bassirou Faye and Namibian President Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah — spoke vehemently about global conflicts and called for an end to Israel's attacks on Gaza.\n“The people of Palestine are not collateral damage in a civilization that is searching for order. They are human beings, equal in worth, entitled to the same freedoms and dignities that the rest of us take for granted,” Shettima said last week.\nHowever, analysts say two of Africa’s most complicated conflicts in Sudan and Congo, which have killed thousands of people and both reached an impasse, were given barely any significant airtime by African leaders.\n“African countries have sort of stepped back to some extent in terms of wanting to place African issues at the forefront of the U.N. agenda,” said Chris Ogunmodede, an Africa affairs analyst with experience working in African diplomatic circles. “On the most important dates on the U.N. calendar, there is nothing to say about African issues in any substantive way.”\nWar in Sudan, the world's biggest humanitarian crisis, broke out in mid-2023 when a paramilitary outfit launched an assault on the central African country’s armed forces, both of which had ruled together for years. The conflict rapidly descended into a full-blown civil war, which has now effectively partitioned the country into two and has killed at least 40,000 people.\nThe army regained control of the capital in a watershed moment in the war and pushed the rebel group Rapid Support Forces mainly to Darfur, the western region of the country.\nThe U.N. has accused both sides of mass atrocities and warned of famine in parts of Sudan, as both groups have imposed restrictions on food and aid distribution as the fight continues. A drone strike earlier this month killed at least 70 people in besieged El-Fasher.\nIn January, the M23 rebel group, backed by Rwanda, launched a blitz of attacks in the eastern region of Congo and rapidly took key cities. The conflict has since killed roughly 7,000 people, with millions of others displaced or trapped in rebel-held cities.\nAccording to the U.N., over 100 rebel groups are fighting in the mineral-rich eastern region of the Congo. A Doha peace initiative reached a deal between Congo and the M23 group, but fighting has continued.\n“The cursory mentions of DR Congo and Sudan were a missed opportunity by African leaders to really highlight how pronounced the humanitarian crises have become,” said Beverly Ochieng, a senior security analyst at Control Risks.\nThe General Assembly speeches, analysts say, demonstrate the lack of interest from African leaders in solving these conflicts. They also reflect institutional problems with the continent's own multilateral organizations, where African leaders are absent at the negotiating tables.\n“We are seeing the reality of the limitations of African institutions and states, the limitations of their own ability to pursue their own international affairs,” Ogunmodede said.\nLeading negotiations for conflicts are external powers, some of whom have been accused of being a party to the conflicts. This week on the U.N. sidelines, a group of diplomatic leaders from the U.S., the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Egypt ramp up efforts to end the war in Sudan. A Washington-led peace deal between Congo and Rwanda is expected to be signed in the coming weeks.\nSince both wars broke out, they have quickly taken on complex geopolitical dynamics with various competing powers. The U.N. said Rwanda backs the M23 rebel group in Congo, and the conflict has also pulled in neighboring countries like Burundi and Uganda.\nIn March, Sudanese armed forces filed a case to the U.N. top court against the UAE, accusing it of arming its major adversary and breaching the genocide convention. The UAE denies supporting the allegations.\n“The outside interests have leverage, and that compels armed actors to deal with peace mechanism coming from outside,\" Ochieng said. “With African institutions, they do not have as much leverage institutionally or being able to provide additional incentives for peace and security initiatives.\"\nSponsored Content by Taboola\nPopular Reads\nABC News Live\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

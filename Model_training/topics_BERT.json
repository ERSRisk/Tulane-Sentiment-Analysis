Now, that program is at risk. As a teen, Sparks knew he wanted to go to college and become a teacher. But growing up in rural Kentucky in a low-income household without role models who had attended college, he didn\u2019t know where to start. He found the help he needed in the Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP) initiative. Through the program, Sparks connected with mentors who helped him learn about financial aid, how to fill out a FAFSA form and how to look through a college course catalog. States, colleges, school districts and community organizations apply for federal money to support this work with students like him each year. Sparks graduated from high school \u2014 something his grandfather, who helped raise him, never did \u2014 attended college and went on to earn multiple graduate degrees, including his doctoral degree. \u201cThere\u2019s almost an unofficial playbook about how to make it through college financially, academically \u2014 all these things,\u201d said Sparks, who now teaches statistics at the University of California, Los Angeles and helps young Kentuckians find their path toward higher education. \u201cAnd without those resources, I had no idea about how to make that happen.\u201d Nationwide, more than 568,000 low-income students were enrolled in the GEAR UP program in the 2022-23 school year, according to the National Council for Community and Education Partnerships. But under the Trump administration\u2019s 2026 proposed budget for the Department of Education, this program would be eliminated. \u201c\u201cThe GEAR Up Program has accomplished what it set out to do \u2013 help students prepare and enroll in college,\u201d said Ellen Keast, a Department of Education spokesperson, in a written statement to PBS News. \u201cThrough access to federal student aid, states and institutions of higher education have the ability to continue these programs.\u201d The Department of Education distributes grants and loans like GEAR UP to the nation\u2019s schools and students for a wide variety of support programs, for elementary to college students and beyond. But the department has become a target for the Trump administration\u2019s goal of slimming the federal government. In March, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to eliminate the U.S. Department of Education. Nearly 2,000 employees were laid off that month, including those responsible for fielding complaints about federal student loans, training state and district officials on how to secure and comply with competitive federal grants, and monitoring data for trends in graduation rates and student need nationwide. On Thursday, a federal judge blocked Trump\u2019s order with a preliminary injunction following a lawsuit filed in Massachusetts by multiple school districts and education groups, U.S. District Judge Myong Joun ordered the federal agency to reinstate its fired workers. A department spokesperson told PBS News that the administration plans to immediately challenge the judge\u2019s ruling. \u201cPresident Trump and the Senate-confirmed Secretary of Education clearly have the authority to make decisions about agency reorganization efforts, not an unelected Judge with a political axe to grind. This ruling is not in the best interest of American students or families,\u201d Madi Biedermann, deputy assistant secretary for communications at the Department of Education, said in a written statement. Some workers who have been fired outright or have been placed on administrative leave say the cuts make it harder to ensure taxpayer dollars are spent on education in the ways Congress intended and will make it harder for local communities and states to support students or plan for the future. Education research scientist Joseph Murphy was on a team of six people that tracked data tied to federal grants designed to help the nation\u2019s students and communities with the highest needs. They collected and analyzed data from all U.S. states and territories and assisted with quality control, making sure services, such as how many elementary students needed an aide to help them read, were counted the same way across the country. Murphy sees the elimination of his team as \u201ca complete purge of anything data-related.\u201d \u201cThis is an open war on data \u2013 on anybody who has truth and facts and figures to back up what they\u2019re saying, to prove the folks that were saying that the education system is a mess, to prove them wrong,\u201d he said. People do not really understand what the federal government does and what cuts to the Education Department or its services mean, Murphy said. Different states and school districts rely on federal dollars by varying degrees. For decades, the government has relied on data to determine where needs are greatest and if those dollars generated results. Murphy is unsure whether that data can be collected for the upcoming academic year or if anyone will be in place to understand and evaluate it. Without reliable data to track federal funding and their associated outcomes, Murphy does not know how those decisions will be made \u2014 if at all. Taken together, Donald Moynihan, a professor at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ford School of Public Policy, said these changes will erode the ability to determine how the nation overall is performing in the classroom, what should be done differently and how to reach those goals. \u201cPresident Trump and his supporters do not think we should have a national vision for education, that there shouldn\u2019t be a body that\u2019s empowered to do things like collect data on performance of students,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018Increasingly, we end up flying blind.\u201d What the Education Department does The Department of Education became a Cabinet-level department in 1979. For decades, Congress has passed laws to govern how those dollars would be distributed to communities. Moynihan said while the department does not provide teachers, it sets standards and collects data to track if those standards are being met across the country, monitoring for disparities. \u201cWhile regulations can be cumbersome, they\u2019re there to make sure people\u2019s tax dollars are used according to the will of Congress and that everyone is a good steward,\u201d said David Downey, a former management analyst at the department who trained more than 100,000 people on how to apply for and manage federal grants, including the GEAR UP program. Since the Reagan administration, presidents have threatened to get rid of the Department of Education, but hadn\u2019t because \u201cwe collectively assumed this was a congressional responsibility,\u201d Moynihan said. Today, the Trump administration argues that states can do a better job than the department of serving the needs of students and families. But in South Bend, Indiana, school administrator Chad Addie says a federal grant has changed the face of education in his city over the last four years. The GEAR UP initiative allowed educators and business leaders to introduce more than 2,300 students to emerging job and college opportunities in Addie\u2019s district alone. Looking at the students this program helps daily, Addie said the work is far from over. \u201cThere are students right now who are counting on us because this is their moment in high school, this is their moment in middle school, and it\u2019s important that we\u2019re responsive in this moment for those students,\u201d Addie said. What comes next? Murphy\u2019s administrative leave is scheduled to end in June, and he does not know what he is going to do next. He is very concerned about the students, educators and school districts across the country that will need to scramble to fill budget holes to avoid laying off teachers or losing services without those federal dollars. When Murphy was put on administrative leave, he was unable to access his work email and had to turn over his badge and office computer. Many department employees lost their email access so quickly, they were unable to notify colleagues in state offices and school districts who they had been working with. Months later, no one has contacted him about transitioning his work to a different person or office. Following the federal judge\u2019s injunction against the Trump administration to stop its efforts to eliminate the Department of Education, federal human resources officials said in court documents that they had contacted all employees through personal e-mail about notice and copies of the May 22 court order. Murphy said no department officials had contacted him with updates about his employment status. \u201cBut did anyone expect them to?\u201d Murphy asked. For Downey, the court\u2019s decision \u201cis a win for ED staff, but it might take a while for folks to see and feel it.\u201d That includes him. Filing for early retirement and the department\u2019s fate uncertain, Downey said his paperwork must be received by June 9. \u201cThe clock is ticking against many of us even with the good news.\u201d In California, Superintendent Mike Matsuda leads Anaheim Union High School District, where roughly 4 in 5 students qualify for free or reduced meals, he said. He says his biggest challenge right now \u201cis the ambiguity and the uncertainty around budgeting.\u201d The district, home to 25,000 students, risks losing a tenth of its $425 million annual budget if federal funding for services such as professional development and English-language instruction goes away. Matsuda said this crunch comes at a strategically terrible time, when high school students are entering a job market disrupted by rapidly evolving technology, including artificial intelligence. Anticipating what these changes could mean for students whose families do not have money to fill in the gaps left by possible funding cuts, Sparks said if federal programs like GEAR UP are zeroed, \u201cthe opportunities go away.\u201d \u201cWhen those programs are gone, that route is not even gravel road. They have to pave their own route. When you hit a bump in the road, you don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the end or if you should keep going,\u201d Sparks said. \u201cChildren coming from homes that are impoverished should not be penalized more for not having that social safety net.\u201d Support PBS News Hour Your donation makes a difference in these uncertain times.

The time between getting infected and presenting with symptoms can span months or even years. To trace this contagious disease, Melanie Chitwood, a postdoctoral associate who studies the epidemiology of microbial diseases, worked with colleagues at Yale University to sequence the bacteria\u2019s genomic data, using that as a signal to detect transmission. Generations ago, public health workers in the United States had snuffed out most tuberculosis transmission. To study this illness Chitwood\u2019s team collected samples for more than a decade from places where the disease is more common, including Moldova and Malawi. Their work has contributed to understanding how to get one step ahead of the disease. But now, the federal grant funding that had supported Chitwood\u2019s yearslong research is gone. Weeks after President Donald Trump\u2019s second inauguration, his administration began to cancel grants to reduce what it called \u201cfraud, waste and abuse.\u201d Researchers who pursued anything that appeared to contradict his agenda in global health, race, gender identity, climate change and topics related to diversity, equity and inclusion saw their grants terminated. READ MORE: What happens to health research when \u2018women\u2019 and \u2018diversity\u2019 are banned words? Chitwood said \u201cit\u2019s starting to feel like the walls are closing in\u201d as opportunities to continue her research in the United States disappear. Like a growing number of scientists and experts, Chitwood is asking herself if she needs to pursue her research outside the country. \u201cIt feels like I need to either change what I do or change where I do it,\u201d Chitwood said. \u201cNeither of those options are pleasant.\u201d The administration\u2019s cuts to federal funding and hiring freezes at colleges and universities come at a crucial time. While cures exist for tuberculosis, public health experts are concerned those tools could be losing their edge. Evidence shows the bacteria that causes the disease is increasingly resistant to antibiotics that were once effective treatments. Cases of tuberculosis are reported occasionally in the U.S., where a century ago, it was a leading cause of death. For nearly three decades, the disease\u2019s prevalence has fallen, but that is changing. Last year, more than 10,000 U.S. cases of tuberculosis were confirmed, according to preliminary data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, marking an increase over recent years. As U.S. funding dries up, some researchers told PBS News life-saving answers are at risk of slipping through their fingers. Experts face a \u2018blitzkrieg against science\u2019 Throughout history, intellectuals have found themselves considering whether to flee a hostile environment. Before World War II, physicist Albert Einstein, mathematician Stanislaw Ulam and other scientists fled Europe to escape persecution and death during the Holocaust, finding refuge in the United States. Purges also consumed the educated class in the Soviet Union and Cambodia in the 20th century. Once in the United States, the work of these refugees contributed to the nation\u2019s post-war prosperity and helped make it a global leader in innovation, said Robert N. Proctor, a science historian at Stanford University. U.S. investments in research, he said, are \u201creally the seed corn of future knowledge.\u201d Trump\u2019s targeting of intellectuals will disrupt more than grant cycles, Proctor added, upending scientific infrastructure that took decades to build only to usher in \u201cthe golden age of ignorance.\u201d \u201cIt really is a blitzkrieg against science,\u201d he said. So far this year, roughly 2,400 grants at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have been terminated, according to Grant Watch, a project that has worked to chronicle the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to slash research funding. Some of the most common words in these terminated grants included \u201chiv,\u201d \u201cbiomedical,\u201d \u201crisk\u201d and \u201cdisparities.\u201d READ MORE: READ MORE: NIH scientists publish letter criticizing Trump\u2019s deep cuts in public health research Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said during his May 14 testimony before the House Appropriations Committee, \u201cWe will fund cutting-edge research at the NIH while cutting risky or non-essential services.\u201d He added that the administration would \u201celiminate DEI funding and redirect resources toward real poverty reduction.\u201d When Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., asked why the Trump administration had cut $18 billion from NIH, Kennedy repeatedly said that if Congress appropriated the funds for NIH, he would spend those funds that were required by law. \u201cWe have!\u201d DeLauro shot back. Since Trump\u2019s second term began, some widely respected scholars have left the U.S., including philosopher and fascism expert Jason Stanley from Yale University. Many more are considering leaving, according to a March 27 survey published in the journal Nature. Among more than 1,600 U.S. scientists, three-quarters said they have thought about leaving the country. Many said they were looking at Europe and Canada. In school, Chitwood had learned about Europe\u2019s World War II-era \u201cbrain drain,\u201d including the downstream effects of those losses, such as less innovation in medical care. \u201cThere are real and lasting consequences here,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re standing on the precipice of that.\u201d Other nations are capitalizing on U.S. loss While the U.S. is pulling back on its investments in innovation and research, other nations are eager to gain advantages through attracting a highly skilled workforce. The European Union announced the Choose Europe for Science initiative last month, devoting 500 million euros in grant funding to attract American scientists and scholars to Europe, where they can continue their research unfettered by political agendas. This expanded on a program established in 2017 by French President Emmanuel Macron during the first Trump administration. \u201cThis is a call to all free minds who want to advance science and stand up for a certain model of society,\u201d Macron said at the May 5 announcement of the initiative at the Sorbonne University in Paris. The uncertainty that these cuts generate is devastating for young people on the cusp of starting their careers in research, Proctor said. Many \u201cidealistic people who want to change the world\u201d will be driven to the private sector, he added. David Paltiel, a professor of public health at Yale University, said he is near the end of his career and can fall back on savings if he needs to. \u201cI will be able to weather the storm,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m much more concerned about junior faculty who are just getting started.\u201d Chitwood never planned on leaving New England. Born and raised in Rhode Island, she said the family of her husband, a physician, lives in Boston. In the last year, they had been talking about buying a house, starting a family of their own and living close enough so grandparent visits would be easy and frequent. Those plans are now frozen as Chitwood and her husband work to figure out if they must uproot their lives and start again elsewhere. \u201cIf the goal is to root out anyone who thinks that diversity is good, that equity is good, that we should fight injustice, then what do I do?\u201d she said. Maybe Canada is her next step. Or the Netherlands. Chitwood knows her work still matters and that it holds the power to help improve the health of people around the world, no matter where she lives.

So far this year, roughly 2,400 grants at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have been terminated, according to Grant Watch, a project that has worked to chronicle the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to slash research funding. Some of the most common words in these terminated grants included \u201chiv,\u201d \u201cbiomedical,\u201d \u201crisk\u201d and \u201cdisparities.\u201d READ MORE: READ MORE: NIH scientists publish letter criticizing Trump\u2019s deep cuts in public health research Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said during his May 14 testimony before the House Appropriations Committee, \u201cWe will fund cutting-edge research at the NIH while cutting risky or non-essential services.\u201d He added that the administration would \u201celiminate DEI funding and redirect resources toward real poverty reduction.\u201d When Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., asked why the Trump administration had cut $18 billion from NIH, Kennedy repeatedly said that if Congress appropriated the funds for NIH, he would spend those funds that were required by law. \u201cWe have!\u201d DeLauro shot back. Since Trump\u2019s second term began, some widely respected scholars have left the U.S., including philosopher and fascism expert Jason Stanley from Yale University. Many more are considering leaving, according to a March 27 survey published in the journal Nature. Among more than 1,600 U.S. scientists, three-quarters said they have thought about leaving the country. Many said they were looking at Europe and Canada. In school, Chitwood had learned about Europe\u2019s World War II-era \u201cbrain drain,\u201d including the downstream effects of those losses, such as less innovation in medical care. \u201cThere are real and lasting consequences here,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re standing on the precipice of that.\u201d Other nations are capitalizing on U.S. loss While the U.S. is pulling back on its investments in innovation and research, other nations are eager to gain advantages through attracting a highly skilled workforce. The European Union announced the Choose Europe for Science initiative last month, devoting 500 million euros in grant funding to attract American scientists and scholars to Europe, where they can continue their research unfettered by political agendas. This expanded on a program established in 2017 by French President Emmanuel Macron during the first Trump administration. \u201cThis is a call to all free minds who want to advance science and stand up for a certain model of society,\u201d Macron said at the May 5 announcement of the initiative at the Sorbonne University in Paris. The uncertainty that these cuts generate is devastating for young people on the cusp of starting their careers in research, Proctor said. Many \u201cidealistic people who want to change the world\u201d will be driven to the private sector, he added. David Paltiel, a professor of public health at Yale University, said he is near the end of his career and can fall back on savings if he needs to. \u201cI will be able to weather the storm,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m much more concerned about junior faculty who are just getting started.\u201d Chitwood never planned on leaving New England. Born and raised in Rhode Island, she said the family of her husband, a physician, lives in Boston. In the last year, they had been talking about buying a house, starting a family of their own and living close enough so grandparent visits would be easy and frequent. Those plans are now frozen as Chitwood and her husband work to figure out if they must uproot their lives and start again elsewhere. \u201cIf the goal is to root out anyone who thinks that diversity is good, that equity is good, that we should fight injustice, then what do I do?\u201d she said. Maybe Canada is her next step. Or the Netherlands. Chitwood knows her work still matters and that it holds the power to help improve the health of people around the world, no matter where she lives.

Immigrants \u2014 both documented and undocumented \u2014 make up a disproportionate share of the health care workforce, particularly in areas like long-term care for the elderly and people with disabilities, and their expulsion would make existing shortages much worse.\nYet Congress\u2019 decades-long inability to enact permanent fixes has left millions dependent on executive actions and discretionary programs that can be upended every time a new administration takes power \u2014 a situation people on all sides of the immigration debate agree is unsustainable.\nEven conservatives who favor President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to end humanitarian parole and temporary protected status acknowledge that doing so could harm several sectors of the economy \u2014 including agriculture and construction in addition to health care \u2014 but they argue the Biden administration misused those programs as a backdoor means of ushering in more permanent migration.\n\u201cThere are valid concerns, absolutely,\u201d said Simon Hankinson, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation. \u201cBut the solution we need is for Congress to determine what level of immigration we need, what skill level we need, what the conditions are, and then to pass laws. You can\u2019t just completely bypass Congress with executive action on immigration and expect this fragile edifice that we set up to survive.\u201d\nThe administration, meanwhile, dismisses the health industry\u2019s concerns.\n\u201cThe assertion that the only way we can take care of our seniors is by allowing unvetted illegal aliens and foreigners with criminal records to remain in the country is grossly false and lazy,\u201d DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to POLITICO. \u201cIf people want to come to our country to be caregivers for our seniors, they need to do that by coming here the legal way.\u201d\nWhen asked specifically about workers with temporary protected status and humanitarian parole \u2014 who entered the country legally after being vetted and sponsored \u2014 the agency did not respond. Past presidents have extended legal protections and work permits to hundreds of thousands of immigrants under those programs because they face dangerous conditions in their home countries.\nThe Trump administration is simultaneously ramping up enforcement, including in formerly off-limits spaces like hospitals and clinics. That\u2019s causing immigrants and their citizen relatives to avoid all kinds of medical care \u2014 from testing and treatment for infectious diseases to preventive care for chronic conditions like diabetes, driving up costs for taxpayers and threatening public health more broadly.\n\u201cIf they\u2019re afraid to even go to work or send their kids to school, they\u2019re certainly afraid to come to doctors\u2019 visits,\u201d said Sandy Reding, an emergency room nurse in Bakersfield and the president of the California Nurses Association. \u201cThey\u2019re not seeking medical attention when they should, and we\u2019re seeing time and time again that those delays in care are making things worse.\u201d\nReding said an uptick in Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity targeting her area\u2019s large population of migrant farmworkers has caused many to avoid care for conditions like diabetes and elevated blood pressure \u2014 leading to preventable amputations or strokes.\n\u201cAnd when it comes to things like measles and bird flu that are easily spread, it poses a threat to the whole community,\u201d she said.\n\u2018The quality of care will be poor\u2019\nA study published in the medical journal JAMA in April calculated that about a million non-citizen immigrants work in health care, including more than 366,500 who are undocumented. And no sector of the sprawling health care system would be harder hit by mass deportations than long-term care for the elderly and people with disabilities \u2014 where immigrants make up nearly 30 percent of the direct care workforce.\nIn an amicus brief opposing the Trump administration\u2019s bid to cancel humanitarian parole for half a million workers, the attorneys general for 15 states and Washington, D.C. noted that immigrants make up more than three quarters of home health aides in New York and nearly half in California.\nOn Friday, the Supreme Court gave the Trump administration the green light to begin deporting about a half-million immigrants who entered the U.S. legally under humanitarian parole programs implemented during the Biden administration. The decision came less than two weeks after the justices granted another immigration-related emergency request from the administration, allowing officials to end temporary protected status for approximately 350,000 Venezuelans.\nGiven already severe shortages of workers for typically low-paid and challenging care economy jobs, and a looming spike in demand for long-term care services as Baby Boomers age, the elder care industry is warning of an impending crisis.\nRob Liebreich, the CEO of Goodwin Living, worries he may have to accept fewer residents and cut back services if his workers are deported. Reducing the supply of long-term care workers amid increasing demand will also drive up the cost of services as facilities compete for those who remain, he said. That, in turn, could force more aging Americans to depend on untrained family members as caregivers, which then pulls those people out of the paid workforce.\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be a real drain on the overall economy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut more importantly, I just don\u2019t want to let down the current American older adult population, and we\u2019re absolutely going to let them down by not having enough hands to provide the services and support that they deserve and expect.\u201d\nLeadingAge \u2014 an advocacy group representing thousands of nursing homes, assisted living facilities, hospice programs and retirement homes around the country \u2014 echoed Liebreich\u2019s fears in a letter to the Department of Homeland Security in April, pleading with the agency to reconsider ending the parole program. They did not receive a response.\nThe Trump administration acknowledged some of these concerns in its March executive order canceling humanitarian parole for hundreds of thousands of immigrants, noting that there will be repercussions both for the individuals and their employers. Still, the order argued, both the immigrants and their employers knew that the protections were temporary and subject to the discretion of the federal government, and they should have applied for more permanent status.\nLiebreich said that while Goodwin Living has helped over 200 workers become citizens over the past decade and has set up the 65 currently at risk to meet with immigration attorneys, the Trump administration is closing off many of the other programs they would have been eligible for \u2014 like temporary protected status \u2014 and not giving them enough time to navigate the process.\n\u201cThey thought they had two years to work with, not mere months,\u201d he said.\nSaudatu Savage, a registered nurse at Goodwin Living who came as a refugee from Sierra Leone more than two decades ago and is now a U.S. citizen, said it will make her job much harder if dozens of her coworkers are forced to leave.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a disaster,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are not a lot of nurses out there, and there are going to be more and more patients. So it will be a burden on us and it\u2019s going to affect the whole health care system, and I fear the quality of care will be poor.\u201d\nWith the workers\u2019 status in limbo, even some staunch conservatives are warning of negative ramifications of the administration\u2019s crackdown, and are calling instead for an increase in visas for immigrants to work in health care.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just do across-the-board reductions and not have real challenges in areas where vital workers exist, especially in health care,\u201d said Tom Price, a former GOP congressman who served as the health secretary during Trump\u2019s first term and now works as a consultant. \u201cIf you just have across-the-board reductions, it will harm our ability to continue to provide care for folks at all different levels, whether it\u2019s acute or chronic care.\u201d\n\u2018Measles doesn\u2019t care about your immigration status\u2019\nWhen measles erupted among children in Minneapolis\u2019 large Somali community in May 2024, the city contracted with groups that work with the area\u2019s Somali, Hmong, Latin American and Native American populations, set up free vaccine clinics in their neighborhoods run by trusted community groups, deployed contact tracers, and produced videos in multiple languages urging vaccinations.\nA few months later, after identifying 52 cases and hospitalizing 12 people, they had it under control.\nBut local officials fear that now, amid the biggest measles outbreak the U.S. has seen in decades, including a few cases in Minnesota, they may not be as successful.\nHealth care providers in Minneapolis and around the country are reporting that since Trump took office and changed federal policy to allow immigration enforcement agents to detain people in hospitals and clinics, immigrants with and without documents are avoiding health services, including testing and treatment for infectious diseases and vaccinations.\n\u201cWhen people feel threatened, there\u2019s a chilling effect,\u201d said Michelle Rivero, the director of the city\u2019s Office of Immigration and Refugee Affairs, which was founded during the first Trump administration. \u201cThere is a greater sense of fear and anxiety with regard to accessing health care.\u201d\nThat chilling effect will be compounded, local officials warn, by the Trump administration\u2019s cuts to public health funding, which have forced the Minneapolis Public Health Department to shut down several vaccine clinics and end contracts with three community health organizations that were crucial in halting the 2024 measles outbreak: MHealth Fairview, Odam Medical Clinic, and Neighborhood HealthSource. The state\u2019s health department in April sent layoff and separation notices to 170 employees because of the funding cuts. Those employees worked in several areas including the state\u2019s response to measles.\nThe administration argued the funding should be cut because Congress had appropriated it to combat Covid-19 and the pandemic is over \u2014 though health departments around the country had been using the money to shore up defenses against other infectious diseases. Though a judge blocked the cuts from taking effect, that ruling could be overturned on appeal.\nAt a time when immigrant groups\u2019 already high distrust of government is even higher due to fears of immigration enforcement, said Deputy Health Commissioner Heidi Ritchie, public health departments won\u2019t be successful if they can\u2019t contract with non-governmental community groups to do outreach and provide services.\n\u201cWith the loss of those contracts, we can\u2019t be confident that we\u2019re able to serve a population when there\u2019s another measles outbreak,\u201d she said. \u201cMeasles doesn\u2019t care about your immigration status or your ethnicity. But when we are providing these clinics, they\u2019re free, and they are in community spaces that people already have trust with.\u201d\nUnder pressure from the Trump administration, several states including Minnesota and California are also rolling back programs that provide health insurance to undocumented immigrants, putting testing and treatment for infectious diseases further out of reach.\nIn addition to measles, public health leaders are concerned about the impact of Trump\u2019s immigration policies on efforts to combat tuberculosis \u2014 a bacterial infection the U.S. nearly eradicated decades ago that is now resurging from Kansas City to Los Angeles.\n\u201cPeople are, all of a sudden, a little bit leery of presenting themselves in congregate settings where they might be targets for enforcement,\u201d said Lori Tremmel Freeman, CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials. \u201cIt really is emanating out of a greater fear of those places being actively monitored by ICE.\u201d\nThe Trump administration and advocacy groups that want to restrict immigration say higher levels of tuberculosis in immigrant communities justifies turning people away at the border. But Freeman and other experts stress that while the infections are more prevalent in those communities, it has nothing to do with their country of origin and everything to do with crowded living conditions and a lack of access to vaccines, which is why TB outbreaks are also common in U.S. homeless shelters and prisons. By implementing policies that deter immigrants from seeking health services, she argued, the Trump administration could make the situation worse.\n\u201cWe are worried, from a public health standpoint, that people will tie tuberculosis outbreaks to immigrant communities unfairly and traumatize those groups even more,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cWe were fearful that it might be used by the administration to say, \u2018This is a disease they bring in. We\u2019ve got to get them out of the country.\u2019\u201d\nTo reach those fearful of coming in for services, some public health departments are ramping up telehealth services, while others are creating mobile units so that immigrants don\u2019t have to leave their neighborhoods. Still others are posting know-your-rights information in multiple languages for their patients, and coaching providers on what to do in the event of a raid.\n\u201cOur union has trained us on what to do if ICE comes into our hospitals,\u201d said the California Nurses Association\u2019s Reding. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been patient advocates but right now the need for that is even stronger.\u201d\nYet both research and anecdotal reports suggest that the health care repercussions of restrictive immigration policies can extend beyond their target populations and linger long after the policies themselves are lifted.\nA 2021 study found that the \u201cpublic charge\u201d rule in the first Trump administration \u2014 which penalized legal immigrants who used government safety net programs \u2014 led many low-income immigrants to avoid using health services, including more than a quarter of legal permanent residents, who were not subject to the rule. The chilling effect began years before the policy took effect, fueled by rhetoric from federal government officials, researchers found.\nAnother study, published in 2022, found that legal immigrants without green cards were still avoiding care more than a year after President Joe Biden got rid of the rule.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve created fear and distrust of the health care system in the immigrant community even without enforcement,\u201d said Arturo Vargas Bustamante, a professor at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health. \u201cThis has big implications, including for mixed status households and U.S. citizen children, and it could be both costly and fatal.\u201d", "War-torn Ukraine provides possible model for Louisiana addiction treatment. 5:00\nNews Story\nWar-torn Ukraine provides possible model for Louisiana addiction treatment\n5:00\nNews Story\nWar-torn Ukraine provides possible model for Louisiana addiction treatment\nAn addicted man pricks his finger to test himself for HIV and hepatitis at a mobile health clinic in Kyiv, Ukraine. (Photo by Delaney Nolan for Louisiana Illuminator)\nAn addicted man pricks his finger to test himself for HIV and hepatitis at a mobile health clinic in Kyiv, Ukraine. (Photo by Delaney Nolan for Louisiana Illuminator)\nNEW ORLEANS \u2013 Every morning, to avoid getting sick, Jessica Baudean must take a long trip across the Mississippi. Baudean, who is disabled, lived in a tent near Tchoupitoulas Street until she received housing support in 2022, and now lives with her partner in an apartment in Avondale.\nBeaudean and her partner, Terry Asevado, are methadone patients. Once heroin users, they now take a prescribed daily dose of methadone \u2013 a synthetic opioid medication which relieves them of their withdrawal symptoms and cravings. Baudean and Asevado say it\u2019s changed their lives and allowed them to function.\nBut to get the medication, the couple must travel for hours every day. If they can\u2019t get a ride through Medicaid, Baudean must climb into her wheelchair and have Asevado push her 1.4 miles to the nearest bus stop. Then they spend an hour taking two buses,crossing the river to reach the only clinic on the city\u2019s East Bank which is allowed to give them their medicine. If they arrive even a minute past noon, they miss their dose. If they miss a dose, they may be denied the next one. And if they\u2019re arrested?\n\u201cPoor Terry,\u201d sighs Baudean. \u201cI know he\u2019s still going to be sick right now.\u201d\nAs the Trump administration cracks down on immigrants and hikes tariffs on Mexican imports, largely in the name of fighting the fentanyl crisis, a look at the experience of local people wrestling with substance use disorder suggests different approaches could be more effective.\nLouisiana has among the highest overdose death rates nationwide. It\u2019s also embattled by repeated disasters, internal migration and displacement, and poor public health support. And examples of effective drug policy under similar pressures can be found in a surprising place, far from the Gulf South: Ukraine.\nPrison here, prison there\nIn a corridor within Strizhavka Detention Center, a medium-security prison complex in Vinnytsia, Ukraine, Iana Romaniuk smacks the glowing blue button of a vending machine. Inside, a sterile syringe tumbles to the bottom.\n\u201cThere are clean needles, lubricants and condoms\u201d \u2013 and no cameras, explains Romaniuk, who works with Free Zone, an organization providing harm reduction services in Ukrainian prisons.\n\u201cIt\u2019s new, installed 10 days ago,\u201d she adds, with a hint of pride.\nRomaniuk, an unassuming woman with glasses and straight brown hair, spends her days advocating for the men in this sprawling prison complex and attached hospital. Though far from the frontlines, the specter of war hangs overhead. Security guards forbid photos of an old sign written in Russian, the language of their invaders.\nThe vending machine at the facility in central Ukraine is just part of one of the world\u2019s most effective harm reduction networks, still going \u2013 and growing \u2013 after three years of war.\nHarm reduction is a public health approach that emphasizes minimizing the negative physical and social impacts of risky behavior. It aims to inform and support, rather than punish, drug users. It can mean supplying clean needles and naloxone, which can reverse an overdose. And it involves testing for HIV, hepatitis, tuberculosis, and other diseases.\nIn Strizhavka, about 3\u00bd hours southeast of Kyiv, more than 25% of the 400 inmates receive opioid substitution therapy, or OST, just like Baudean and Asevado back in Louisiana. Here, a doctor distributes it in tiny paper cups from a pump bottle.\nSince the prison began offering inmates free, clean syringes, it has seen zero new HIV cases. The prison even has a program that trains interested inmates to be social workers. Trained inmates support their incarcerated peers and can potentially work in addiction recovery after their release.\nThe radically different approach is striking because, though 5,000 miles apart, Ukraine and Louisiana wrestle with similar public health challenges. Ukraine has among the highest HIV and intravenous drug use rates in Europe, trailing only Russia. Louisiana has the fourth highest HIV rate in the U.S., the fifth highest rate for drug overdose mortality and disproportionately high levels of hepatitis C, a viral infection commonly spread through sharing needles.\n\u201cLouisiana is very unique with its positioning,\u201d said Ellis Lee, a former employee of New Orleans\u2019 Syringe Access Program (NOSAP) at Crescent Care. \u201cWe have so many viral illnesses, historically, in part because we\u2019re a port city.\u201d\nTo grapple with the crisis, Louisiana has made some policy updates in recent years. New Orleans\u2019 City Council decriminalized fentanyl test strips in 2021, and Narcan has helped slow overdose deaths. But drug policy in the U.S. South \u2013 and in Russia \u2013 has remained largely punitive, while Ukraine\u2019s has grown steadily more progressive \u2013 partly in reaction to Russia\u2019s approach.\nThe contrasts are many. Hypodermic needle exchanges exist all over Ukraine and are rapidly expanding. In Louisiana, needle exchanges are only allowed in East Baton Rouge Parish, New Orleans, Shreveport and Alexandria. NOSAP is the Gulf South\u2019s largest needle exchange, serving over 2000 people in six months. There are no syringe exchanges in Louisiana prisons.\nThe results speak for themselves. Before the war, Ukraine had seen an 81% reduction in AIDS mortality since 2010, according to the Ukrainiain Public Health Center, and drug overdose rates fell in 2021.\nMeanwhile, drug overdoses in Louisiana rates more than quintupled between 2017 and 2022 \u2013 from 401 to 2,376 \u2013 and hepatitis C infections are increasing, based on numbers from the state health department and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nSince the war began in February 2022, Ukraine\u2019s harm reduction networks have successfully pushed the government to expand services in light of the crisis. That\u2019s partly how, as one incarcerated person put it, \u201ccivilization came to this place.\u201d\n\u2018The best way to torture somebody\u2019\nBeaudean\u2019s partner, Terry Asevado, was arrested this spring in Jefferson Parish for bringing contraband into a correctional center. He\u2019s still in jail because they can\u2019t afford his $10,000 bail. Baudean said she knows he\u2019s suffering because the Jefferson Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office does not facilitate prescribed methadone for people in jail. Baudean remembers a time she was arrested and cut off from her medication.\n\u201cI wanted to kill myself, straight up, but I didn\u2019t have the guts to do it,\u201d she recalls.\nBaudean remembers weeks of sleeplessness, being unable to hold down food or water, throwing up bile, finding all noise excruciating.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the best way to torture somebody. Get them addicted to some stuff, and then put them in a room and lock it.\u201d\nFederal and state regulations permit jailed patients to receive methadone, but parishes would need to coordinate with the local methadone clinic to do so, according to Traci Perry, Louisiana\u2019s State Opioid Treatment Authority. Gretna\u2019s methadone clinic is run by Behavioral Health Group. They say they\u2019ve never been contacted by Jefferson Parish Corrections, nor by CorrectHealth, the company that provides medical services for the jail.\n\u201cWe would look forward to the opportunity to begin a relationship with them, so they can best serve our patients,\u201d said Michelle Peres-Tenorio, BHG\u2019s program director.\nMost correctional facilities bring in an outside contractor to provide medication-assisted treatment services, Peres-Tenoria added. The treatment typically involves a non-methadone medication for \u201ca very limited amount of days,\u201d followed by only over-the-counter medication, she said. \u201cThe staff is typically not educated on methadone treatment.\u201d\nA JPSO public information officer told the Illuminator the department has no policy on the matter and referred questions to CorrectHealth, which did not respond to queries.\nMobile outreach testing\nHarm reduction also entails making sure people can get testing and treatment for illnesses associated with drug use. That\u2019s why, inside a van parked near a Kyiv methadone clinic, behind sheer peach-colored curtains, Mykolai, an addicted man who declined to share his last name, folded himself into a seat at a tiny plastic table. Leaning in, Valeriy Timoshenko, a social worker with the Ukrainian harm reduction organization Convictus, helped him prick his finger. Mykolai pinched a plastic dropper to carefully take a few drops of blood, releasing them onto two HIV and hepatitis testing strips laid out before him.\n\u201cYou\u2019re living with a partner, so I can give you one to take home,\u201d Timoshenko told him. The results of the tests \u2013 HIV and hepatitis \u2013 take a few minutes to appear. \u201cIf your results are positive, I will describe where you should go to get free treatment.\u201d\nMykolai, a 38-year-old former landscaper, handed Timoshenko a card. Printed on the card is a QR code that Timoshenko can scan to see how often Mykolai has gotten tested and some of his medical history. The card also qualifies Mykolai to receive a small payment \u2013 100 Ukrainian hryvnia, equal to about $2.40 \u2013 for being tested. Mykolai also got five cards to hand out to friends, slowly building a kind of self-testing network.\nMykolai looked down, his expression neutral. The HIV test was negative, but he\u2019d tested positive for hepatitis C.\nLouisiana does have some mobile outreach testing units. Some groups, like Below Sea Level Aid, also offer incentives when they can. But while Ukrainian police are forbidden from approaching the clinic or Timoshenko\u2019s van, \u201cpolice used to stake out NOSAP,\u201d said Below Sea Level Aid founder Jack Waguespack, which he said deters the group from parking its testing unit outside clinics.\nWar, storms, and displacement\nAlready, there has been some exchange of expertise between Ukraine and Louisiana.\nOn a February afternoon, Velta Parkhomenko, project manager of the NGO Club Eney, a woman-focused harm reduction organization in Kyiv, sat before a screen as chatter from a sobriety meeting filtered in from the next room. Parkhomenko and another Ukrainian harm reduction worker were meeting online with two of their peers from Louisiana, who asked their names not be disclosed for fear of reprisal at their workplace. Talking excitedly through the screens, they ticked through some policy differences in their respective homes.\nPerhaps the biggest: prescription parity.\nIn Ukraine, where about 20,000 people receive opioid substitution treatment, patients can go to government or private clinics for methadone prescriptions, get them filled at any pharmacy, and then take home a 10-day supply. Thanks to advocacy efforts, patients were given 30-day supplies during certain periods of the war.\n\u201cThat is not how that works here,\u201d one Louisiana worker said, startled enough to laugh. Patients \u201chave to fight really hard to be able to even just get a seven-day take home\u201d supply, they said.\nMethadone is among the most controlled substances in the U.S., meaning it\u2019s under restrictions that make acquiring it especially difficult for patients. In the event of a natural disaster, it has to be transported to impacted areas under armed guard.\nJust one methadone clinic exists on Orleans Parish\u2019s east bank, serving more than 900 OST patients.\nClinics are meant to hand out extra take-home supply before storms, but adoption of that policy is up to the discretion of clinics, and has not been widespread, according to sources familiar with the issue. During evacuations, there is no protocol in place for ensuring an OST patient has continued access to medication, nor gauging need \u2013 unlike, say, dialysis patients.\nLouisiana\u2019s State Opioid Treatment Authority, part of its state health department, makes decisions about methadone dosing sites and transportation during declared emergencies, which then require approval from federal officials.\nThe divergence in policy is notable since Ukraine and Louisiana are both deeply familiar with displacement and evacuations.\nSitting in her office in a quiet apartment block in Kyiv, Tatiana Lebid wears a pink headband and sparkling eye shadow. She\u2019s the founder of VONA, an organization for women who use drugs, as well as a recovering addict.\nShe lists the effects of the war on her country, many of which will sound familiar to those who lived through Hurricane Katrina and other major storms: post-traumatic stress disorder, the destruction of medical facilities, a \u201cbrain drain\u201d that\u2019s reduced the number of health care workers, and a spike in domestic violence. Lost documents, displacement, unemployment and increased police encounters with curfews in effect are also commonplace, she said.\nLebid herself was shaken last year when a drone dropped bombs just behind her apartment block. She recalled leaning out her window to try and see the damage, certain the bomb had destroyed her car. It was spared, but she has felt the fear that has driven millions to flee Ukraine.\nA major part of VONA\u2019s work is to ensure people forced to flee can continue receiving treatment and support. They help Ukrainians replace lost identification documents and refer users to nearby OST clinics using a simple tool: a telephone hotline.\nLebid\u2019s colleagues field calls from every region in the country, from prisons, and even from Ukrainian soldiers on the frontlines. OST recipients were exempt from being conscripted into the military until March 2024, though some still are not draft eligible because of their HIV or tuberculosis status.\nBodhan Protsenko, manning the phones, says the beginning of war saw a dramatic uptick in calls: 50-70 per day, up from eight before the war, he said.\nProtsenko pays special attention to the soldiers\u2019 calls. He served a year and a half on the frontline and knows how hard it can be. Lately, he\u2019s seen an uptick in soldiers using opiates. He isn\u2019t surprised \u2013 the drugs can help with stress and sleep, he said.\n\u2018I understand how to do this in a smart way\u2019\nBack in Strizhavka, Romaniuk leaves the vending machine behind and enters a small office. Yellow light falls over the wallpaper. Outside, an inmate chops firewood.\nAdvocates say prisons are where the need for harm reduction services, like clean needles, are most needed. Syringes on the black market can cost a hundred times more what they cost outside prison, which leads to reuse and illness. HIV rates are 25 times higher for the incarcerated.\nNeedle exchange programs in Ukraine count more than 900 incarcerated clients and some 20,000 syringes replaced as of this spring. Before beginning its exchange program a year ago, the Strizhavka prison used to see a handful of new HIV cases each year. This year, they\u2019ve seen none.\nOleksandr Lushnia, sitting against the wall and smiling shyly, is one of the prison\u2019s incarcerated people who\u2019ve been trained as addiction social workers. A former construction worker, he was put in prison about three years ago for stealing a bicycle.\n\u201cBefore this program, people could take dirty needles from trash bins \u2013 broken, dirty needles. Or they\u2019d pay money to get clean needles, which meant they had to do different harmful things,\u201d Lushnia said. \u201cNow, people get infections less. I feel good. I understand how to do this [manage addiction] in a smart way, and tell other people how to.\u201d\nLushnia took eight lessons in social work over one month, and was trained in how to administer Narcan and treat overdoses. He hopes to continue working in addiction recovery once released. Out of more than 400 inmates trained through the program, 77 have become certified social workers within the prison program.\nAnd the war has only spurred Ukraine to bolster its efforts.\nIn fall 2022, Russian forces entered and occupied the southern city of Kherson, including the prisons there. Soldiers cut off OST, which is banned in Russia, for all inmates \u2013 then flaunted the decision on Russian state media.\nIn response, Ukraine stood firm \u2013 and in fact further expanded OST services, from three prisons to 10, now serving more than 500 people.\nNow, there are fears U.S. policy on opioid addiction treatment could become more regressive under the Trump administration. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., head of the Department of Health and Human Services, has talked about \u201chealing farms\u201d or work camps for people with addiction, similar to the system once used in Soviet Russia.\nBaudean would like to see Louisiana, instead, draw some lessons from Ukraine \u2013 like having more clinics, staffed by more counselors with lived experience of addiction, like Parkhomenko. There are formerly addicted people \u201cthat really changed their life, and they did the right thing and turned it around,\u201d says Baudean. \u201cSo why don\u2019t we hire the ones that did, to teach the ones that can\u2019t?\u201d\nThis reporting was supported by the International Women\u2019s Media Foundation\u2019s Women on the Ground: Reporting from Ukraine\u2019s Unseen Frontlines Initiative in partnership with the Howard G.

The Food and Drug Administration approved Wednesday a powerful new drug that provides nearly complete protection against HIV infection with just a single administration every six months.\nThe injection, known chemically as lenacapavir and to be marketed as Yeztugo, has been hailed as the closest thing the field has ever had to a vaccine \u2014 a groundbreaking intervention that, if rolled out properly, could bring a 45-year-old pandemic to heel. Drugs to prevent HIV, called PrEP, have been around for a decade, but they generally require taking a daily pill and have not substantially curbed global infections.\n\u201cIt really could be a game changer, particularly in areas heavily affected by HIV,\u201d said John Brooks, former chief medical officer of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s division of HIV prevention.\nYet excitement among advocates and researchers has dimmed since the first data came out last year \u2014 not over the drug, but over the climate in which it will be released. The Trump administration has eviscerated federal support for HIV treatment and prevention overseas and cut public health and HIV prevention programs in the U.S. Some of the domestic cuts were rolled back in the past week, but the administration is still proposing a significant cut to HIV work in next year\u2019s budget.\nThose moves have raised doubts about how broadly Yeztugo will reach populations most in need both in the U.S. and around the world. Linda-Gail Bekker, a South African researcher who led one of the two pivotal trials, said she now feared it could be a couple of years before the drug is rolled out in her country and others.\nMeanwhile, infections may rise as patients and at-risk individuals lose medicines and services they received through the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which was credited with saving 26 million lives before the Administration froze much of its funding.\n\u201cIt\u2019s tragic beyond belief if that\u2019s the way it plays out,\u201d said Bekker, Deputy Director of the Desmond Tutu HIV Centre in Cape Town.\nGilead did not immediately disclose a price for the drug. ViiV charges around $4,000 per injection for its once-every-two-month drug Apretude.\nIn the U.S., the hope is the drug can both provide a more convenient option for existing PrEP users and also attract people who have been unable to or faced challenges adhering to a daily pill.\nOne challenge for both the company and providers will be getting insurers to pay for a pricey brand-name medicine when a generic is available. Truvada, a pill that had been a huge seller for Gilead, has been off-patent since 2021. Analysts and clinicians expect insurers will impose hurdles, such as requiring patients to try a generic first.\nJared Beatan, Gilead\u2019s vice president of HIV clinical development, characterized the price as \u201cgenerally in line\u201d with other PrEP drugs while \u201crecognizing the value in the innovation.\u201d He said the company expects 90% of insured Americans will have coverage within a year, while access programs help people obtain medicine if they are uninsured or waiting for coverage to come through.\nThe Foster City, Calif., company has a lot riding on getting the medicine used as widely as possible in the U.S. and Europe. An HIV powerhouse for decades, Gilead has spent over $40 billion since 2019 trying to acquire and develop drugs for cancer and autoimmune diseases, with middling results. \u201cInvestors certainly complain that they haven\u2019t got a lot to show for all the money they spent,\u201d said Brian Skorney, an analyst at Baird.\nYeztugo is the only drug poised to grow the company, with Wall Street projecting Gilead will earn $3.2 billion annually from the drug by 2030. Today, around 500,000 people in the U.S. take some form of PrEP, out of around 2.2 million the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates may benefit from the drug. Gilead said it would like to push that number to 1 million by 2030.\n\u201cWe believe at Gilead, that lenacapavir is potentially the best tool we\u2019ve had yet to end the epidemic,\u201d CEO Dan O\u2019Day said in an interview.\nNext best thing to a vaccine\nIn 1984, Margaret Heckler, Ronald Reagan\u2019s Health Secretary, stood at a Washington podium and announced researchers had identified the virus that causes AIDS. A vaccine, she declared, would be \u201cready for testing within two years.\u201d\nHeckler\u2019s promise would haunt the field for nearly half a century. HIV proved wilier than any virus humanity had ever encountered. It infects immune cells that try to destroy it. It shapeshifts easily, evading most antibodies. After a string of recent failures, there are today no HIV vaccine candidates even in late-stage trials.\nLenacapavir emerged from left field. Work on the drug began around 20 years ago, when a Gilead researchers tried to build a molecule that could break up HIV\u2019s protective outer shell, called a capsid. The target was considered, in industry parlance, \u201cundruggable.\u201d Each capsid was made of 1,500 parts. How could one tiny molecule interrupt them all?\nIn 2009, the company nearly gave up, as recounted in a recent book. \u201cWe were scraping the bottom of the barrel for ideas,\u201d Thomas Cihlar, Gilead\u2019s head of virology, recalled. That\u2019s when Cihlar learned of PF74, a capsid-targeting molecule Pfizer abandoned when it shuttered its antiviral work in 2007.\nPF74 was an accelerator. It made the protein shell come together faster. Like in a rushed construction job, the resulting capsid was misformed. PF74 was a weak drug itself. It barely disrupted the virus. And it would be chewed up by the body within minutes. \u201cThe molecule was so inherently problematic from the beginning,\u201d said John Link, who directed chemistry work on the drug.\nBut over the course of six years, Gilead chemists tweaked, added and removed atoms to make it more potent and stable, churning through over 4,000 different iterations, until they had a hulking and unusually long-lasting molecule that interferes with the virus on multiple levels. \u201cWe\u2019ve had the persistence, right, and commitment,\u201d said Cihlar. \u201cI would say Pfizer didn\u2019t.\u201d\nThe molecule was so stable, Link said, that it\u2019s not metabolized by the liver as virtually all drugs are, and leaves through a slow, alternative mechanism.\nLenacapavir was first approved in 2022 as a treatment for drug-resistant HIV. Last year, two randomized clinical trials, run in South Africa, Uganda, the U.S., Brazil, Thailand, Argentina, Peru and Mexico showed it offered nearly complete protection against HIV with two shots every six months.\nOne of the trials, run in at-risk women and girls, showed it provided far superior protection to a daily PrEP pill, which people often face difficulty or stigma taking. Moreover, it\u2019s not entirely without side effects. The injections can be painful and leave noticeable nodules on the skin.\nYeztugo is now the second long-acting injectable drug to prevent HIV, after ViiV Healthcare\u2019s once-every-two-month injection Apretude. Researchers and analysts expect the twice-yearly injection will prove far more attractive to patients.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a vaccine, we don\u2019t have any vaccine on the horizon,\u201d said Myron Cohen, \u201cSo these are great alternatives.\u201d\nResearchers hope Yeztugo is the latest in a wave of new, long-acting drugs to treat and prevent HIV. Gilead is planning to begin a Phase 3 trial later this year for a once-every-year formulation of lenacapavir. It\u2019s also testing whether lenacapavir, in combination with so-called broadly neutralizing antibodies, can provide a once-every-six-month treatment. A once-a-week pill is also in the works.\nTrump-era hurdles\nScale-up of the drug was supposed to be fast. In October, Gilead signed deals to allow generic manufacturers to produce and sell the drug, royalty free, in 120 low and middle income countries. Because it will take a couple of years for those producers to ramp up production, Gilead announced in December with PEPFAR and The Global Fund to provide doses for 2 million people in those countries over the next three years.\nThe Trump Administration\u2019s slashing of support for PEPFAR has thrown that deal into question. Gilead Chief Commercial Officer Johanna Mercier told Reuters last month that, even if PEPFAR pulls out, \u201cour goal is still to meet that objective of 2 million people getting access.\u201d But Baeten declined to provide details on how it planned to do so, if PEPFAR or Global Fund don\u2019t purchase the doses.\n\u201cI think that there\u2019s a lot to be figured out on that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut our commitment\u2026 is unwavering.\u201d\nIn the U.S., it remains unclear how many PrEP users will want to switch over from daily pills. RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams conducted a survey of people currently taking a PrEP medication and found about one-third plan to ask their physician for the Gilead drug or schedule an appointment to discuss it. And another 55% would consider discussing the treatment with their physician.\nHowever, the survey also found that most people who are not currently taking a PrEP medication do not view themselves as sufficiently high risk for HIV or want to take medications, and do not see the shot as meaningfully advantageous compared with pills. Overall, less than 15% of 135 people queried plan to proactively request the drug.\nBut 70% of 560 patients surveyed are aware of lenacapavir, which is quite high for a drug not yet approved, according to Jefferies analyst Michale Yee. \u201cIt is encouraging the word is already out there, and increases confidence people will swap given high awareness,\u201d he wrote investors. And 40% of those queried already take a prevention medicine, and nearly all would like to swap within six to 12 months of approval.\nIn short, it may be difficult to truly predict what many patients will do several months from now, but some clinicians are expecting significant demand, including from people who have faced challenges taking daily pills. These include people who are experiencing homelessness or use substances, said Monica Gandhi, Director of the UCSF Center for AIDS Research. \u201cI think they will really benefit,\u201d she said.\nYet there will be notable hurdles to usage. The Trump administration slashed the CDC\u2019s division of HIV prevention in April, including a group that was working on guidance for how providers should use Yeztugo. The administration rolled back those layoffs this month, but it remains unclear how many people were brought back or how the disruptions have impacted the agency\u2019s work.\nCongress is also considering a substantial cut to Medicaid, which provides coverage to 40% of people living with HIV under 65. And the Supreme Court is weighing a case that could lift a requirement that private insurers cover PrEP without a co-pay.\nIn addition, local public health departments are laying off staff who would be involved in outreach, as the Administration moves to cut or rescind funds. Fulton County, which includes most of Atlanta, just cut 17 workers from its health department.\n\u201cIf we remained at the status quo, we would already be facing an uphill battle simply based on the price of the drug,\u201d said Michael Chancley, communications manager of Prep4All and a co-founding member of PrEP in Black America, who lives and works in Atlanta. Now \u201cit\u2019s just going to get that much harder.\u201d\nThe fear is that the drug could, like other PrEP drugs, be most widely used among wealthy and white communities, while remaining out of reach for others at risk. James Krellenstein, managing director of PrEP4All, said he has yet to see a clear plan from Gilead for reaching these groups.\n\u201cAre we going to make the same mistake we made with all the new prep options so far?\u201d said Anu Hazra, director of STI services for the Chicago Center of HIV Elimination.\nOne major challenge will be insurance coverage. Payers may be reluctant to cover an expensive branded drug when generic pills exist.\nAbrahams, the RBC Capital Markets analyst, also recently polled nine pharmacy benefit managers and found that roughly 60% of individuals on PrEP take generic Truvada. All payers, he wrote, are likely to impose so-called step therapy: requiring a patient to try a generic before lenacapavir. Although \u201cpotentially surmountable,\u201d these requirements will likely \u201cput a ceiling\u201d on how many patients switch to the new drug in the near-term.\n\u201cThis indicates that we will likely continue seeing high generic Truvada use,\u201d he wrote in an investor note, adding, \u201cIt is unclear how quickly individuals and their physicians would be able to convince their respective plans that side effects or oral administration of generic Truvada are prohibitive.\u201d\nStill, Hazra is upbeat. Insurers have also imposed hurdles to Apretude, the once-every-two-month injectable, slowing rollout. But his clinic has still been able to give it to over 500 patients. They are preparing procedures for administering lenacapavir, assuming CDC guidance won\u2019t come.\n\u201cMyself and a lot of others are excited,\u201d he said. \u201cIn spite of everything going on, this is something to look forward to and something that will make a real impact.\u201d\nMatthew Herper contributed reporting.", "Researchers warn U.S. is on the &lsquo;precipice&rsquo; of brain drain as Trump cuts federal grants.

The time between getting infected and presenting with symptoms can span months or even years. To trace this contagious disease, Melanie Chitwood, a postdoctoral associate who studies the epidemiology of microbial diseases, worked with colleagues at Yale University to sequence the bacteria\u2019s genomic data, using that as a signal to detect transmission. Generations ago, public health workers in the United States had snuffed out most tuberculosis transmission. To study this illness Chitwood\u2019s team collected samples for more than a decade from places where the disease is more common, including Moldova and Malawi. Their work has contributed to understanding how to get one step ahead of the disease. But now, the federal grant funding that had supported Chitwood\u2019s yearslong research is gone. Weeks after President Donald Trump\u2019s second inauguration, his administration began to cancel grants to reduce what it called \u201cfraud, waste and abuse.\u201d Researchers who pursued anything that appeared to contradict his agenda in global health, race, gender identity, climate change and topics related to diversity, equity and inclusion saw their grants terminated.

While cures exist for tuberculosis, public health experts are concerned those tools could be losing their edge. Evidence shows the bacteria that causes the disease is increasingly resistant to antibiotics that were once effective treatments. Cases of tuberculosis are reported occasionally in the U.S., where a century ago, it was a leading cause of death. For nearly three decades, the disease\u2019s prevalence has fallen, but that is changing. Last year, more than 10,000 U.S. cases of tuberculosis were confirmed, according to preliminary data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, marking an increase over recent years. As U.S. funding dries up, some researchers told PBS News life-saving answers are at risk of slipping through their fingers. Experts face a \u2018blitzkrieg against science\u2019 Throughout history, intellectuals have found themselves considering whether to flee a hostile environment. Before World War II, physicist Albert Einstein, mathematician Stanislaw Ulam and other scientists fled Europe to escape persecution and death during the Holocaust, finding refuge in the United States. Purges also consumed the educated class in the Soviet Union and Cambodia in the 20th century. Once in the United States, the work of these refugees contributed to the nation\u2019s post-war prosperity and helped make it a global leader in innovation, said Robert N. Proctor, a science historian at Stanford University. U.S. investments in research, he said, are \u201creally the seed corn of future knowledge.\u201d Trump\u2019s targeting of intellectuals will disrupt more than grant cycles, Proctor added, upending scientific infrastructure that took decades to build only to usher in \u201cthe golden age of ignorance.\u201d \u201cIt really is a blitzkrieg against science,\u201d he said. So far this year, roughly 2,400 grants at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have been terminated, according to Grant Watch, a project that has worked to chronicle the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to slash research funding. Some of the most common words in these terminated grants included \u201chiv,\u201d \u201cbiomedical,\u201d \u201crisk\u201d and \u201cdisparities.\u201d READ MORE: READ MORE: NIH scientists publish letter criticizing Trump\u2019s deep cuts in public health research Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said during his May 14 testimony before the House Appropriations Committee, \u201cWe will fund cutting-edge research at the NIH while cutting risky or non-essential services.\u201d He added that the administration would \u201celiminate DEI funding and redirect resources toward real poverty reduction.\u201d When Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., asked why the Trump administration had cut $18 billion from NIH, Kennedy repeatedly said that if Congress appropriated the funds for NIH, he would spend those funds that were required by law. \u201cWe have!\u201d DeLauro shot back. Since Trump\u2019s second term began, some widely respected scholars have left the U.S., including philosopher and fascism expert Jason Stanley from Yale University. Many more are considering leaving, according to a March 27 survey published in the journal Nature. Among more than 1,600 U.S. scientists, three-quarters said they have thought about leaving the country. Many said they were looking at Europe and Canada. In school, Chitwood had learned about Europe\u2019s World War II-era \u201cbrain drain,\u201d including the downstream effects of those losses, such as less innovation in medical care. \u201cThere are real and lasting consequences here,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re standing on the precipice of that.\u201d Other nations are capitalizing on U.S. loss While the U.S. is pulling back on its investments in innovation and research, other nations are eager to gain advantages through attracting a highly skilled workforce. The European Union announced the Choose Europe for Science initiative last month, devoting 500 million euros in grant funding to attract American scientists and scholars to Europe, where they can continue their research unfettered by political agendas. This expanded on a program established in 2017 by French President Emmanuel Macron during the first Trump administration. \u201cThis is a call to all free minds who want to advance science and stand up for a certain model of society,\u201d Macron said at the May 5 announcement of the initiative at the Sorbonne University in Paris. The uncertainty that these cuts generate is devastating for young people on the cusp of starting their careers in research, Proctor said. Many \u201cidealistic people who want to change the world\u201d will be driven to the private sector, he added. David Paltiel, a professor of public health at Yale University, said he is near the end of his career and can fall back on savings if he needs to. \u201cI will be able to weather the storm,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m much more concerned about junior faculty who are just getting started.\u201d Chitwood never planned on leaving New England. Born and raised in Rhode Island, she said the family of her husband, a physician, lives in Boston. In the last year, they had been talking about buying a house, starting a family of their own and living close enough so grandparent visits would be easy and frequent. Those plans are now frozen as Chitwood and her husband work to figure out if they must uproot their lives and start again elsewhere. \u201cIf the goal is to root out anyone who thinks that diversity is good, that equity is good, that we should fight injustice, then what do I do?\u201d she said. Maybe Canada is her next step. Or the Netherlands. Chitwood knows her work still matters and that it holds the power to help improve the health of people around the world, no matter where she lives.

Some of the most common words in these terminated grants included \u201chiv,\u201d \u201cbiomedical,\u201d \u201crisk\u201d and \u201cdisparities.\u201d READ MORE: READ MORE: NIH scientists publish letter criticizing Trump\u2019s deep cuts in public health research Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said during his May 14 testimony before the House Appropriations Committee, \u201cWe will fund cutting-edge research at the NIH while cutting risky or non-essential services.\u201d He added that the administration would \u201celiminate DEI funding and redirect resources toward real poverty reduction.\u201d When Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., asked why the Trump administration had cut $18 billion from NIH, Kennedy repeatedly said that if Congress appropriated the funds for NIH, he would spend those funds that were required by law. \u201cWe have!\u201d DeLauro shot back. Since Trump\u2019s second term began, some widely respected scholars have left the U.S., including philosopher and fascism expert Jason Stanley from Yale University. Many more are considering leaving, according to a March 27 survey published in the journal Nature. Among more than 1,600 U.S. scientists, three-quarters said they have thought about leaving the country. Many said they were looking at Europe and Canada. In school, Chitwood had learned about Europe\u2019s World War II-era \u201cbrain drain,\u201d including the downstream effects of those losses, such as less innovation in medical care. \u201cThere are real and lasting consequences here,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re standing on the precipice of that.\u201d Other nations are capitalizing on U.S. loss While the U.S. is pulling back on its investments in innovation and research, other nations are eager to gain advantages through attracting a highly skilled workforce. The European Union announced the Choose Europe for Science initiative last month, devoting 500 million euros in grant funding to attract American scientists and scholars to Europe, where they can continue their research unfettered by political agendas. This expanded on a program established in 2017 by French President Emmanuel Macron during the first Trump administration. \u201cThis is a call to all free minds who want to advance science and stand up for a certain model of society,\u201d Macron said at the May 5 announcement of the initiative at the Sorbonne University in Paris. The uncertainty that these cuts generate is devastating for young people on the cusp of starting their careers in research, Proctor said. Many \u201cidealistic people who want to change the world\u201d will be driven to the private sector, he added. David Paltiel, a professor of public health at Yale University, said he is near the end of his career and can fall back on savings if he needs to. \u201cI will be able to weather the storm,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m much more concerned about junior faculty who are just getting started.\u201d Chitwood never planned on leaving New England. Born and raised in Rhode Island, she said the family of her husband, a physician, lives in Boston. In the last year, they had been talking about buying a house, starting a family of their own and living close enough so grandparent visits would be easy and frequent. Those plans are now frozen as Chitwood and her husband work to figure out if they must uproot their lives and start again elsewhere. \u201cIf the goal is to root out anyone who thinks that diversity is good, that equity is good, that we should fight injustice, then what do I do?\u201d she said. Maybe Canada is her next step. Or the Netherlands. Chitwood knows her work still matters and that it holds the power to help improve the health of people around the world, no matter where she lives.

Strikes in and around Tehran The latest Israeli strikes hit a facility used to make uranium centrifuges and another that made missile components, the Israeli military said. It said it had intercepted 10 missiles overnight as Iran\u2019s retaliatory barrages diminish.

A Washington-based Iranian human rights group said at least 585 people, including 239 civilians, have been killed and more than 1,300 wounded. Iran has fired some 400 missiles and hundreds of drones in retaliatory strikes that have killed at least 24 people in Israel and wounded hundreds. Some have hit apartment buildings in central Israel, causing heavy damage, and air raid sirens have repeatedly forced Israelis to run for shelter. Iran has fired fewer missiles as the conflict has worn on. It has not explained the decline, but Israel has targeted launchers and other infrastructure related to the missiles. Casualties mount in Iran The Washington-based group Human Rights Activists said it had identified 239 of those killed in Israeli strikes as civilians and 126 as security personnel. The group, which also provided detailed casualty figures during 2022 protests over the death of Mahsa Amini, crosschecks local reports against a network of sources it has developed in Iran.

But in the days before the strikes began, he became convinced that Israel\u2019s heightened anxiety over Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment capabilities was warranted.\nAfter a pivotal briefing from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force Gen. Dan Caine, on Israel\u2019s plans and U.S. options for supporting its operation, he gave tacit approval to Israel to have at it and decided to provide limited U.S. backing.\nDeath toll in Israel rises to 24\nReporting from Tel Aviv\nAt least 24 people have been killed in Israel since Iran launched its retaliatory strikes, Netanyahu's office said today in a statement.

Israel\u2019s ongoing \u201cwidespread strikes\u201d in Tehran and elsewhere have left Iran\u2019s surviving leadership with the difficult decision of whether to plunge deeper into conflict with Israel\u2019s more powerful forces or seek a diplomatic route. WATCH: Middle East experts discuss what\u2019s next for the region as Israel-Iran conflict erupts Oman\u2019s foreign minister, Badr al-Busaidi, said on social media the sixth round of indirect nuclear talks on Sunday \u201cwill not now take place,\u201d adding that \u201cdiplomacy and dialogue remain the only pathway to lasting peace.\u201d Although the talks are off for now, \u201cwe remain committed to talks and hope the Iranians will come to the table soon,\u201d said a senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss diplomacy. Israel and Iran signaled more attacks are coming, despite urgent calls from world leaders to deescalate and avoid all-out war. The attack on nuclear sites set a \u201cdangerous precedent,\u201d China\u2019s foreign minister said. The region is already on edge as Israel makes a new push to eliminate the Iranian-backed militant group Hamas in Gaza after 20 months of fighting. Israel \u2014 widely believed to be the only nuclear-armed state in the Middle East \u2014 said its hundreds of strikes on Iran over the past two days killed a number of top generals, nine senior scientists and experts involved in Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Iran\u2019s U.N. ambassador has said 78 people were killed and more than 320 wounded. Iran retaliated by launching waves of drones and ballistic missiles at Israel, where explosions lit the night skies over Jerusalem and Tel Aviv and shook buildings. Israel said three people were killed and over 170 wounded. \u201cIf (Iranian Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali) Khamenei continues to fire missiles at the Israeli home front \u2014 Tehran will burn,\u201d Defense Minister Israel Katz said. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has made the destruction of Iran\u2019s nuclear program his top priority, said Israel\u2019s strikes so far are \u201cnothing compared to what they will feel under the sway of our forces in the coming days.\u201d In what could be another escalation if confirmed, semiofficial Iranian news agencies reported an Israeli drone struck and caused a \u201cstrong explosion\u201d at an Iranian natural-gas processing plant. It would be the first Israeli attack on Iran\u2019s oil and natural gas industry. Israel\u2019s military did not immediately comment. The extent of damage at the South Pars natural gas field was not immediately clear. Such sites have air defense systems around them, which Israel has been targeting. Iran calls nuclear talks \u2018unjustifiable\u2019 Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only, and U.S. intelligence agencies have assessed that Tehran was not actively pursuing the bomb. But its uranium enrichment has reached near weapons-grade levels, and on Thursday, the U.N.\u2019s atomic watchdog censured Iran for not complying with obligations meant to prevent it from developing a nuclear weapon. Iran\u2019s top diplomat said Saturday the nuclear talks were \u201cunjustifiable\u201d after Israel\u2019s strikes. Abbas Araghchi\u2019s comments came during a call with Kaja Kallas, the European Union\u2019s top diplomat. The Israeli airstrikes were the \u201cresult of the direct support by Washington,\u201d Araghchi said in a statement carried by the state-run IRNA news agency. The U.S. has said it isn\u2019t part of the strikes. On Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump urged Iran to reach a deal with the U.S. on its nuclear program, adding that \u201cIran must make a deal, before there is nothing left.\u201d U.S. helps to shoot down Iranian missiles Iran launched waves of missiles at Israel late Friday and early Saturday. Iranians awoke to state television airing repeated clips of the strikes, as well as videos of people cheering and handing out sweets.

WATCH: Israel hit with missiles as Iran retaliates for strikes on nuclear sites and leaders U.S. ground-based air defense systems in the region were helping to shoot down Iranian missiles, said a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the measures. In Ramat Gan, east of Tel Aviv, an Associated Press journalist saw burned-out cars and at least three damaged houses, including one whose front was nearly entirely torn away. Residents of a central Israeli city hit Friday night, Rishon Lezion, said the explosion was so powerful it shook their shelter door open. \u201cWe thought, that\u2019s it, the house is gone, and in fact half of the house was gone,\u201d said Moshe Shani. Israel\u2019s main international airport said it will remain closed until further notice. Indications of a new Israeli attack Israel\u2019s army spokesman, Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin, said Israel had attacked more than 400 targets across Iran, including 40 in Tehran, where dozens of fighter jets were \u201coperating freely.\u201d He said it was the deepest point Israel\u2019s air force had operated. Defrin said fighter jets struck over 40 \u201cmissile-related targets and advanced air defense array systems\u201d across Iran.

Gov. Bahram Sarmast\u2019s remarks were the latest acknowledgment of mass casualties. Iranian state television reported online that air defenses were firing in the cities of Khorramabad, Kermanshah and Tabriz. Footage from Tabriz showed black smoke rising. The sound of explosions and Iranian air defense systems firing at targets echoed across central Tehran. Iran\u2019s semiofficial Tasnim news agency reported a fire at Tehran\u2019s Mehrabad International Airport. \u2018More than a few weeks\u2019 to repair nuclear facilities Israel attacked Iran\u2019s main nuclear enrichment facility in Natanz. Satellite photos analyzed by AP show extensive damage there. The images shot Saturday by Planet Labs PBC show multiple buildings damaged or destroyed. The structures hit include buildings identified by experts as supplying power to the facility. U.N. nuclear chief Rafael Grossi told the Security Council that the above-ground section of the Natanz facility was destroyed. The main centrifuge facility underground did not appear to have been hit, but the loss of power could have damaged infrastructure there, he said. Israel said it also struck a nuclear research facility in Isfahan, including \u201cinfrastructure for enriched uranium conversion,\u201d and said it destroyed dozens of radar installations and surface-to-air missile launchers in western Iran. Iran confirmed the strike at Isfahan. The International Atomic Energy Agency said four \u201ccritical buildings\u201d at the Isfahan site were damaged, including its uranium conversion facility. \u201cAs in Natanz, no increase in off-site radiation expected,\u201d it added. An Israeli military official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with official procedures, said that according to the army\u2019s initial assessment \u201cit will take much more than a few weeks\u201d for Iran to repair the damage to the Natanz and Isfahan nuclear sites. The official said the army had \u201cconcrete intelligence that production in Isfahan was for military purposes.\u201d Israel denied it had struck the nuclear enrichment facility in Fordo, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) southeast of Tehran, after an Iranian news outlet close to the government reported the sound of explosions nearby. Netanyahu said the attack had been months in the making and was planned for April before being postponed. Among those killed were three of Iran\u2019s top military leaders: one who oversaw the entire armed forces, Gen. Mohammad Bagheri; one who led the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, Gen. Hossein Salami; and the head of the Guard\u2019s aerospace division, which oversees its arsenal of ballistic missile program, Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh.

Kennedy's new CDC panel includes members who have criticized vaccines and spread misinformation\nU.S. Health Secretary Robert F\nNEW YORK -- U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Wednesday named eight new vaccine policy advisers to replace the panel that he abruptly dismissed earlier this week.\nThey include a scientist who researched mRNA vaccine technology and became a conservative darling for his criticisms of COVID-19 vaccines, a leading critic of pandemic-era lockdowns, and a professor of operations management.\nKennedy's decision to \u201cretire\u201d the previous 17-member Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices was widely decried by doctors' groups and public health organizations, who feared the advisers would be replaced by a group aligned with Kennedy's desire to reassess \u2014 and possibly end \u2014 longstanding vaccination recommendations.\nOn Tuesday, before he announced his picks, Kennedy said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to bring great people onto the ACIP panel \u2013 not anti-vaxxers \u2013 bringing people on who are credentialed scientists.\u201d\nThe new appointees include Vicky Pebsworth, a regional director for the National Association of Catholic Nurses, who has been listed as a board member and volunteer director for the National Vaccine Information Center, a group that is widely considered to be a leading source of vaccine misinformation.\nAnother is Dr. Robert Malone, the former mRNA researcher who emerged as a close adviser to Kennedy during the measles outbreak. Malone, who runs a wellness institute and a popular blog, rose to prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic as he relayed conspiracy theories around the outbreak and the vaccines that followed. He has appeared on podcasts and other conservative news outlets where he\u2019s promoted unproven and alternative treatments for measles and COVID-19.\nHe has claimed that millions of Americans were hypnotized into taking the COVID-19 shots and has suggested that those vaccines cause a form of AIDS. He\u2019s downplayed deaths related to one of the largest measles outbreaks in the U.S. in years.\nOther appointees include Dr. Martin Kulldorff, a biostatistician and epidemiologist who was a co-author of the Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 letter maintaining that pandemic shutdowns were causing irreparable harm. Dr. Cody Meissner, a former ACIP member, also was named.\nAbram Wagner of the University of Michigan\u2019s school of public health, who investigates vaccination programs, said he\u2019s not satisfied with the composition of the committee.\n\u201cThe previous ACIP was made up of technical experts who have spent their lives studying vaccines,\u201d he said. Most people on the current list \u201cdon\u2019t have the technical capacity that we would expect out of people who would have to make really complicated decisions involving interpreting complicated scientific data.\u201d\nHe said having Pebsworth on the board is \u201cincredibly problematic\u201d since she is involved in an organization that \u201cdistributes a lot of misinformation.\u201d\nKennedy made the announcement in a social media post on Wednesday.\nThe committee, created in 1964, makes recommendations to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CDC directors almost always approve those recommendations on how vaccines that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration should be used. The CDC\u2019s final recommendations are widely heeded by doctors and guide vaccination programs.\nThe other appointees are:\n\u2014Dr. James Hibbeln, who formerly headed a National Institutes of Health group focused on nutritional neurosciences and who studies how nutrition affects the brain, including the potential benefits of seafood consumption during pregnancy.\n\u2014Retsef Levi, a professor of operations management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies business issues related to supply chain, logistics, pricing optimization and health and health care management. In a 2023 video pinned to an X profile under his name, Levi called for the end of the COVID-19 vaccination program, claiming the vaccines were ineffective and dangerous despite evidence they saved millions of lives.\n\u2014Dr. James Pagano, an emergency medicine physician from Los Angeles.\n\u2014Dr. Michael Ross, a Virginia-based obstetrician and gynecologist.\nOf the eight named by Kennedy, perhaps the most experienced in vaccine policy is Meissner, an expert in pediatric infectious diseases at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, who has previously served as a member of both ACIP and the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s vaccine advisory panel.\nDuring his five-year term as an FDA adviser, the committee was repeatedly asked to review and vote on the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines that were rapidly developed to fight the pandemic. In September 2021, he joined the majority of panelists who voted against a plan from the Biden administration to offer an extra vaccine dose to all American adults. The panel instead recommended that the extra shot should be limited to seniors and those at higher risk of the disease.\nUltimately, the FDA disregarded the panel\u2019s recommendation and OK\u2019d an extra vaccine dose for all adults.\nIn addition to serving on government panels, Meissner has helped author policy statements and vaccination schedules for the American Academy of Pediatrics.\nACIP members typically serve in staggered four-year terms, although several appointments were delayed during the Biden administration before positions were filled last year. The voting members all have scientific or clinical expertise in immunization, except for one \u201cconsumer representative\u201d who can bring perspective on community and social facets of vaccine programs.\nKennedy, a leading voice in the anti-vaccine movement before becoming the U.S. government\u2019s top health official, has accused the committee of being too closely aligned with vaccine manufacturers and of rubber-stamping vaccines. ACIP policies require members to state past collaborations with vaccine companies and to recuse themselves from votes in which they had a conflict of interest, but Kennedy has dismissed those safeguards as weak.\nMost of the people who best understand vaccines are those who have researched them, which usually requires some degree of collaboration with the companies that develop and sell them, said Jason Schwartz, a Yale University health policy researcher.\n\u201cIf you are to exclude any reputable, respected vaccine expert who has ever engaged even in a limited way with the vaccine industry, you\u2019re likely to have a very small pool of folks to draw from,\u201d Schwartz said.\nThe U.S. Senate confirmed Kennedy in February after he promised he would not change the vaccination schedule. But less than a week later, he vowed to investigate childhood vaccines that prevent measles, polio and other dangerous diseases.\nKennedy has ignored some of the recommendations ACIP voted for in April, including the endorsement of a new combination shot that protects against five strains of meningococcal bacteria and the expansion of vaccinations against RSV.\nIn late May, Kennedy disregarded the committee and announced the government would change the recommendation for children and pregnant women to get COVID-19 shots.\nOn Monday, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the ACIP, saying he would appoint a new group before the next scheduled meeting in late June.

Kennedy Jr. promised he would not discourage people from getting vaccines or make the shots \u201cdifficult\u201d to access.\nNow that the longtime anti-vaccine activist has the job, he\u2019s putting his promise to the test.\nIn the four months since GOP senators signed off on Kennedy\u2019s appointment as secretary of Health and Human Services, Kennedy has moved deliberately to upend the people and processes that have guided decision-making about vaccines.\nThis week, he purged a government panel of outside vaccine experts and appointed eight replacements, some of whom share his view that the government has covered up vaccine side effects. He skipped the advisory process in changing who the government says should get Covid vaccines and stoked confusion when he issued updated guidance that gave parents room to decide for themselves. He\u2019s hired an anti-vaccine activist to scour government records on vaccine safety and launched a search for autism\u2019s cause. Kennedy has long believed vaccines are one cause of the neurological disorder.\n\u201cIf we have a system that has been dismantled \u2014 one that allowed for open, evidence-based decision-making and that supported transparent and clear dialogue about vaccines \u2014 and then we replace it with a process that\u2019s driven largely by one person\u2019s beliefs, that creates a system that cannot be trusted,\u201d said Dr. Helen Chu, a University of Washington School of Medicine professor who was dismissed from the vaccine panel this week.\nIn the absence of independent, unbiased advice, she added, \u201cwe can\u2019t trust that safe and effective vaccines will be available for use in the United States.\u201d\nKennedy\u2019s sweeping moves in his first few months on the job underscore the broad mandate President Donald Trump gave him to remake the federal health department.\n\u201cSecretary Kennedy is restoring trust by demanding radical transparency and ending the complacency that defined past public health failures,\u201d HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon told POLITICO in a statement Thursday, noting that Kennedy\u2019s commitment to putting \u201caccountability and radical transparency first\u201d will \u201crestore trust in our public health system.\u201d\nKennedy has said his mission is to reestablish trust by rooting out corruption in the health agencies \u2014 stemming, he believes, from the symbiotic relationship between regulators and industry.\nBut leaders in the public health establishment say his actions are more likely to do the opposite, arguing he distorts scientific data to suit his message.\n\u201cWhat he\u2019s doing is undermining trust,\u201d said Tom Frieden, who led the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency.\nFrieden worries that Kennedy\u2019s hyper-skepticism about vaccine safety, which could be amplified now by like-minded members of his vaccine advisory panel, will mislead more people into believing the shots are unsafe, causing immunization rates to dip and infectious diseases to spread.\nKennedy\u2019s belief that vaccines often carry serious side effects already has led to policy change, with HHS dropping guidance that pregnant women get vaccinated for Covid. HHS cited evidence that the shot was linked to miscarriages \u2014 though one of the researchers footnoted in an HHS document disputed the agency\u2019s characterization. Thirty-two medical groups protested the decision earlier this week.\nAmong the new members of the vaccine advisory panel are Dr. Robert Malone and Retsef Levi, who share Kennedy\u2019s view that Covid vaccine side effects are more serious than the government has disclosed.\nThe changes Kennedy has made, public health experts warn, are upending the nation\u2019s health agencies and risk paralyzing decision-making about what advice to give the public.\nBut to Kennedy\u2019s supporters, he\u2019s just doing what Trump asked him to do.\n\u201cFrankly, the experts really got an awful lot wrong about Covid in particular, so I think in general the American population right now is pretty darn skeptical of the so-called experts,\u201d said Mary Holland, president and general counsel at Children\u2019s Health Defense, the anti-vaccine nonprofit Kennedy founded.\nAn unprecedented move\nThe vaccine panel Kennedy has upended, the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, is one of four external panels housed at HHS that advise agencies on vaccine policy, but it\u2019s regarded as the most influential.\nThe panel helps set the CDC\u2019s childhood and adult immunization schedules, and several state and federal laws reference ACIP recommendations \u2014 including the Affordable Care Act, which requires health plans to cover vaccines the committee recommends for routine use without cost-sharing. ACIP also votes on whether vaccines should be offered through the Vaccines for Children program that ensures low-income and under- and uninsured kids can access shots for free.\n\u201cIf the secretary puts in place an advisory committee that shares his views around vaccination \u2026 I can envision the committee not making recommendations for vaccine use in children, or revisiting the existing schedule and changing some of those recommendations,\u201d Dr. Richard Besser, a former CDC acting director who\u2019s now president and CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, told POLITICO Tuesday. \u201cWe would be in a situation where your ability to get a vaccine depends on how much money is in your pocket.\u201d\nThe demise of an independent ACIP, Chu said, would lead to \u201ca patchwork of different policies by different states\u201d \u2014 a development that could see some states stop mandating certain vaccines for school entry and likely increasing the risk of infectious disease.\nHistorically, the CDC director decides whether to accept, reject or amend the group\u2019s recommendations, but it\u2019s unclear whether anyone is filling that role.\nDr. Susan Monarez, a former Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health official, was tapped to lead the CDC, compelling her to step down as acting director. Kennedy told lawmakers in May that agency chief of staff Matthew Buzzelli \u2014 a lawyer with no public health background \u2014 was in charge.\nEven Holland called the absence of a confirmed CDC director \u201ctroubling\u201d and questioned whether the Senate is prioritizing the position.\nIf approved, Monarez would be the first confirmed CDC director since Congress changed the law in 2023 to require the Senate to vote on the position. The Office of Government Ethics posted her financial disclosure forms on Saturday, which clears the way for the Senate health panel to schedule a confirmation hearing.\nACIP voting members usually serve four-year terms \u2014 and STAT has reported that the Biden administration intentionally stacked the committee\u2019s membership, selecting replacements for members whose terms were set to expire in June.\nEven so, Kennedy\u2019s decision to fire all of the panel\u2019s members and replace them is unprecedented. The HHS secretary wields broad authority to manage the panel as he sees fit under federal law.\nAnd the slate he announced late Wednesday includes several people known for questioning the safety of either messenger RNA vaccines specifically or, more broadly, the childhood schedule.\nDr. Jeffrey Klausner, a former public health official in California, has informally advised Kennedy since the November election, including compiling a list of names for new ACIP members who he thought would balance public health imperatives with vaccine safety concerns. None of his suggestions made the cut so far, he told POLITICO.\n\u201cMost people don\u2019t understand there are very different ethics in the practice of public health. In medicine, it\u2019s all about \u2018do no harm,\u2019 and it\u2019s about advocating as much as one can for the benefit of that individual patient,\u201d Klausner said. \u201cIn public health, you\u2019re trying to do the most good for the most people.\u201d\nKennedy said the new members will \u201creview safety and efficacy data for the current schedule,\u201d raising questions about how the new panel may seek to change recommendations relied upon by pediatricians nationwide.\n\u201cI\u2019m very disappointed. Not so much for me, but for public health,\u201d said Mysheika W. Roberts, health commissioner for Columbus, Ohio, who was slated to join ACIP in July, replacing one of the members whose terms was set to expire. \u201cHow are we going to make sure we have individuals at the table who can make decisions that impact everyone in our country, and really make those decisions based on proper data and proper science?\u201d\nChoice vs. obligation\nThe firing of the vaccine advisers is only Kennedy\u2019s most recent effort to remake HHS\u2019 administrative structure in his image.\nIt follows his decision to launch a search for autism\u2019s cause \u2014 he\u2019s putting $50 million into it and promising answers within months \u2014 and his cancellation of a nearly $600 million contract with Covid shotmaker Moderna to use its mRNA platform to develop a bird flu vaccine. Kennedy has called the mRNA Covid shots from Moderna and Pfizer the \u201cdeadliest vaccine ever made.\u201d\nAt the same time, Kennedy and the vaccine-wary wing of his Make America Healthy Again movement have elevated the once-fringe view that vaccination should be an individual choice and not a public obligation.\nKennedy has made the point repeatedly in congressional testimony and in his response to an ongoing measles outbreak. He has said he believes reassuring Americans that vaccination is up to them, and not required, is essential to restoring trust in public health after vaccine mandates drew backlash during the pandemic.\nBut Kennedy\u2019s perception of \u201cevidence-based decision-making with objectivity and common sense\u201d \u2014 the approach he said the vaccine advisory panel\u2019s new roster would take \u2014 runs contrary to that of most scientists. They see vaccination as one of the most important public health interventions to limit and prevent disease spread, along with clean water, and believe it essential that people feel an obligation, if not a requirement, to get vaccinated.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the rise of individualism going against collective good, and public health DNA is public good \u2014 it\u2019s protecting the population to protect the most vulnerable,\u201d said Katelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist who\u2019s consulted for the CDC. \u201cThat\u2019s just a very different framework in theory than the medical freedom movement, and how you reconcile those two things in this moment is the big question.\u201d\nWhile Klausner said he\u2019s disappointed with Kennedy\u2019s ACIP choices, he\u2019ll continue to offer the secretary advice because he\u2019s in the position of authority.\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to work with him to keep things on the rails,\u201d he said.", "Health secretary RFK Jr. abruptly fires CDC vaccine advisory panel. Health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has taken the extraordinary step of firing the expert panel that advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on immunizations, saying the action is needed to restore faith in vaccines.\n\u201cA clean sweep is needed to re-establish public confidence in vaccine science,\u201d Kennedy said in an op-ed published Monday afternoon in the Wall Street Journal.\nProponents of vaccines have feared Kennedy, who is openly skeptical of vaccines and has long been critical of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, might take such a step. ACIP studies vaccines in the regulatory pipeline and ones that have recently been licensed by the Food and Drug Administration, advising the CDC on who they should be offered to once they have been approved.\nAppointing replacement members to the advisory panel would give Kennedy broad latitude to reshape the government\u2019s childhood immunization schedule and other vaccines advice. New members haven\u2019t yet been named, but it would appear they may have been selected, because a statement from Kennedy\u2019s department said that a meeting scheduled for late June will take place. In normal times, ACIP candidates go through a vetting process that can take upward of a year.\n\u201cWe have just demonstrated that politics will overrun science in this administration. It scares me to think of what\u2019s ahead,\u201d said Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota\u2019s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.\nOne of the fired members of the committee, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, was floored by the move. The committee members were not informed in advance, the individual said. Later in the day, they received an unsigned email informing them of their immediate termination. \u201cWe appreciate your prior service and commitment,\u201d it concluded.\nThe committee member predicted upheaval in vaccination policy going forward.\n\u201cProviders are no longer going to follow the CDC [vaccination] schedule,\u201d the individual predicted. \u201cThe CDC has lost credibility in the vaccination space. \u2026 It adds a lot of uncertainty for care for children and adults.\u201d\nBill Cassidy (R-La.), the Republican chair of the Senate\u2019s health committee, expressed grave concerns about Kennedy\u2019s anti-vaccine positions during his confirmation hearing, before ultimately voting to confirm him. He said on the social media site X that he\u2019d spoken with Kennedy on Monday and is working to ensure the panel won\u2019t be filled with people \u201cwho know nothing about vaccines except suspicion.\u201d\nSen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) called the decision to purge ACIP \u201cexcessive.\u201d\n\u201cI think these vaccines and other advisory committees are very helpful to the public in providing guidance,\u201d she said. \u201cSo to cancel all of the people \u2026 that raises serious questions.\u201d\nThe ACIP meets three times a year \u2014 more often during emergencies like the Covid-19 pandemic \u2014 to review data on vaccines and recommend how they should be used. Their recommendations must be approved by the CDC director \u2014 the position is currently unfilled \u2014 or the HHS secretary to go into practice. Kennedy has not signed on to three recommendations the ACIP made at its last meeting in April.\nRichard Hughes, a lawyer with the firm Epstein Becker Green, warned that vaccination policy that is science-based appears to be on the verge of becoming a thing of the past.\n\u201cThis upends 61 years of thoughtful, evidence-based decision-making,\u201d Hughes, who once worked at the vaccine manufacturer Moderna, told STAT in an email. \u201cAt a minimum, it means the involvement of new members will introduce misinformation into what has been a science-based forum.\u201d\nBruce Gellin, a former director of the HHS National Vaccine Program Office, shared that concern.\n\u201cWhat we learned in Epidemiology 101 about confirmation bias was better said by John Steinbeck in \u2018The Winter of Our Discontent\u2019 \u2014 \u2018You know how advice is \u2014 you only want it if it agrees with what you wanted to do anyway,\u2019\u201d Gellin said. \u201cAll eyes will be on the advice the new advisory committee members provide.\u201d\nPaul Offit, a former member of the committee and one of the developers of a vaccine that protects against rotavirus infection, said the committee\u2019s work over decades has markedly improved the health of children and adults in this country. \u201cThey should be given an award, not fired,\u201d said Offit, an infectious diseases pediatrician at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia.\n\u201cRFK Jr. has for 20 years shown you who he is. And nothing has happened since he\u2019s been secretary of HHS to make you feel any differently,\u201d Offit added.\nMany public health officials expressed deep concern about what ACIP will become and what the decision will mean for the credibility of vaccine recommendations that emerge from the CDC. Tom Frieden, a former director of the CDC, was among them. \u201cWe\u2019ll look back at this as a grave mistake that sacrificed decades of scientific rigor, undermined public trust, and opened the door for fringe theories rather than facts to guide the recommendations that doctors rely on to protect patients,\u201d he said in a statement.\nThe step followed reporting from STAT on Sunday that revealed that four members of the 17-person panel had received termination notices because their special government employee contracts had lapsed.\nIn addition to firing all 17 sitting members of the panel, Kennedy terminated the appointments of several experts who had been approved to join the ACIP in July to replace members whose terms were expiring. Before leaving office, former health secretary Xavier Becerra and his team filled all open and upcoming vacancies on the ACIP to try to protect the group\u2019s scientific integrity.\nKennedy\u2019s move appears to fly in the face of commitments he made to Cassidy when being confirmed to lead HHS. At the time, Kennedy promised to maintain ACIP recommendations without creating a new safety system, Cassidy said then.\n\u201cIf confirmed, he will maintain the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices without changes,\u201d Cassidy said in a floor speech.\nAsked by a reporter on Monday about this commitment, Cassidy responded that Kennedy promised not to touch \u201cthe process\u201d of vaccine approval.\nWriting in the Journal, Kennedy argued that he was acting to restore confidence in America\u2019s public health leadership, saying the Biden administration stacked the committee, and portraying the group as a rubber stamp for approvals riddled with conflicts of interest.\nThe Biden administration approved eight new candidates to the committee just before leaving office, with some former officials saying the move was intended to keep the Trump administration from removing mainstream scientific expertise. The HHS statement about Kennedy\u2019s decision cited that aim as a reason for firing all sitting members.\nAnd though some outside experts say ACIP could have stronger conflict of interest policies, they have said Kennedy\u2019s assessment is incomplete at best. In announcing the ACIP firings, Kennedy said the committee members aren\u2019t necessarily corrupt. \u201cThe problem is their immersion in a system of industry-aligned incentives and paradigms that enforce a narrow pro-industry orthodoxy,\u201d he wrote.\nKennedy\u2019s critics have pointed to the conflicts he brings to the discussion about vaccines. He\u2019s spent years leading a nonprofit that argued \u2014 without evidence \u2014 that vaccines are linked to autism, signed book deals to question the safety and efficacy of shots, and received fees for referring plaintiffs who say they were injured by vaccines. (Kennedy pledged to withdraw from his previous business dealings when taking the helm of HHS, though he refused to promise to not sue vaccine manufacturers after his tenure.)\nHis history could make boosting trust in the CDC difficult. Even Kennedy\u2019s allies have acknowledged that trust can only be restored if the vast majority of Americans \u2014 including those who disagree with him \u2014 believe the systems are not being changed for political reasons. The move to remake ACIP will weaken trust in the system, public health leaders said.\nThe president of the American Medical Association, Bruce Scott, said the action \u201cundermines that trust and upends a transparent process that has saved countless lives. With an ongoing measles outbreak and routine child vaccination rates declining, this move will further fuel the spread of vaccine-preventable illnesses.\u201d\nThe MAHA PAC run by Kennedy allies, which is pouring money into state races and issues, posted on X, \u201cThe MAHA Revolution is finally here. \u2026 The truth about vaccines is about to be EXPOSED.\u201d\nChildren\u2019s Health Defense, the vaccine-criticizing nonprofit Kennedy founded, and the anti-vaccine activist Sherri Tenpenny were similarly upbeat about the news. \u201cThis is unprecedented. And long overdue. The foundation is shaking. Keep your eyes open,\u201d Tenpenny posted on X, alongside a link to a news article.\n\u201cHope the good news continues,\u201d CHD responded. The group has for years alleged that conflicts of interest, such as grant funding from companies that make vaccines, skewed ACIP recommendations toward approving certain shots. Tenpenny, an osteopathic physician who had her license revoked, then reinstated, during the pandemic, has been named in at least one of Kennedy\u2019s books as a hero for \u201cmedical freedom.\u201d She, like others, pushed back on vaccination mandates and alleged Covid vaccines make people magnetic. (They do not.)\nCritics of Kennedy\u2019s aggressive anti-vaccines stands have been readying themselves for something of this nature. Osterholm\u2019s center, CIDRAP, recently launched what it has called the Vaccine Integrity Project, led by high-level figures including former Food and Drug Administration commissioner Margaret Hamburg, and Harvey Fineberg, a former president of the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine).\n\u201cWe take up the Vaccine Integrity Project as a precautionary step,\u201d the two wrote in an opinion piece published in STAT in April. \u201cShould ACIP or FDA processes or scientific evaluation become compromised, America cannot afford to be left without any organized systems to ensure that evidence grounded in science continues to guide decisions about the use of vaccines.\u201d\nIsabella Cueto and John Wilkerson contributed reporting.\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated 19 members of the ACIP had been fired. There were only 17 sitting members, all of whom were fired."]}, {"topic": 2, "name": "Louisiana campaign finance law", "keywords": "louisiana, st, to, llc, and, bill, orleans, board, state, the", "documents": ["Louisiana political campaigns might get to withhold more donation, spending info. 6:31\nNews Story\nLouisiana political campaigns might get to withhold more donation, spending info\nMatthew Perschall/Louisiana Illuminator\nLouisiana lawmakers might diminish information available to the public about political donations and election spending through a sprawling rewrite of the state\u2019s campaign finance law.\nGov. Jeff Landry is pushing House Bill 693, sponsored by House Republican Caucus Chairman Mark Wright, R-Covington. It carves out more circumstances under which political contributions and expenditures don\u2019t have to be disclosed on a public campaign finance report.\nThe 101-page proposal is difficult to understand for people who don\u2019t deal with campaign finance regulations frequently. Even staff attorneys for the Louisiana Board of Ethics, which enforces the campaign finance laws, admit the changes are confusing.\n\u201cTo be honest with you, it\u2019s going to take quite a grace period to figure all this out,\u201d Ethics Administrator David Bordelon said when presenting the bill to the state ethics board last month.\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\nPrivate attorneys Stephen Gel\u00e9 and Charles Spies helped write the bill. They have represented Landry in multiple disputes he has had with the ethics board, including over campaign finance laws and enforcement.\nGel\u00e9 has said the proposal respects constitutional rights, including freedom of speech, while still providing transparency and \u201cpreventing the appearance of corruption.\u201d\nThe state\u2019s preeminent government watchdog group disagrees. The Public Affairs Research Council of Louisiana (PAR) has come out against the legislation, saying the bill would benefit politicians while offering little for the general public.\n\u201cThere is a very large bill, and I don\u2019t quite understand the problem it is trying to solve,\u201d PAR President Steven Procopio said at a legislative hearing last month.\nThe Louisiana House voted to approve the legislation on a 77-16 vote last month. The Senate will start taking up the bill Wednesday, and both chambers need to pass it by the end of the legislative session on June 12.\nIn more than 20 places in the law, the bill increases the minimum dollar threshold at which a donation or expense has to be included on a public campaign finance report.\nFor example, national political committees that raise most of their money outside Louisiana are required to publicly disclose their spending on a Louisiana election once it reaches $20,000. The proposed bill would hike that disclosure threshold to $50,000.\nThe current law also requires any campaign contributions or expenditures over $200 given within the 20 days before the election to be reported on a public campaign finance report. The proposed law would hike that disclosure threshold to $5,000.\nLouisiana set to spend at least $7 million to bring Saudi-owned LIV Golf to New Orleans\nOver a dozen similar changes are also part of the legislation.\nIndividuals who are not political candidates and groups that are not explicitly political committees could also spend money on an election without disclosing contributions they accepted for the politicking.\nThose who are not a candidate or a designated political committee would only be required to disclose election spending over $1,000 in a political cycle and if it involved:\n- federally-regulated broadcast media;\n- 500 pieces of mail;\n- a phone bank of 500 calls within a 30-day period; or\n- digital or print advertising with a candidate\u2019s image that\u2019s distributed in the area the candidate would represent within 30 days of their primary and 60 days of their general election\nThese changes would apply to large, statewide elections and smaller ones such as those for police juries, town councils and school boards.\nMoney spent to communicate with people in a \u201cmembership organization\u201d \u2013 such as a union, industry association or an athletic club \u2013 as well as employees and stockholders of a business also would not have to be reported as a political expense. This could include communication sent to thousands of people at once.\nIn some cases, current campaign finance law obliges people to report this type of spending that would be shielded under the Wright bill. But supporters of the legislation said these exceptions were mainly carved out with so-called social welfare organizations, which already aren\u2019t required to disclose their donors, in mind.\nThe organizations, which critics call \u201cdark money\u201d political groups, are registered with the IRS as 501(c)(4) nonprofits for tax purposes and can keep their contributors private under federal regulations. It\u2019s unclear to what extent the groups have to disclose their spending on Louisiana elections under current state campaign finance laws.\nLandry has set up at least one of these \u201cdark money\u201d groups, Protect Louisiana Values, to advance his political agenda. It also notably put up the money for Landry to rent a live tiger to attend an LSU football game last year.\nDefying Landry, Louisiana lawmakers reject giving him more control over licensing boards\nFormer Gov. John Bel Edwards also established two of his own \u201cdark money\u201d groups during his eight years in office: Rebuild Louisiana and A Stronger Louisiana.\nWhile limiting disclosure on political spending, Wright\u2019s legislation does open up allowable uses of politician\u2019s campaign funds to a much wider group of expenses, including their home mortgages, country club fees and gym memberships.\nThe legislation is also one of a few bills Landry is pushing to soften ethics laws and regulations this session. Lawmakers in favor of them said they are reacting to overzealous enforcement by the ethics board.\nIn 2007, former Gov. Bobby Jindal and legislators passed dozens of restrictions and public disclosure requirements for elected officials and public employees as part of Jindal\u2019s effort to reach a \u201cgold standard\u201d of ethics for Louisiana that would be a model around the country.\nLawmakers are now saying that effort was overreach that needs to be corrected.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t come across an elected official who has enjoyed working through this process and hasn\u2019t questioned what they did back in the Jindal era,\u201d Wright said of ethics and campaign finance regulations.\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

Jeff Landry addresses the Louisiana Legislature on opening day of legislative session, Monday, April 14, 2025, at the Louisiana State Capitol in Baton Rouge. (Hilary Scheinuk/The Advocate-Pool)\nLouisiana lawmakers adjourned the 2025 regular lawmaking session Thursday having passed a budget with hundreds of millions of dollars in infrastructure spending; bills aimed at lowering insurance races; and a massive rewrite of state ethics laws.\nIn its early days, the eight-week session was at first dominated by a battle between insurance companies and the personal injury attorneys over how to lower car insurance rates.\nThat policy dispute also led to a showdown between Insurance Commissioner Tim Temple and Gov. Jeff Landry, both Republicans, over who should be held responsible for Louisiana\u2019s sky-high insurance costs.\nAt the end of the session, the governor engaged in a power struggle with Senate President Cameron Henry over private school vouchers and prescription drug regulations.\nThe following list evaluates how certain political figures and causes fared in the lawmaking session:\nWINNER: Senate President Cameron Henry\nHenry, a Metairie Republican, resisted pressure from Landry and the conservative House to push through more radical policy proposals than he said the Senate, which has a more moderate approach to politics, felt uncomfortable adopting.\nDespite a wave of attack ads in the media and pressure from the governor, Henry refused to fund an expansion of Louisiana\u2019s private education voucher program. He also declined to force a Senate vote on a proposal to radically remake Louisiana\u2019s pharmacy network, in spite of social media threats from Landry to force a vote on the issue.\nThe Senate president blocked a ban on diversity, equity and inclusion policies that the House endorsed. His chamber also turned down a proposal from Landry to give the governor more control over licensing boards and commissions.\nTOSS-UP: Gov. Jeff Landry\nAs noted above, Landry lost a couple of high-profile legislative fights with the Senate over his signature private education voucher initiative and prescription drug regulations.\nSome of his strong-arm tactics also simply weren\u2019t effective at getting his agenda passed, particularly in the Senate.\nLandry\u2019s public rally with school children that was meant to pressure legislators into funding more vouchers didn\u2019t elicit the response he wanted. The ultimatum he issued to call lawmakers back into a special session also didn\u2019t force the Senate into passing the pharmacy bill he was backing.\nOn other fronts however, he had legislative victories. He was largely able to get his agenda to address Louisiana\u2019s car insurance crisis through the Legislature. A number of bills that reworked the way state agencies \u2013 including the Louisiana Workforce Commission, Department of Transportation and Development and the Department of Children and Family Services \u2013 function also passed.\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\nLOSER: Government transparency\nLawmakers approve a handful of bills that will make it difficult to scrutinize government officials for inappropriate behavior, government corruption and conflicts of interest.\nHouse Bill 681 by Rep. Marcus Bryant, D-New Iberia, could subject people to jail time and fines if they post personal information about state lawmakers, statewide elected officials and Public Service Commissioners on the internet.\nIt prevents the elected officials\u2019 home addresses, phone numbers, personal email addresses, Social Security numbers, driver\u2019s license numbers, federal tax identification numbers, bank account numbers, credit and debit card numbers, license plate numbers from being published in government records or on a public website. Also protected under the law are marital records and birthdates.\nAn official\u2019s church, the school or daycare their child attends and the employment location of their spouse, children or dependents would also be shielded.\nTwo other pieces of legislation that massively write government ethics and campaign finance laws would also lead to less disclosure of who is donating to and spending money on political campaigns.\nWINNER: Government corruption\nAlong with weakening public transparency laws, Landry and lawmakers have made it harder for the Louisiana Board of Ethics to charge any elected official, public employee or government contractor with wrongdoing.\nThe change to the board\u2019s investigative process may simply allow those accused of wrongdoing to run out the clock on the board\u2019s ability to even bring charges against them, according to the board\u2019s own members.\nThe board is only given a year to investigate and charge a person with a violation before it reaches a legal deadline to do so. The new process for investigations is more time consuming and will make it difficult to finish on time, board members said.\nLOSER: Insurance Commissioner Tim Temple\nTemple successfully pushed most of his legislative agenda through, but he lost a public feud to fellow Republican Landry over a bill that would allow the governor to cast blame onto him for the state\u2019s insurance crisis. He will now have greater authority to reject insurance rate hikes, a responsibility he doesn\u2019t want to have. He will now be open to criticism when he doesn\u2019t turn down rate increases that are not popular with the public.\nWINNER: Insurance industry\nInsurance companies are the real winners of Temple\u2019s agenda of \u201ctort reform\u201d bills they have been trying to get on the books for years. The new laws are supposed to tamp down lawsuits and reduce the amount of money plaintiffs can recover from bodily injury accidents.\nLOSERS: Carbon capture critics\nCarbon capture and sequestration made a cozy home for itself in Louisiana this session. Bills attempting to assert local control over where and whether projects to store injected carbon dioxide underground happen largely died in committees.\nOther moves to ban the practice entirely or tax CO2 injection also got little love. Surviving CCS measures that made it into law are provisions restricting the use of eminent domain for CO2 storage transport pipelines and keeping court venues for these eminent domain claims local to the parish in question.\nWINNER: Rep. Dustin Miller\nMiller, an Opelousas Democrat, holds a key seat as chairman of the House Committee on Health and Welfare in a legislature where Republicans hold the supermajority. One of his bills was amended in the late stages of the session to prohibit companies from owning both drugstores and pharmacy benefit managers in Louisiana. Although the legislation was denied a final vote in the Senate on the last day of the session, Miller still received a bipartisan standing ovation from his colleagues in the House for his effort.\nHe did manage to finesse an exclusion for his home city in one of the year\u2019s most contested bills. A statewide ban on speeding enforcement cameras everywhere but school zones will take effect Aug. 1, except in Opelousas.\nWINNERS: Public school teachers\nLandry and lawmakers had initially said they would not give public school teachers another $2,000 pay stipend after a constitutional amendment to provide that money permanently failed to pass in March. They quickly backtracked, however, and ended up putting the teacher\u2019s stipend back into the budget for the 2025-2026 school year.\nThe lawmakers are also putting another constitutional amendment on the ballot next year that would raise teacher pay slightly if the voters approve it. Teachers and school support staff would get $2,250 and $1,125 more respectively in their permanent pay if the ballot proposition passes.\nThe teachers also successfully fought off legislation that would have made it harder for their unions to collect dues that are automatically deducted from paychecks.\nLOSERS: Abortion medication providers\nDoctors and activists who provide abortion-inducing medications to Louisianians could be sued under a proposal approved by lawmakers.\nHouse Bill 575 by Rep. Lauren Ventrella, R-Greenwell Springs, easily passed both chambers. She dubbed her proposal the \u201cJustice for Victims of Abortion Drug Dealers Act,\u201d though it would apply to all forms of the procedure.\nIn addition to allowing out-of-state providers to be sued, it extends the window for filing litigation from three years to five.\nTOSS-UP: College athletes\nLouisiana college athletes will not be receiving a tax exemption on their name, image and likeness (NIL) income this year, as two proposals to do so stalled due to the state\u2019s lean budget situation. But lawmakers may take another crack at it after a task force meets over the next year and submits recommendations for NIL legislation.\nBut each Division I college athletics program in Louisiana will be the beneficiary of an increased gambling tax, which will send nearly $2 million annually to be spent on expenses benefitting athletes.\nWINNERS: Nursing home owners\nNursing home owners were able to pass legislation that will limit the damages collected from wrongful death and injury lawsuits brought against their facilities. There are 60-plus pending lawsuits from former clients and their families against nursing home ownership groups across the state currently.\nLOSERS: Civil service workers\nLawmakers approved a constitutional amendment that could weaken the state civil service system that provides protections to thousands of state employees. The proposal still needs approval from Louisiana voters before it\u2019s enacted, but the fact that the bill made it out of the legislature this year signals that a two-thirds majority of lawmakers may no longer value a system that has held strong in Louisiana for roughly 70 years.\nWINNERS: DEI and academic freedom\nA proposal that would have prohibited diversity, equity and inclusion practices across state government and prohibit state universities and colleges from requiring certain race and gender-based curricula for undergraduate students was purposefully stalled in the Senate.\nHenry, the senate president, said the measure was unnecessary.\nThe bill was also opposed by The Louisiana chapter of the American Association of University Professors.\nLOSERS: People incarcerated on split-jury verdicts\nLouisiana voters amended the state constitution in 2018 to eliminate convictions through non-unanimous juries in felony criminal trials, but the change didn\u2019t apply to such verdicts before the change. Two years later, U.S. Supreme Court ruled that split-jury verdicts were unconstitutional, but it left it up to Louisiana to determine whether their ruling would apply to older cases.\nLawmakers have tried multiple times since then to provide an avenue for those convicted by non-unanimous juries to seek a review of their cases. Sen. Royce Duplessis, D-New Orleans, managed to get his bill through committee this year, but it was shot down on the Senate floor despite having the support of the Louisiana Republican Party and GOP Congressman Clay Higgins, an ardent anti-crime proponent.\nWINNER: Children\u2019s teeth\nLouisiana lawmakers opted against a conspiracy-theory fueled bill that would have prohibited public water systems from fluoridating their water. Water fluoridation is considered key in reducing dental complications in children.\nLOSER: Wetlands\nIt is now easier to build in Louisiana\u2019s isolated wetland areas\u2014 kind of. The state adopted a new definition of what counts as a wetland with Senate Bill 94 by Senator Mike \u201cBig Mike\u201d Fesi, R-Houma, excluding areas cut off from surface water connection to rivers and lakes or surrounded by levees.\nDespite some legal confusion as to whether the legislation violates the Clean Water Act, there are now legal avenues to argue that these isolated wetland areas don\u2019t need permits to drain, dredge and fill.\nWINNER: Fortified roof program\nLawmakers have embraced the state\u2019s fortified roof program as one of the only effective means of lowering homeowner insurance rates. This session, they established a new $10,000 income tax credit that should go a significant way in helping homeowners afford the hurricane-resistant roofs.\nWINNER: Saudi Arabia\nLouisiana has included $7 million in the state budget to spend on a LIV Golf League event that is expected to come to the Bayou Oaks golf course in New Orleans City Park next summer.\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund, which is one of the largest sovereign wealth funds in the world with nearly $1 trillion in assets, owns LIV Golf.\nLOSER: Science\nThe governor has signed a bill that bans the dispersion of chemicals for weather modification. Technological advances in have safely produced results in rain-starved areas, but they have also launched far more unsubstantiated conspiracy theories. Louisiana joins Florida and Tennessee with new laws based on this speculation, and similar legislation is under consideration in other states.\nAwaiting the governor\u2019s signature is a bill that would allow the over-the-counter sale of ivermectin. The drug\u2019s proponents praise it as a treatment for COVID-19 symptoms, though federal regulators haven\u2019t approved it for that use.\nJulie O\u2019Donoghue, Piper Hutchinson, Wes Muller, Elise Plunk and Greg LaRose contributed to this analysis\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

ICE reported 11 arrests of people working at the port who did not have legal status to be in the United States (Photo courtesy of ICE).\nTwo controversial state bills in the Louisiana Legislature \u2014 both designed to aid federal and state crackdowns on immigration \u2014 are in the final stages of becoming law after passing overwhelmingly in the state House of Representatives Monday.\nWith days to go in the spring legislative session, Louisiana\u2019s House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly in favor of Senate Bill 100, which requires agencies to track undocumented immigrants who receive state services, and Senate Bill 15, which makes it a crime for law enforcement agents, and others, to refuse to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement agencies. The session is set to adjourn on Thursday.\nThe bills both advance the priorities of Gov. Jeff Landry, a conservative immigration hardliner and ally of President Donald Trump.\nSenate Bill 100, sponsored by Sen. Blake Miguez, R-New Iberia, which requires service providing public agencies \u2013 including the state Department of Education, Department of Corrections and the Department of Children & Family Services \u2013 to collect data and report to the State on the immigration status of people who receive those services. It passed 74-27 Monday afternoon.\nSenate Bill 15, sponsored by Sen. Jay Morris, R-West Monroe, criminalizes the failure of local officials \u2013 including sheriffs and other law enforcement officers \u2013 to cooperate with federal immigration agencies, with penalties of up to 10 years in prison. It also criminalizes acts by everyday Louisiana residents deemed to obstruct or \u201cthwart\u201d federal immigration enforcement efforts. It passed 71-30.\nIf Senate Bill 15 becomes law, it would directly conflict with immigration policies adopted by the Orleans Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office and, potentially, the New Orleans Police Department, both of which are under federal orders to limit their cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal immigration agencies.\nBoth have already passed the Senate. SB100 will now head back to the Senate for Senate President Cameron Henry\u2019s signature and then to Landry\u2019s desk for his signature.\nSenate Bill 15, however, was amended in the House before final passage. The Senate will have to vote to approve the amended version before it can move on to become law.\nAdvocates against the pieces of legislation say the bills, once effected, will push Louisiana\u2019s immigrant community into the shadows.\n\u201cWith the passage of SB 100 and SB 15, our state has sent a chilling message: that Immigrant families and anyone seeking safety or services are seen as expendable.\u201d said Tia Fields, who manages policy for advocacy group Louisianan Organization for Refugees and Immigrants in Baton Rouge. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: these bills aren\u2019t about public safety. They\u2019re about punishment.\u201d\nSenate Bill 15\nIf enacted, Senate Bill 15 will be the first state law in the U.S. that criminalizes interference with immigration enforcement efforts, considered to be civil matters, or refusals to cooperate with federal immigration agencies.\nDuring debate on the House Floor on Monday Rep. Candace Newell, D-New Orleans, repeatedly asked how the Orleans Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office would follow the law, which directly contradicts an agency policy that was created under federal court order.\nThe bill requires jailers, including sheriffs, to honor administrative requests from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to hold an immigrant beyond their release date from jail so that they can be brought into ICE custody.\nBut a Sheriff\u2019s Office policy prohibits the agency from honoring hold requests except in cases where a jail detainee is accused of a particularly serious crime. The policy exists as the result of a 2013 federal court settlement stemming from a 2011 civil rights case in which two men said they were illegally held in the city\u2019s jail for months at the request of ICE. Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill, another immigration hardliner, is challenging that settlement agreement.\nLouisiana already has a law, Act 314 of 2024 \u2013 enacted through Senate Bill 208, sponsored by Miguez and passed last year \u2013 that blocks local law enforcement agencies from adopting so-called \u201dsanctuary\u201d like the one at the Orleans Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office. But unlike Senate Bill 15 \u2014 which calls for prison sentences of up to 10 years \u2014 that is a civil law, carrying no jail time for failure to comply.\n\u201cThe Orleans Parish Sheriff, who should be trying to get out from under the handcuffs of the consent decree, [is] using that as a shield to avoid the possible implications of refusing to cooperate with ICE,\u201d Morris told committee members.\nWill Harrell, senior program monitor for the Sheriff\u2019s Office said while he\u2019s disappointed that the bill passed, he is \u201cnot surprised with the outcome, given the anti-immigrant climate.\u201d He said he\u2019s concerned about how Orleans Parish Sheriff, Susan Hutson, will follow both the state law and the federal court order\n\u201cThe sheriff does not intend to be a breaker of laws,\u201d Harrell said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a question of which law we need to follow.\u201d\nSenate Bill 100\nSenate Bill 100 mirrors a 2024 executive order from Landry, signed in the early days of his governorship, that requires state departments and their sub-agencies to calculate and report on the amount of money that undocumented immigrants are costing the state. According to Rep. Michael Johnson, R-Pineville \u2014 who brought the bill to the House floor \u2014 Landry and Murrill requested SB15 be crafted to codify the language in that executive order.\nUndocumented immigrants are already shut out of some state-administered services. They are ineligible for food stamp benefits or Medicaid, for example, and they can\u2019t get drivers\u2019 licenses. But they attend schools, get medical treatment at public hospitals and use emergency shelters, among other things.\nAdvocates against the bill said recording identifying information like citizenship or immigration status, will not only affect undocumented immigrants, but also people who may not trust their government for other reasons, making it less likely that they seek out essential services like medical care.\n\u201cNot all of these services require any kind of identification right now, [like] the low barrier homeless shelters or food banks or things like that, and there are people who are going to be unwilling to get benefits if it requires of citizenship verification,\u201d Sissy Phleger, a safety net analyst for state think tank Invest in Louisiana, said in a phone interview last week. \u201cIt is going to burden people in Louisiana who don\u2019t have enough to eat. I don\u2019t have a place to live and that seems cruel and unnecessary.\u201d\nDuring discussions over the bill on the House floor, Democratic Caucus chairperson Rep. Matthew Willard, D-New Orleans, expressed concern over the proposed penalties in the bill: the withholding of funding to agencies that do not comply.\n\u201cFor me it seems kind of like a threat,\u201d Willard said.\nJohnson called the penalty an \u201cincentive\u201d to follow the law.\n\u201cThis is just transparency,\u201d Johnson said.\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\nThis article first appeared on Verite News New Orleans and is republished here under a Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

But one of the other lawmakers was not home and the suspect left the other house after police arrived, acting U.S. Attorney Joseph Thompson said at a press conference Monday. WATCH: Minnesota Sen. Klobuchar reflects on legacy of slain state lawmaker The suspect, Vance Boelter, surrendered to police Sunday after they found him in the woods near his home following a massive manhunt that began early Saturday near Minneapolis. He is accused of posing as a police officer and fatally shooting former Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, in their home early Saturday in the northern Minneapolis suburbs. Authorities say he also shot Sen. John Hoffman, a Democrat, and his wife, Yvette. They were injured at their residence about 9 miles (about 15 kilometers) away. The 57-year-old Boelter was charged with federal murder, stalking offenses. He already faces state charges, including murder and attempted murder. \u201cBoelter planned his attack carefully\u201d by researching his intended victims and their families and conducting surveillance of their homes and taking notes, Thompson said. Though the targets were Democrats and elected officials, Thompson said it was too soon to speculate on any sort of political ideology that could explain his motives. Thompson said it was too early to say if the Justice Department would seek the death penalty but noted that that was among the options available to the government based on the charges. The counts charged in the criminal complaint could be amended by prosecutors as they pursue a grand jury indictment as a prerequisite for bringing the case to trial. Authorities declined to name the two other elected officials whom Boelter allegedly stalked but who escaped harm. But it was clear the shootings were politically motivated, they said. \u201cThis was a targeted attack against individuals who answered the call to public service,\u201d said Alvin Winston, the special agent in charge of the FBI\u2019s Minneapolis field office. The resulting search, he said, was the largest manhunt in the history of the state. He is accused of posing as a police officer and fatally shooting former Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, in their home early Saturday in the northern Minneapolis suburbs. Authorities say he also shot Sen. John Hoffman, a Democrat, and his wife, Yvette. They were injured at their residence about 9 miles (about 15 kilometers) away. \u201cOne man\u2019s unthinkable actions have altered the state of Minnesota,\u201d Democratic Gov. Tim Walz said at a news conference after Boelter\u2019s arrest. The search for Boelter was the \u201clargest manhunt in the state\u2019s history,\u201d Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley said. It began when Brooklyn Park officers went to check on Hortman\u2019s home and saw her husband gunned down before the shooter fled. A photo posted by the Ramsey County Sheriff\u2019s Office appears to show Vance Luther Boelter, 57, the suspected gunman in the shooting deaths of a Minnesota Democratic state lawmaker and her husband, in custody, at an unidentified location, released June 15, 2025. Photo by Ramsey County Sheriff\u2019s Office via Facebook/Handout via Reuters Authorities on Sunday located a vehicle Boelter was using abandoned in rural Sibley County, where he lived, and a police officer reported that he believed he saw Boelter running into the woods, Bruley said. Police set up a large perimeter and called in 20 different tactical teams, divvying up the area and searching for him. During the search, police said they received information confirming someone was in the woods and searched for hours, using a helicopter and officers on foot, until they found Boelter. He surrendered to police, crawling out to officers in the woods before he was handcuffed and taken into custody in a field, authorities said. Jail records show Boelter was booked into the Hennepin County Jail at 1:02 a.m. Central Time Monday and include two mug shots, one from the front and one from the side, of Boelter wearing an orange prison shirt. A targeted attack Drew Evans, superintendent of the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, said the violence likely would\u2019ve continued had Brooklyn Park officers not checked on Hortman\u2019s home, causing Boelter to flee. The Hoffmans were attacked first at their home in Champin early Saturday. A criminal complaint unsealed after Boelter\u2019s arrest indicated their adult daughter called 911 just after 2 a.m. to say a masked person had come to the door and shot her parents. After police in nearby Brooklyn Park learned that a lawmaker had been shot, they sent patrol officers to check on the Hortmans\u2019 home. Brooklyn Park police officers arrived just in time to see Boelter shoot Mark Hortman through the open door of the home, the complaint says. It says they exchanged gunfire with Boelter, who fled inside the home before escaping the scene. Melissa Hortman was found dead inside, the complaint said. Authorities said Boelter posed as a police officer, even allegedly altering a vehicle to make it look like a police car. No details on motive Authorities did not give a motive as they announced Boelter\u2019s arrest. A list of about 70 names was found in writings recovered from the fake police vehicle that was left at the crime scene, said two law enforcement officials who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss details of the ongoing investigation. The writings and list of names included prominent state and federal lawmakers and community leaders, along with abortion rights advocates and information about health care facilities, according to the officials.

An escalation in political violence The shootings come as political leaders nationwide have been attacked, harassed and intimidated amid deep political divisions. Lawmakers said they were disturbed by the attacks as Twin Cities residents mourned. \u201cThis cannot be the norm. It cannot be the way that we deal with our political differences,\u201d Walz said Sunday. On Sunday evening, U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar shared a statement from Yvette Hoffman expressing appreciation for the outpouring of public support.

(AP) \u2014 Hundreds of law officers fanned out across a Minneapolis suburb Saturday in pursuit of a man who authorities say posed as a police officer and fatally shot a Democratic state lawmaker in her home in what Gov. Tim Walz called \u201ca politically motivated assassination.\u201d Authorities said the suspect also shot and wounded a second lawmaker and was believed to be trying to flee the area. Democratic former House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, were killed in their Brooklyn Park home. Sen. John Hoffman, also a Democrat, and his wife, Yvette, were injured at their Champlin address, about 9 miles (about 15 kilometers) away. WATCH: Minnesota Gov. Walz holds briefing on shootings of two state lawmakers and their spouses Authorities identified the suspect as 57-year-old Vance Boelter, and the FBI issued a reward of up to $50,000 for information leading to his arrest and conviction. Authorities displayed a photo taken Saturday of Boelter wearing a tan cowboy hat and asked the public to report sightings. Drew Evans, superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, said investigators obtained video as well. He did not give details on a possible motive. Boelter is a former political appointee who served on the same state workforce development board as Hoffman, records show, though it was not clear if or how well they knew each other. The early morning attacks prompted warnings to other elected officials around the state and the cancellation of planned \u201cNo Kings\u201d demonstrations against President Donald Trump, though some went ahead anyway. Authorities said the suspect had \u201cNo Kings\u201d flyers in his car and writings mentioning the names of the victims as well as other lawmakers and officials, though they could not say if he had any other specific targets. A Minnesota official told The Associated Press that the suspect\u2019s writings also contained information targeting prominent lawmakers who have been outspoken in favor of abortion rights. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was ongoing. The shootings happened at a time when political leaders nationwide have been attacked, harassed and intimidated amid deep political divisions. \u201cWe must all, in Minnesota and across the country, stand against all forms of political violence,\u201d Walz, a Democrat, said at a news conference. \u201cThose responsible for this will be held accountable.\u201d The governor also ordered flags to fly at half-staff in Hortman\u2019s honor. Law enforcement agents recovered several AK-style firearms from the suspect\u2019s vehicle, and he was believed to still be armed with a pistol, a person familiar with the matter told AP. The person could not publicly discuss details of the investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity. An overnight shooting Police responded to reports of gunfire at the Hoffmans\u2019 home shortly after 2 a.m., Champlin police said, and found the couple with multiple gunshot wounds. After seeing who the victims were, police sent officers to proactively check on Hortman\u2019s home. There they encountered what appeared to be a police vehicle and a man dressed as an officer at the door, leaving the house. \u201cWhen officers confronted him, the individual immediately fired upon the officers who exchanged gunfire, and the suspect retreated back into the home\u201d and escaped on foot, Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley said. Multiple bullet holes could be seen in the front door of Hoffman\u2019s home. John and Yvette Hoffman each underwent surgery, according to Walz. \u201cWe are cautiously optimistic they will survive this assassination attempt,\u201d the governor said at a morning news conference. Trump said in a statement that the FBI would join in the investigation. \u201cOur Attorney General, Pam Bondi, and the FBI, are investigating the situation, and they will be prosecuting anyone involved to the fullest extent of the law. Such horrific violence will not be tolerated in the United States of America. God Bless the great people of Minnesota, a truly great place!\u201d Two Democratic lawmakers targeted Hortman, 55, had been the top Democratic leader in the state House since 2017. She led Democrats in a three-week walkout at the beginning of this year\u2019s session in a power struggle with Republicans. Under a power sharing agreement, she turned the gavel over to Republican Rep. Lisa Demuth and assumed the title speaker emerita. Hortman used her position as speaker in 2023 to help champion expanded protections for abortion rights, including legislation to solidify Minnesota\u2019s status as a refuge for patients from restrictive states who travel to the state to seek abortions \u2014 and to protect providers who serve them.

Hoffman, 60, was first elected in 2012 and was chair of the Senate Human Services Committee, which oversees one of the biggest parts of the state budget. He and his wife have one daughter. State Patrol Col. Christina Bogojevic asked people \u201cout of an abundance of caution\u201d not to attend \u201cNo Kings\u201d protests. Bogojevic said authorities did not have any direct evidence that the protests would be targeted, but noted the \u201cNo Kings\u201d flyers in the car. Organizers announced that all demonstrations in the state were canceled, but many people still showed up for protests at the Capitol and elsewhere in the Twin Cities area. The suspect Boelter was appointed to the workforce development board in 2016 and then reappointed in 2019 to a four-year term that expired in 2023, state records show. Corporate records show Boelter\u2019s wife filed to create a company called Praetorian Guard Security Services LLC with the same Green Isle mailing address listed for the couple. On a website for the business, Boelter\u2019s wife is listed as president and CEO, while he is listed as director of security patrols.

An online resume says Boelter is a security contractor who has worked in the Middle East and Africa, in addition to past managerial roles at companies in Minnesota. Boelter texted friends at a Minneapolis residence, where he had rented a room and would stay one or two nights a week, to say he had \u201cmade some choices,\u201d the Minnesota Star Tribune reported. In the messages, read to reporters by David Carlson, Boelter did not specify what he had done but said: \u201cI\u2019m going to be gone for a while.

He added that the suspect\u2019s wife once came over to pray with his wife and daughter. Massive search Hundreds of police and sheriff deputies, some in tactical gear with assault-style weapons, were scattered throughout the town. Some checkpoints were set up. Police lifted a shelter-in-place order in the afternoon, saying they had reason to believe the suspect was no longer in the area. \u201cThis is crazy, someone going after representatives,\u201d said Brooklyn Park resident Douglas Thompson, 62. \u201cThis is wrong.

But one of the other lawmakers was not home and the suspect left the other house after police arrived, acting U.S. Attorney Joseph Thompson said at a press conference Monday. WATCH: Minnesota Sen. Klobuchar reflects on legacy of slain state lawmaker The suspect, Vance Boelter, surrendered to police Sunday after they found him in the woods near his home following a massive manhunt that began early Saturday near Minneapolis. He is accused of posing as a police officer and fatally shooting former Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, in their home early Saturday in the northern Minneapolis suburbs. Authorities say he also shot Sen. John Hoffman, a Democrat, and his wife, Yvette. They were injured at their residence about 9 miles (about 15 kilometers) away. The 57-year-old Boelter was charged with federal murder, stalking offenses. He already faces state charges, including murder and attempted murder. \u201cBoelter planned his attack carefully\u201d by researching his intended victims and their families and conducting surveillance of their homes and taking notes, Thompson said. Though the targets were Democrats and elected officials, Thompson said it was too soon to speculate on any sort of political ideology that could explain his motives. Thompson said it was too early to say if the Justice Department would seek the death penalty but noted that that was among the options available to the government based on the charges. The counts charged in the criminal complaint could be amended by prosecutors as they pursue a grand jury indictment as a prerequisite for bringing the case to trial. Authorities declined to name the two other elected officials whom Boelter allegedly stalked but who escaped harm. But it was clear the shootings were politically motivated, they said. \u201cThis was a targeted attack against individuals who answered the call to public service,\u201d said Alvin Winston, the special agent in charge of the FBI\u2019s Minneapolis field office. The resulting search, he said, was the largest manhunt in the history of the state. He is accused of posing as a police officer and fatally shooting former Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, in their home early Saturday in the northern Minneapolis suburbs. Authorities say he also shot Sen. John Hoffman, a Democrat, and his wife, Yvette. They were injured at their residence about 9 miles (about 15 kilometers) away. \u201cOne man\u2019s unthinkable actions have altered the state of Minnesota,\u201d Democratic Gov. Tim Walz said at a news conference after Boelter\u2019s arrest. The search for Boelter was the \u201clargest manhunt in the state\u2019s history,\u201d Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley said. It began when Brooklyn Park officers went to check on Hortman\u2019s home and saw her husband gunned down before the shooter fled. A photo posted by the Ramsey County Sheriff\u2019s Office appears to show Vance Luther Boelter, 57, the suspected gunman in the shooting deaths of a Minnesota Democratic state lawmaker and her husband, in custody, at an unidentified location, released June 15, 2025. Photo by Ramsey County Sheriff\u2019s Office via Facebook/Handout via Reuters Authorities on Sunday located a vehicle Boelter was using abandoned in rural Sibley County, where he lived, and a police officer reported that he believed he saw Boelter running into the woods, Bruley said. Police set up a large perimeter and called in 20 different tactical teams, divvying up the area and searching for him. During the search, police said they received information confirming someone was in the woods and searched for hours, using a helicopter and officers on foot, until they found Boelter. He surrendered to police, crawling out to officers in the woods before he was handcuffed and taken into custody in a field, authorities said. Jail records show Boelter was booked into the Hennepin County Jail at 1:02 a.m. Central Time Monday and include two mug shots, one from the front and one from the side, of Boelter wearing an orange prison shirt. A targeted attack Drew Evans, superintendent of the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, said the violence likely would\u2019ve continued had Brooklyn Park officers not checked on Hortman\u2019s home, causing Boelter to flee. The Hoffmans were attacked first at their home in Champin early Saturday. A criminal complaint unsealed after Boelter\u2019s arrest indicated their adult daughter called 911 just after 2 a.m. to say a masked person had come to the door and shot her parents. After police in nearby Brooklyn Park learned that a lawmaker had been shot, they sent patrol officers to check on the Hortmans\u2019 home. Brooklyn Park police officers arrived just in time to see Boelter shoot Mark Hortman through the open door of the home, the complaint says. It says they exchanged gunfire with Boelter, who fled inside the home before escaping the scene. Melissa Hortman was found dead inside, the complaint said. Authorities said Boelter posed as a police officer, even allegedly altering a vehicle to make it look like a police car. No details on motive Authorities did not give a motive as they announced Boelter\u2019s arrest. A list of about 70 names was found in writings recovered from the fake police vehicle that was left at the crime scene, said two law enforcement officials who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss details of the ongoing investigation. The writings and list of names included prominent state and federal lawmakers and community leaders, along with abortion rights advocates and information about health care facilities, according to the officials. A Minnesota official told AP lawmakers who had been outspoken in favor of abortion rights were on the list. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was ongoing.

But one of the other lawmakers was not home and the suspect left the other house after police arrived, acting U.S. Attorney Joseph Thompson said at a press conference Monday. WATCH: Minnesota Sen. Klobuchar reflects on legacy of slain state lawmaker The suspect, Vance Boelter, surrendered to police Sunday after they found him in the woods near his home following a massive manhunt that began early Saturday near Minneapolis. He is accused of posing as a police officer and fatally shooting former Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, in their home early Saturday in the northern Minneapolis suburbs. Authorities say he also shot Sen. John Hoffman, a Democrat, and his wife, Yvette. They were injured at their residence about 9 miles (about 15 kilometers) away. The 57-year-old Boelter was charged with federal murder, stalking offenses. He already faces state charges, including murder and attempted murder. \u201cBoelter planned his attack carefully\u201d by researching his intended victims and their families and conducting surveillance of their homes and taking notes, Thompson said. Though the targets were Democrats and elected officials, Thompson said it was too soon to speculate on any sort of political ideology that could explain his motives. Thompson said it was too early to say if the Justice Department would seek the death penalty but noted that that was among the options available to the government based on the charges. The counts charged in the criminal complaint could be amended by prosecutors as they pursue a grand jury indictment as a prerequisite for bringing the case to trial. Authorities declined to name the two other elected officials whom Boelter allegedly stalked but who escaped harm. But it was clear the shootings were politically motivated, they said. \u201cThis was a targeted attack against individuals who answered the call to public service,\u201d said Alvin Winston, the special agent in charge of the FBI\u2019s Minneapolis field office. The resulting search, he said, was the largest manhunt in the history of the state. He is accused of posing as a police officer and fatally shooting former Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, in their home early Saturday in the northern Minneapolis suburbs. Authorities say he also shot Sen. John Hoffman, a Democrat, and his wife, Yvette. They were injured at their residence about 9 miles (about 15 kilometers) away. \u201cOne man\u2019s unthinkable actions have altered the state of Minnesota,\u201d Democratic Gov. Tim Walz said at a news conference after Boelter\u2019s arrest. The search for Boelter was the \u201clargest manhunt in the state\u2019s history,\u201d Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley said. It began when Brooklyn Park officers went to check on Hortman\u2019s home and saw her husband gunned down before the shooter fled. A photo posted by the Ramsey County Sheriff\u2019s Office appears to show Vance Luther Boelter, 57, the suspected gunman in the shooting deaths of a Minnesota Democratic state lawmaker and her husband, in custody, at an unidentified location, released June 15, 2025. Photo by Ramsey County Sheriff\u2019s Office via Facebook/Handout via Reuters Authorities on Sunday located a vehicle Boelter was using abandoned in rural Sibley County, where he lived, and a police officer reported that he believed he saw Boelter running into the woods, Bruley said. Police set up a large perimeter and called in 20 different tactical teams, divvying up the area and searching for him. During the search, police said they received information confirming someone was in the woods and searched for hours, using a helicopter and officers on foot, until they found Boelter. He surrendered to police, crawling out to officers in the woods before he was handcuffed and taken into custody in a field, authorities said. Jail records show Boelter was booked into the Hennepin County Jail at 1:02 a.m. Central Time Monday and include two mug shots, one from the front and one from the side, of Boelter wearing an orange prison shirt. A targeted attack Drew Evans, superintendent of the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, said the violence likely would\u2019ve continued had Brooklyn Park officers not checked on Hortman\u2019s home, causing Boelter to flee. The Hoffmans were attacked first at their home in Champin early Saturday. A criminal complaint unsealed after Boelter\u2019s arrest indicated their adult daughter called 911 just after 2 a.m. to say a masked person had come to the door and shot her parents. After police in nearby Brooklyn Park learned that a lawmaker had been shot, they sent patrol officers to check on the Hortmans\u2019 home. Brooklyn Park police officers arrived just in time to see Boelter shoot Mark Hortman through the open door of the home, the complaint says. It says they exchanged gunfire with Boelter, who fled inside the home before escaping the scene. Melissa Hortman was found dead inside, the complaint said. Authorities said Boelter posed as a police officer, even allegedly altering a vehicle to make it look like a police car. No details on motive Authorities did not give a motive as they announced Boelter\u2019s arrest. A list of about 70 names was found in writings recovered from the fake police vehicle that was left at the crime scene, said two law enforcement officials who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss details of the ongoing investigation. The writings and list of names included prominent state and federal lawmakers and community leaders, along with abortion rights advocates and information about health care facilities, according to the officials. A Minnesota official told AP lawmakers who had been outspoken in favor of abortion rights were on the list. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was ongoing.

Around 6 a.m. Saturday, Boelter texted friends to apologize for his actions, though he didn\u2019t say what he had done. \u201cI\u2019m going to be gone for a while.

An escalation in political violence The shootings come as political leaders nationwide have been attacked, harassed and intimidated amid deep political divisions. Lawmakers said they were disturbed by the attacks as Twin Cities residents mourned. \u201cThis cannot be the norm.

(AP) \u2014 Kilmar Abrego Garcia pleaded not guilty to human smuggling charges during an arraignment in federal court in Tennessee on Friday. Abrego Garcia is a citizen of El Salvador who had been living legally in the United States before he was wrongfully deported in March. His case has become a rallying point for opposition to President Donald Trump\u2019s mass deportation agenda. Facing mounting pressure to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S., the Trump administration brought him back last week. However, he was immediately taken into custody on new criminal charges filed by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Middle District of Tennessee. In court filings, prosecutors accused him of being a dangerous member of the notorious MS-13 gang, but the charges against him are only for transporting people who were in the country illegally. Still, he could face a lengthy prison sentence. He is accused of transporting hundreds of people over many years, and the maximum sentence for transporting each person is 10 years. Before the hearing began in Nashville, Abrego Garcia\u2019s wife told a crowd outside a church that Thursday marked three months since the Trump administration \u201cabducted and disappeared my husband and separated him from our family.\u201d Her voice choked with emotion, Jennifer Vasquez Sura said she saw her husband for the first time on Thursday. She said, \u201cKilmar wants you to have faith,\u201d and asked the people supporting him and his family \u201c\u2019to continue fighting, and I will be victorious because God is with us.\u2019\u201d Abrego Garcia is a citizen of El Salvador who had been living in the United States for more than a decade before he was wrongfully deported by the Republican administration in March. The expulsion violated a 2019 U.S. immigration judge\u2019s order that shielded him from deportation to his native country because he likely faced gang persecution there. While the Trump administration described the mistaken removal as \u201can administrative error,\u201d officials have continued to justify it by insisting Abrego Garcia was a member of the MS-13 gang. His wife and attorneys have denied the allegations, saying he\u2019s simply a construction worker and family man. Trump\u2019s administration returned Abrego Garcia to the U.S. last week to face criminal charges related to what it said was a human smuggling operation that transported immigrants across the country. The charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee during which Abrego Garcia was driving a vehicle with eight passengers.

The charges against Abrego Garcia are human smuggling. But in their request to keep Abrego Garcia in jail, U.S. attorneys also accuse him of trafficking drugs and firearms and of abusing the women he transported, among other claims, although he is not charged with such crimes. The U.S. attorneys also accuse Abrego Garcia of taking part in a murder in El Salvador. However, none of those allegations is part of the charges against him, and at his initial appearance June 6, the judge warned prosecutors she cannot detain someone based solely on allegations.

In a Wednesday court filing, Abrego Garcia\u2019s public defenders argued the government is not even entitled to a detention hearing \u2014 much less detention \u2014 because the charges against him aren\u2019t serious enough. Although the maximum sentence for smuggling one person is 10 years, and Abrego Garcia is accused of transporting hundreds of people over nearly a decade, his defense attorneys point out there\u2019s no minimum sentence. The average sentence for human smuggling in 2024 was just 15 months, according to court filings. The decision to charge Abrego Garcia criminally prompted the resignation of Ben Schrader, who was chief of the criminal division at the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Middle District of Tennessee. He posted about his departure on social media on the day of the indictment, writing, \u201cIt has been an incredible privilege to serve as a prosecutor with the Department of Justice, where the only job description I\u2019ve ever known is to do the right thing, in the right way, for the right reasons.\u201d He did not directly address the indictment and declined to comment when reached by The Associated Press.

(Photo by Michael M.

Abrego Garcia had been moved to a different El Salvador prison prior to his release.\nAbrego Gacia had deportation protections to his home country of El Salvador since 2019.\nHe was pulled over by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in March and informed that his immigration status had changed. He was later placed on one of three deportation flights on March 15 to CECOT.\nThe Trump administration admitted his removal was an \u201cadministrative error\u201d but has since alleged that Abrego Garcia was a leader in the MS-13 gang without producing evidence in the federal civil court overseeing the suit challenging his removal.\nMaryland U.S. Sen.

Cooper Williams is now trotting to the mound to relieve Evans, who struck out five UCLA batters and allowed two earned runs across 4 \u2153 innings. The freshman did his job.\nBut Williams, a lefty, is inheriting two baserunners with one out. Expect LSU to ask him to record these next two outs against a string of left-handed batters, then possibly turn the ninth inning over to the flamethrower Chase Shores. He was warming up in the pen too.\nFinal line for Evans: 4 \u2153 innings, 4 hits, 2 ER, 0 BB, 5 K, 68 pitches.\nUPDATED, 11:43 a.m. \u2014 With two outs in the seventh, Daniel Dickinson caught a slider on the end of his bat, and it dropped into shallow right field, scoring Jared Jones from third.

The Tigers need him to string together some innings this morning.\nUPDATED, 10:07 a.m. \u2014 The weather delay put Jay Johnson in quite a pickle. Remember, should LSU lose to UCLA, it will have to turn around and play an elimination game against Arkansas at 6 p.m. tonight (weather permitting, of course). Kade Anderson and Anthony Eyanson are already burned.\nSo, what options does Johnson have?\nHe can either push all his chips into the rest of the matchup with the Bruins this morning. Or he can play it safe and decide to save one or two of his best arms in case the Tigers need them later this evening for a game against Arkansas.\nIt's a tricky situation. Johnson has to manage it well, or LSU's season could come to a sudden conclusion tonight.\nUPDATED, 9:50 a.m. \u2014 Pitching update.

Here's a refresher on where we left off last night before the weather delay.\n- In the first, the Bruins jumped on starter Anthony Eyanson early, scoring three runs on four hits.\n- Then LSU's hitters responded with four runs of their own. The highlight of that half inning was a three-run home run by Jared Jones, the star slugger who struck out a career-high five times in the Tigers' CWS opener against Arkansas.\n- LSU then added another run in the bottom of the third on a base hit by Luis Hernandez.\nThe game will resume in the top of the fourth with the Tigers leading 5-3.\nWe're not expecting to see Eyanson back on the mound today.

Tigers' lead is still 4-3.\nUPDATED, 6:53 p.m. \u2014 Anthony Eyanson just plunked a UCLA batter. He hasn't had his best stuff today, largely because he's had trouble locating his slider. That time, he left it on the shoulder of Bruin nine-hole hitter Phoenix Call.\nHowever, UCLA couldn't take advantage. The second was a much-needed scoreless frame for Eyanson, who struck out the last hitter with a nicely thrown breaking ball.\nLSU is up 4-3 in the bottom of the second.\nUPDATED, 6:38 p.m. \u2014 Three-run home run by Jared Jones. Now LSU has the lead.\nThat homer had to feel good for Jones, who struck out a career-high five times on Saturday vs. Arkansas. At practice on Sunday, coach Jay Johnson took a few minutes to talk to Jones about his swing. Then the junior stayed around for after his teammates had boarded the bus to squeeze in an extra round of batting practice.\nThat extra work has already paid off.\nLSU is up 4-3 at the start of the second.\nJared Jones getting in some extra cage work after practice \u2026 look out! pic.twitter.com/ju1alFiVb6\n\u2014 Scott Rabalais (@RabalaisAdv) June 15, 2025\nUPDATED, 6:36 p.m. \u2014 Thanks to a beautiful hit by Steven Milam and a timely single by Jake Brown, LSU has its first run of the game.

Two of those runs were driven in by grounders, including a short dribbler to pitcher Anthony Eyanson. Not a good start for the Tigers, who allowed only one run on just three hits Saturday against Arkansas.\nAfter the top half of the first, the Bruins have three runs on four hits. Eyanson, a starter with a 2.74 ERA, threw 23 pitches in his first frame.\nT1: A lot of these ground balls have been well-placed but Eyanson doesn't have a good feel for his slider now, and he's left some balls up.\n\u2014 Koki Riley (@KokiRiley) June 16, 2025\nThat last hit was a low fastball that AJ Salgado turned into an infield single. Another run scores to make it 2-0 Bruins. #LSU https://t.co/aFTgHx21bj\nUPDATED, 6:23 p.m. \u2014 Another run for UCLA. This time, another hard-hit grounder drove it in.

Eyanson has now allowed four hits and two runs.\nOnly one out. UCLA up 2-0 in the top of the first.\nUPDATED, 6:20 p.m. \u2014 UCLA cleanup hitter Roman Martin saw a slider inside, then drove it for a line-drive double into left field. One Bruin scored.

The LSU starter threw 17 pitches in the first.\nUPDATED, 6:20 p.m.: Three up, three down for LSU. Josh Pearson grounded out, Ethan Frey flew out, and Jared Jones struck out. Wind is blowing in at Charles Schwab Field, which means that it'll be tough to knock one over the fence.\nUPDATED, 5:30 p.m.: Before first pitch, be sure to read the twin columns our Scott Rabalais wrote on-site in advance of the CWS. One is about LSU's long-lasting love affair with Omaha, and the other is about Jay Johnson, the singularly focused coach who reveres that city in Nebraska\u2014 for its history, its tradition and its promise of glory.\nUPDATED, 4:49 p.m.: Lineups are out. Most notable change for LSU is that Josh Pearson is leading off, and Derek Curiel is batting sixth.\nRemember, Jay Johnson drew up a similar order for the Tigers' NCAA super-regional opener against West Virginia, and it paid off.

A win would secure another day off and place LSU a victory away from reaching the CWS final.\nThen the weather came.\nJust before the start of the fourth inning, lightning and rain lit up the night sky for two hours and 53 minutes. The matchup was suspended at 10:13 p.m.\nMardi Gras Mike travels to Omaha\nMonday's game was given a restart of 10:03 a.m. Tuesday. A loss to UCLA would force the Tigers to play again Tuesday versus Arkansas in an elimination game.\nLSU needed someone to reverse its misfortune. That's when LSU coach Jay Johnson turned to Casan Evans. The freshman right-hander toed the rubber to begin the restarted game and excelled, allowing just two runs in 4\u2153 innings to guide LSU past the Bruins 9-5.\n\"Coach Johnson had told me that once we got out of the delay that I would be on the mound, and then it got rolled over to today,\" Evans said. \"Just went back to the hotel and got ready for today. Woke up early.\"\nWith the win, LSU will face the winner of Tuesday night's elimination game between UCLA and Arkansas at 6 p.m. Wednesday.\nTuesday's win marks the eighth time LSU has started its College World Series run with a 2-0 record. In the seven previous instances, the Tigers won the national title six times.\n\"Great win for our team,\" Johnson said. \"Really proud of them \u2014 the mindset piece, the disruption of the game last night because of weather.\"\nEvans had five strikeouts and didn't allow an extra-base hit. He consistently fooled UCLA hitters with his split changeup and pounded the strike zone, issuing no walks and hitting one batter.\n\"I love the tempo that Casan set today,\" Johnson said. \"I thought he was outstanding, as he always is.\"\nHe eventually exited for freshman left-hander Cooper Williams after two hitters reached with one out in the eighth inning.\nWilliams struggled in his first appearance in Omaha. The Texas native walked two batters and allowed both inherited runners to score. The two runs cut LSU's lead to 8-5 before redshirt sophomore right-hander Chase Shores entered with two outs and the bases loaded.\nShores needed just one pitch to end the jam, forcing a fielder's choice groundout to sophomore Steven Milam at shortstop. He then breezed through the ninth inning to end the game.\n\"It felt amazing,\" Shores said when asked about the one-pitch out in the eighth. \"I mean, if I can do it in one pitch (and) you save my pitch count, that's even better.\"\nThe LSU bats produced during the restart, scoring four runs with two outs.\nRun-scoring singles from Milam and sophomore Jake Brown in the fourth inning stretched LSU's Monday lead to 7-3. Three innings later, junior Daniel Dickinson blooped a single into shallow right field that drove in a run before.\n\"Rough day for me, it's all good,\" Dickinson said regarding his bloop hit. \"We'll take them whenever you can.\"\nJunior Jared Jones drove in his fourth run of the game in the eighth with a single that gave LSU a 9-5 advantage.\nBefore the rain began to fall, LSU tallied four runs in the first inning and added another score in the third after falling behind 3-0.\nThe Tigers hit three consecutive singles in the first that resulted in a run-scoring hit by Brown. Two pitches later, Jones blasted a three-run home run to the opposite field that turned LSU's 3-1 deficit into a 4-3 lead.\nJones' homer was his 21st of the season and LSU's first in Omaha. The blast traveled 387 feet and was launched 110 mph into the teeth of the wind in right-center field.\nThe hit was his first of the College World Series after he went 0 for 5 with five strikeouts in LSU's win against Arkansas on Saturday.\n\"Offensively, we just wanted to start the game on the right note,\" Jones said. \"We talk about winning every inning. Obviously, they put up a three spot in the top half, so to win the inning we've got to put up at least four.\"\nThe Tigers added a fifth run in the third on senior Luis Hernandez's two-out single. The tally gave LSU a 5-3 lead before the game was stopped because of the weather.\nMilam, Jones and Brown led the Tigers with multiple hits apiece. Jones' home run was their only extra-base hit, but only one starter \u2014 redshirt junior Tanner Reaves \u2014 failed to record a hit.\n\"I think it kind of can go unnoticed with our team. It's more than talent. It's really skilled baseball players, and (Milam's) at the top of that,\" Johnson said. \"So when you have that kind of skill, you can make adjustments quickly and usually not stay down for long.\"\nEyanson's rocky start put LSU behind the eight ball Monday. The UC San Diego transfer surrendered three runs on three singles and a double in the first inning.\nHis fastball was up to 96 mph, but UCLA hitters were not fooled by his slider even if he did improve as the game continued. Eyanson retired six of the last seven batters he faced.\n\"I was getting ready to throw a warm-up on the mound (and) the umpire kind of screamed at me, saying, 'Hey, time to come off the field,' \" Eyanson said about Monday. \"I didn't really know it was going to rain (Monday) at all. I didn't really check the weather. But yeah, it kind of sucked.\""]}, {"topic": 6, "name": "Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u201cMusk Feud and Its Political and Economic Ramifications", "keywords": "musk, musks, elon, trump, doge, his, he, that, the, of", "documents": ["Trump and Musk\u2019s Dramatic Falling Out Displays the Hazards of Billionaire Rule.

Copy may not be in its final form.\nAMY GOODMAN: We begin today\u2019s show with the escalating feud between President Trump and Elon Musk, the world\u2019s richest man, who, up until just recently, was a top presidential adviser and Trump\u2019s top political benefactor. The fight could have broad implications for Trump\u2019s presidency, the Republican Party and many government programs, including NASA, that rely on technology from Musk\u2019s various companies. The feud became public Tuesday when Musk called Trump\u2019s so-called big, beautiful budget bill a \u201cdisgusting abomination\u201d because it will increase the federal deficit by $2.5 trillion. The tension then escalated considerably on Thursday.\nDuring a meeting with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, a reporter asked Trump about Musk\u2019s comment. This is part of his response.\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But I\u2019m very disappointed, because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here, better than you people. He knew everything about it. He had no problem with it. All of a sudden he had a problem. And he only developed the problem when he found out that we\u2019re going to have to cut the EV mandate, because that\u2019s billions and billions of dollars. And it really is unfair. \u2026 He knew it better than almost anybody, and he never had a problem until right after he left. And if you saw the statements he made about me, which I\u2019m sure you can get very easily \u2014 it\u2019s very fresh, on tape \u2014 he said the most beautiful things about me. And he hasn\u2019t said bad about me personally, but I\u2019m sure that\u2019ll be next. But I\u2019m very disappointed in Elon. I\u2019ve helped Elon a lot.\nAMY GOODMAN: The feud then spilled into social media, with the two billionaires launching personal attacks on their own social media platforms, Musk on X and Trump on Truth Social.\nAt 2:37 p.m. Thursday, Trump wrote, \u201cElon was \u2018wearing thin,\u2019 I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!\u201d unquote.\nAt 3:10 p.m., Musk wrote, quote, \u201cTime to drop the really big bomb, @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!\u201d\nThen Trump wrote, \u201cThe easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon\u2019s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn\u2019t do it!\u201d Trump said.\nMusk responded by threatening to decommission the Dragon spacecraft used by NASA. Musk also appeared to back the impeachment of Trump and took credit for Trump winning the presidency.\nTrump ally Steve Bannon went further, calling for Musk to be investigated and deported. He also called Trump to seize Musk\u2019s company SpaceX.\nTo talk more about the fracturing of the Trump-Musk relationship and what this could mean for the Republican Party, we\u2019re joined by Quinn Slobodian, professor of international history at Boston University, working on a book about Elon Musk titled Muskism. He is author of Hayek\u2019s Bastards: Race, Gold, IQ, and the Capitalism of the Far Right, as well as Crack-Up Capitalism: Market Radicals and the Dream of a World Without Democracy.\nProfessor Slobodian, welcome back to Democracy Now! Were you shocked by what you saw happen yesterday? I mean, who knows? They could be holding a joint news conference soon and announce they\u2019re back in love.\nQUINN SLOBODIAN: Yeah. I mean, they are people who always have their eye on the bottom line, but they also are, obviously, titanically sized egos. And I think that, more than anything, this is just a sign of how dangerous it is to put billions of dollars, even the lives of astronauts, the whole future of the American economy and the political scene, in the hands of two sole human beings.\nAMY GOODMAN: When you said threaten the lives of astronauts, explain.\nQUINN SLOBODIAN: Well, the Dragon unit that you mentioned is the only way for the astronauts in the International Space Station to get to and from where they are now. So, were he to decommission it, it might literally mean that they would be stranded out there, kind of Gravity style.\nSo, this is just one of the examples of many of the offloading of core government functions onto private service providers, that Elon Musk has been so masterful at playing, that we feel more and more exposed to, from the use of Starlink satellites in the field of battle in the Ukraine to the use of the same internet connection as leverage in his battle with the Brazilian government. I feel like, over time, we\u2019ll only realize more and more how much we are at the mercy of someone who is acting with total impetuousness, and sometimes not even with his own self-interest in mind.\nAMY GOODMAN: Let\u2019s go from the threat to lives in space to here on the ground, Elon Musk taking on the budget, calling it an \u201cabomination.\u201d When Trump said he knows that \u2014 the budget bill better than almost anyone else, inside and out, Musk\u2019s response was, \u201cThat is false. I never saw it. It was passed in the middle of the night.\u201d Can you talk about the significance? I mean, this is the guy in charge of DOGE. How many thousands of jobs have been lost? And yet, at the same time now he\u2019s viciously attacking the budget that was so narrowly passed, and it could threaten its ultimate passage.\nQUINN SLOBODIAN: I mean, I think it\u2019s worth sort of returning to the question of why Musk got involved at all with Trump \u2014 right? \u2014 what he was doing with this DOGE project. And I think it\u2019s possible to kind of split it up into three categories.\nI think, first of all, he was doing a kind of a bear hug strategy. So, I think, especially on the trade war and his many, many interests in China, you know, he has a Gigafactory there that has capacity to make a million Teslas a year. He wanted to get out in front of any possible excess of economic nationalism that might be rolled out.\nAnd then I think he was kind of making a Hail Mary move, that, you know, he hadn\u2019t really clicked with the Biden administration, and this could be a chance to maybe use a window of opportunity to boost his own aspirations, especially in artificial intelligence, where he was being outpaced by people like Sam Altman and OpenAI.\nAnd then, third, I think you could see it as a kind of moonshot strategy, where I think he was trying to really even more plug in his own services, especially SpaceX, to, in fact, not only get to the moon, but divert the whole project towards Mars. So, there was a lot of reasons why Musk would want to be involved.\nBut from Trump\u2019s point of view, he\u2019s never really been a fiscal hawk, right? He\u2019s always actually run against austerity in certain ways and run against this mainstream obsession with the debt ceiling and the deficit that has so defined GOP politics for the last couple decades. So it was always kind of an odd fit, and it\u2019s not surprising in that sense that Musk now feels that this budget is, you know, not hard austerity enough for his liking. It\u2019s telling, for example, that he\u2019s posted multiple Milton Friedman memes over the last couple of days, sort of implying that this problem of runaway debt inflation should be top of mind at all times for the government. But Trump has always profited by playing fast and loose with that kind of ideology.\nAnd the question is: Why now has this led to a snapping point \u2014\nAMY GOODMAN: So \u2014\nQUINN SLOBODIAN: \u2014 for Musk? And I think there\u2019s a \u2014\nAMY GOODMAN: Keep going.\nQUINN SLOBODIAN: If I could just say, I think there\u2019s a couple of things there. I think Trump invokes the EV mandate, and that is a serious issue, right? What that is \u2014 it needs to be broken down \u2014 is the capacity of California to enforce a move towards electric cars over time, a part of which is a regulatory credit system that allows normal ICE \u2014 internal combustion engine \u2014 vehicles to buy credits from electric vehicle manufacturers. And this is now 40% of Tesla\u2019s net income in the last year. It went up a billion dollars in the last year alone. And if that gets killed, it really does kind of kill Tesla\u2019s margin. And I think that Musk is starting to feel the heat from Chinese producers like BYD, battery producers like CATL. And I think he sees here maybe the possible demise of the Tesla brand, as he is hated more and more from both sides of the spectrum. So, there\u2019s reasons, as he returns to his businesses, to start to sweat about what he\u2019s actually signed up for.\nAMY GOODMAN: How about what this highlights around a rift within the MAGA movement, and where JD Vance fits into this, the vice president?\nQUINN SLOBODIAN: Well, it\u2019s always interesting to ask what exactly was going on with DOGE, right? I mean, if you want to get into the real kind of Dangerous Liaisons kind of courtesanship, I think, that is happening inside of the White House, it seems that, based on reporting, Stephen Miller was kind of stage managing, along with his wife, a lot of what was happening with DOGE.\nAnd if you look at what actually came out of DOGE \u2014 and this is a good time now for us to sort of do a autopsy or postmortem on it, as it winds down, really \u2014 he said he was going to do 2 trillion cut \u2014 $2 trillion in cuts, out of a $6 trillion budget \u2014 very unlikely \u2014 went back to $1 trillion, scaled it back to $150 billion. What did they end up taking out? I mean, it\u2019s basically culture war stuff, right? I mean, it\u2019s ways to trigger the progressives and the libs \u2014 get rid of USAID, attack NEH funding, arts funding, science funding, education, energy. These ended up being big wins not really for Musk\u2019s own bottom-line, cost-cutting mentality, but very much for the culture war being waged by people like Miller and JD Vance and Russell Vought at the Office of Management and Budget. So there is a way of looking at this as having been a success from their point of view. They were able to use the credibility of Musk as a kind of supposed, you know, brilliant, Edison-like inventor and wonderful, efficiency-creating cost cutter to actually get to some of their political goals.\nBut they never could bring that big number down. Why? Because entitlement spending still dominates the state spending in the GDP. And when you come close to that, you come close to the kind of beating heart of the social contract. And we saw the town hall meetings. We saw the anger when things started to encroach on the questions of Social Security and Medicaid. And for me, that was a very telling moment, and it was one that I think took Musk by surprise, too. He\u2019s not used to the idea of needing to engage with a kind of consent and legitimacy mechanism where people feel like they paid into something and should now get something back. He\u2019s used to interacting with a Twitter fan base, a set of really bought-in Tesla investors, for whom, you know, he always walks on water and he\u2019s a god reincarnate. And when he just was confronted with the anger of average people who want to make sure that they can pay for their next meal, he didn\u2019t know what to do.\nSo, I think that there\u2019s a kind of a \u2014 there\u2019s a way to see this as a victory for the national conservatives. They got to do some of their their easy wins against the progressives and the libs, and now they\u2019re able to keep the door open for more protectionism and expansion of spending, as we see in the so-called big, beautiful bill.\nAMY GOODMAN: Finally, do you think Musk has access to all of the private information that his DOGE army downloaded from all the agencies? Is that possible?\nQUINN SLOBODIAN: I am not a software programmer, and I do not know how databases work that well, but it seems at least likely that part of what they were doing there, when they were converting things done in old programming languages and updating them, was also harvesting a lot of that data for use for we don\u2019t know what. Feeding the machine of Grok or xAI is the most likely answer.\nAMY GOODMAN: And finally, let me ask you: Steve Bannon, who\u2019s on the anti-Musk side of the MAGA rift, has been calling for Trump to nationalize Musk\u2019s businesses and for him to be deported, right? I mean, Elon Musk comes from South Africa.\nQUINN SLOBODIAN: Yeah. I mean, this actually isn\u2019t the harshest thing that Bannon has ever said. He referred to Silicon Valley as an \u201capartheid state\u201d a few months ago. The idea of nationalizing SpaceX is an interesting one. It would certainly run against the core privatization ethos that Trump and the former GOP has been following for decades and decades. So far, I would chalk that up to just saber-rattling rhetoric for his podcast, more than an actual policy proposal.\nAMY GOODMAN: Quinn Slobodian, I want to thank you for being with us, professor of international history at Boston University.

The acrimony went public when Musk publicly slammed Trump\u2019s sweeping domestic policy package on Tuesday.\nMusk responded to the broadside by announcing his company, SpaceX, will withdraw from service its Dragon spacecraft \u2014 which is critical to the American space program.\n\u201cIn light of President Trump\u2019s statement about cancellation of my government contracts, @SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately,\u201d Musk wrote on X, the social media site he owns.\nMusk\u2019s threat would deprive the U.S. of its only assured way of supplying the International Space Station and bringing on and off astronauts. If executed, NASA would instead have to rely on Russia to bring supplies and astronauts to the station. NASA had contracted with Boeing on the Starliner, a competitor to the Dragon spacecraft, but that system is temporarily out of service following problems with the craft.\nBut he seemingly walked away from that threat late Thursday. Responding to an X user pleading for the two men to \u201ccool off and take a step back for a couple days,\u201d Musk said \u201cok, we won\u2019t decommission Dragon.\u201d\nHe\u2019s continued to lash out at the White House in the days since \u2014 with Musk baiting Trump by name earlier Thursday, and Trump responding by chastising the Tesla CEO from the Oval Office later in the day.\nStill, Trump\u2019s criticism from the White House \u2014 where the two men less than a week ago shared a laudatory sendoff for Musk \u2014 was not as pointed as the president\u2019s barbs on social media.\n\u201cWithout me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,\u201d Musk wrote on X Thursday. \u201cSuch ingratitude.\u201d\nMusk\u2019s companies have significant ties to the federal government, even before the Trump administration. SpaceX is one of NASA\u2019s largest contractors. And his car company Tesla benefitted from a clean energy subsidy that is on the chopping block in Republicans\u2019 reconciliation package.\n\u201cElon was \u2018wearing thin,\u2019 I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!\u201d Trump posted.\n\u201cSuch an obvious lie. So sad,\u201d Musk fired back.\nTrump has previously boosted Tesla because of his close relationship with Musk. In March, with the company\u2019s stock at a low after public anger over job cuts fueled by Musk\u2019s DOGE initiative, the president toured different Tesla models at a makeshift car show on the White House lawn. Trump later purchased his own Tesla, \u201ca show of confidence and support\u201d for Musk.\nTesla\u2019s stock tanked on Thursday, falling more than 14 percent as the two traded barbs.\nTrump has routinely wielded the power of the executive branch against institutions that he deems are misbehaving. He\u2019s frozen billions in federal grants to some of the country\u2019s top universities, Harvard chief among them, as punishment for alleged antisemitism and civil rights violations. And he\u2019s secured multimillion dollar deals with law firms weary of his threats to tank their business.\nSam Skove contributed to this report.", "Elon Musk goes on a warpath against Trump and the GOP. Elon Musk goes on a warpath against Trump and the GOP\nThe fallout from the very public breakup could engulf Republican hopes of holding onto the House.\nElon Musk just launched a war against the GOP. Now the party\u2019s hopes of holding onto power are at stake.\nMusk has gone from helping Republicans take total control of Washington \u2014 spending nearly $300 million to become the single biggest known donor last year \u2014 to attacking the highest-ranking leaders of the party and daring the rank and file to cross him.\n\u201cTrump has 3.5 years left as President, but I will be around for 40+ years,\u201d Musk said on X.\nThe post was an unambiguous warning from the world\u2019s richest man, who has the power to single-handedly reshape elections with his wealth. It was not long ago that Republicans hoped Musk could pour cash into their efforts to help maintain control of Washington. Instead, he\u2019s becoming their public adversary.\nMusk spent Thursday online attacking President Donald Trump over Republicans\u2019 massive tax-and-spending bill, which Musk says does not cut enough government spending.\nHe\u2019d already threatened to challenge Republicans who support the megabill; on Thursday, he blasted House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, took credit for Republicans winning trifecta control in November, and floated the idea of launching a third party.\n\u201cThis is a massive crack in the MAGA coalition,\u201d said Matthew Bartlett, a Republican strategist and a former Trump administration appointee. \u201cThis town is historically built on Republican versus Democrat, and this seems to be crazy versus crazy. It is asymmetric and it seems, for the first time, President Trump seems to be out-crazied.\u201d\nJust a few weeks ago, Republicans were still praising Musk for his financial backing in the 2024 election as they hoped he\u2019d make a graceful return to the private sector after overseeing the administration\u2019s program to slash federal spending. Less than one week ago, Musk was in the Oval Office with Trump commemorating his time in administration as a special government employee.\nBut that polite departure, it quickly became evident, was not going to happen.\n\u201cElon was \u2018wearing thin,\u2019 I asked him to leave,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social, blaming Musk\u2019s anger on the megabill\u2019s removal of electric vehicle tax credits. \u201cHe just went CRAZY!\u201d\nAs Musk\u2019s drama engulfed the party Thursday, Republicans in Congress mostly tried to avoid getting caught in the crossfire. Key GOP lawmakers in both chambers worked to downplay the potential effects on both the party\u2019s domestic policy package and on the GOP\u2019s midterms posture.\nRep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.), who leads the House GOP campaign arm, told reporters Thursday that he hopes the spat will \u201cblow over.\u201d Before the breakup went nuclear, Hudson had said in a brief interview Wednesday evening that Musk has \u201cbeen a friend and he\u2019s just wrong about this bill.\u201d\nEven fiscal hard-liners who have embraced some of Musk\u2019s talking points about the bill tried to avoid getting drawn into the fracas. Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), who at one point threatened to tank the megabill for not being fiscally conservative enough, said, \u201cElon crossed the line today ... we\u2019ll let those guys go play it out.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t disagree with him about our need to find more spending cuts,\u201d Roy added, but Musk needs to \u201ckeep it in the lines.\u201d\nAnother hard-liner, Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.), said he believes Musk is losing sway within MAGA. Musk is \u201cjust another shiny object,\u201d he said, \u201cand we\u2019ll deal with it.\u201d\nBut Musk appeared intent on turning his opposition to the legislation into a civil war for the party. He amplified two Kentucky Republicans, Rep. Thomas Massie and Sen. Rand Paul, who have been thorns in the side of Trump and GOP leaders trying to pass the bill.\nEven though Musk brought massive financial backing, he has also at times been an electoral problem for Republicans. His popularity has fallen below Trump\u2019s, and his biggest political effort this year \u2014 the Wisconsin Supreme Court race \u2014 ended with the conservative candidate losing by almost 10 points.\n\u201cElon couldn\u2019t buy a Wisconsin Supreme Court seat. You really think that people are gonna be afraid of this money?\u201d said a person close to the White House, granted anonymity to discuss the dynamics.\nAs Musk\u2019s popularity faded, Republicans wondered how long his relationship with Trump could endure. On Thursday, Musk severed ties.\nHe took shot after shot at Trump, accusing him of lying, replying \u201cyes\u201d to a post suggesting he should be impeached, and accusing him of having a cozy relationship with the deceased Jeffrey Epstein, who had been accused of sex trafficking.\n\u201cWhat a predictable shitshow,\u201d said a person who has been in the room with both Musk and Trump. \u201cTrump is a liar, and it was obvious Elon would not be able to go along with his incessant lying forever.\u201d\nA nervous Republican Party is now scrambling to figure out what the electoral fallout will look like, starting with next year\u2019s midterms.\nAlready, two of Trump\u2019s top campaign operatives, Chris LaCivita and Tony Fabrizio had signed up to work with Musk\u2019s Building America\u2019s Future PAC. But Musk\u2019s scorched-earth strategy could create dueling allegiances.\nPrivately, some Republicans are arguing they had already been preparing for next year\u2019s elections without Musk\u2019s money, and complained that America PAC \u2014 the tech billionaire\u2019s super PAC \u2014 didn\u2019t spend its money effectively in House races last year.\nAmerica PAC spent $19.2 million backing GOP candidates across 18 battleground House races last year, according to data from the Federal Election Commission. Republicans won 10 of those elections. But those were among the highest-profile and most expensive races in the country, and Musk\u2019s group accounted for only 12 percent of Republican outside spending in them.

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)\nAs Congress continues its investigation into the role AI should play in government, members of the House Oversight Committee are questioning the uses and procurement of AI tools for government work, as well as the privacy concerns the technology poses when unregulated.\nExpert witnesses testified at a June 5 hearing that the federal government is currently using AI in some capacities, but several factors, such as the government\u2019s outdated technology systems and data practices, could keep federal workers from using the technology to its full potential. They also said the government\u2019s current procurement practices for AI technology slow its adoption, which risks other countries taking the lead in the global AI race.\n\u201cThe question before us is not whether the federal government should adopt AI, it\u2019s whether we will lead or follow,\u201d Bhavin Shah, founder and CEO of Moveworks, an AI company that contracts with both private companies and local governments.\nMany federal departments are using AI that has been approved under the current procurement standards, like The Department of Health and Human Services, which uses AI in medical research and tracking disease outbreaks, and the Department of Veterans Affairs, which uses AI to help analyze medical records and data to predict risk-related incidents of suicide.\nShah said in his testimony that the federal government workers \u201cdeserve\u201d the same quick access to AI-powered tools that the private sector is using to maintain efficiency and cost savings. He said Moveworks spent three and a half years and $8.5 million to achieve FedRAMP status, the standardized approach the federal government uses to assess security of cloud-based tools.\n\u201cThis is a prohibitive barrier for smaller AI innovators, the companies that often develop the most cutting-edge solutions,\u201d Shah said.\nYlli Bajraktari, president and CEO of tech-focused think tank Special Competitive Studies Project, said that while the U.S. still leads in AI research, the slow adoption of AI into government use is our \u201cprimary disadvantage,\u201d against countries like China.\n\u201cWe are hampered by bureaucratic inertia, outdated IT infrastructure and a lack of AI literacy in the workforce,\u201d Bajraktari said. \u201cOvercoming these barriers is the key to winning the global tech competition.\u201d\nBajraktari\u2019s suggestions to the committee included establishing a \u201cspace race\u201d style council for AI in the White House, increasing non-defense AI research and development spending to $32 billion and launching a targeted AI talent strategy that would promote AI literacy and attract top STEM talent from abroad. He also suggested overhauling the procurement process to more quickly integrate AI into government systems and strengthening global alliances in AI and cybersecurity.\nBut the oversimplification and speedy adoption of AI in government is a major security and data privacy risk, testified Bruce Schneier, a fellow and lecturer at the Harvard Kennedy School. Schneier warned congressmembers that recent actions by Elon Musk \u2014 who just stepped down as the leader of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, this week \u2014 highlight the dangers of unfettered AI use.\nIn February, Musk said the DOGE team was using AI to help make decisions about federal workers\u2019 jobs. DOGE also reportedly had gained access to sensitive data from various federal departments, like the Treasury Department payment system, Social Security and other demographic data. In April, 48 lawmakers expressed their concerns with Musk using unauthorized AI systems on these and other datasets.\nMusk\u2019s actions go against what the committee aimed to do, Schneier said, which is release AI responsibly, and protect the interests and rights of Americans. Americans\u2019 data has been consolidated and fed to non-vetted AI models, he said, which poses national security risks.\n\u201cYou all need to assume that our adversaries have copies of all the data DOGE has exfiltrated and have established access into all the networks that DOGE has removed security controls from,\u201d Schneier said. \u201cAnd your data can be used against you.\u201d\nMusk\u2019s actions and access to Americans\u2019 data, and his reported drug use, were the center of a 40-minute debate before the June 5 hearing, where Republicans once again blocked Democrats in a 21-20 vote to attempt to force Musk to testify before Congress.\n\u201cHe\u2019s dismantled our government, endangered Americans and weaponized public service for his own financial gain,\u201d said Rep. Stephen Lynch a Democrat from Massachusets and the acting ranking member of the House Oversight Committee.\nLinda Miller, founder and chief growth officer at TrackLight, a platform that performs fraud detection for government programs, said in her testimony that DOGE\u2019s actions are an example of why it\u2019s challenging to impose private sector innovation on governments.\n\u201cMy fellow panelists have made some very smart suggestions about turbocharging the rip and replace efforts of legacy IT systems and removing procurement barriers, but we have to be realistic about how capable government is to enact these rapid changes, no matter how badly they\u2019re needed,\u201d she said.\nMiller said the best uses of AI in government work today should be automating routine processes and repetitive tasks, which would free federal workers up for more high level work. She recommended that to speed AI adoption, Congress may consider supporting \u201cregulatory sandboxes\u201d \u2014 controlled environments where AI systems can be tried and tested under supervision of regulators before they are released at scale.\n\u201cWholesale changes to legacy IT systems and the federal acquisition system will take years, but we can create innovative laboratories where AI projects can operate in proof of concept regulatory sandboxes, in carefully controlled environments, to start to show the art of the possible,\u201d Miller said.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

Meta invests in AI firm Scale and recruits its CEO for 'superintelligence' team\nMeta is making a $14.3 billion investment in artificial intelligence company Scale and recruiting its CEO Alexandr Wang to join a team developing \u201csuperintelligence\u201d at the tech giant\nMeta is making a $14.3 billion investment in artificial intelligence company Scale and recruiting its CEO Alexandr Wang to join a team developing \u201csuperintelligence\u201d at the tech giant.\nThe deal announced Thursday reflects a push by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to revive AI efforts at the parent company of Facebook and Instagram as it faces tough competition from rivals such as Google and OpenAI.\nMeta announced what it called a \u201cstrategic partnership and investment\u201d with Scale late Thursday. Scale said the $14.3 billion investment puts its market value at over $29 billion.\nScale said it will remain an independent company but the agreement will \u201csubstantially expand Scale and Meta\u2019s commercial relationship.\u201d Meta will hold a 49% stake in the startup.\nWang, though leaving for Meta with a small group of other Scale employees, will remain on Scale\u2019s board of directors. Replacing him is a new interim Scale CEO Jason Droege, who was previously the company\u2019s chief strategy officer and had past executive roles at Uber Eats and Axon.\nZuckerberg's increasing focus on the abstract idea of \u201csuperintelligence\u201d \u2014 which rival companies call artificial general intelligence, or AGI \u2014 is the latest pivot for a tech leader who in 2021 went all-in on the idea of the metaverse, changing the company's name and investing billions into advancing virtual reality and related technology.\nIt won't be the first time since ChatGPT's 2022 debut sparked an AI arms race that a big tech company has gobbled up talent and products at innovative AI startups without formally acquiring them. Microsoft hired key staff from startup Inflection AI, including co-founder and CEO Mustafa Suleyman, who now runs Microsoft's AI division.\nGoogle pulled in the leaders of AI chatbot company Character.AI, while Amazon made a deal with San Francisco-based Adept that sent its CEO and key employees to the e-commerce giant. Amazon also got a license to Adept\u2019s AI systems and datasets.\nWang was a 19-year-old student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology when he and co-founder Lucy Guo started Scale in 2016.\nThey won influential backing that summer from the startup incubator Y Combinator, which was led at the time by Sam Altman, now the CEO of OpenAI. Wang dropped out of MIT, following a trajectory similar to that of Zuckerberg, who quit Harvard University to start Facebook more than a decade earlier.\nScale's pitch was to supply the human labor needed to improve AI systems, hiring workers to draw boxes around a pedestrian or a dog in a street photo so that self-driving cars could better predict what's in front of them. General Motors and Toyota have been among Scale's customers.\nWhat Scale offered to AI developers was a more tailored version of Amazon's Mechanical Turk, which had long been a go-to service for matching freelance workers with temporary online jobs.\nMore recently, the growing commercialization of AI large language models \u2014 the technology behind OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini and Meta's Llama \u2014 brought a new market for Scale's annotation teams. The company claims to service \u201cevery leading large language model,\u201d including from Anthropic, OpenAI, Meta and Microsoft, by helping to fine tune their training data and test their performance. It's not clear what the Meta deal will mean for Scale's other customers.\nWang has also sought to build close relationships with the U.S. government, winning military contracts to supply AI tools to the Pentagon and attending President Donald Trump's inauguration. The head of Trump's science and technology office, Michael Kratsios, was an executive at Scale for the four years between Trump's first and second terms. Meta has also begun providing AI services to the federal government.\nMeta has taken a different approach to AI than many of its rivals, releasing its flagship Llama system for free as an open-source product that enables people to use and modify some of its key components. Meta says more than a billion people use its AI products each month, but it's also widely seen as lagging behind competitors such as OpenAI and Google in encouraging consumer use of large language models, also known as LLMs.\nIt hasn't yet released its purportedly most advanced model, Llama 4 Behemoth, despite previewing it in April as \"one of the smartest LLMs in the world and our most powerful yet.\u201d\nMeta's chief AI scientist Yann LeCun, who in 2019 was a winner of computer science's top prize for his pioneering AI work, has expressed skepticism about the tech industry's current focus on large language models.\n\u201cHow do we build AI systems that understand the physical world, that have persistent memory, that can reason and can plan?\u201d LeCun asked at a French tech conference last year.\nThese are all characteristics of intelligent behavior that large language models \u201cbasically cannot do, or they can only do them in a very superficial, approximate way,\u201d LeCun said.\nInstead, he emphasized Meta's interest in \u201ctracing a path towards human-level AI systems, or perhaps even superhuman.\u201d When he returned to France's annual VivaTech conference again on Wednesday, LeCun dodged a question about the pending Scale deal but said his AI research team's plan has \u201calways been to reach human intelligence and go beyond it.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just that now we have a clearer vision for how to accomplish this,\u201d he said.\nLeCun co-founded Meta's AI research division more than a decade ago with Rob Fergus, a fellow professor at New York University. Fergus later left for Google but returned to Meta last month after a 5-year absence to run the research lab, replacing longtime director Joelle Pineau.\nFergus wrote on LinkedIn last month that Meta's commitment to long-term AI research \u201cremains unwavering\u201d and described the work as \u201cbuilding human-level experiences that transform the way we interact with technology.\u201d", "Here's what CEOs are telling their employees about how to use AI &mdash; and how not to lose their jobs to it. - Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said \"efficiency gains\" from AI would mean fewer workers at the company.\n- AI's impact on jobs has been hotly debated as it completes or accelerates certain tasks.\n- CEOs have previously given advice on how to survive the AI revolution.\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy has told employees that \"efficiency gains\" from AI would reduce the company's \"total corporate workforce\" in the next few years.\nJassy may be the most prominent CEO to say AI is coming for people's jobs, but he's far from the first.\nThis is the advice CEOs have been giving about how to use AI \u2014 and avoid losing your job as a tech revolution threatens to reinvent the world of work.\nFiverr CEO Micha Kaufman: Become exceptional at what you do\nMicha Kaufman, CEO of Fiverr, one of the world's largest freelance marketplaces, warned in an email to his team that: \"AI is coming for your jobs. Heck, it's coming for my job too.

I see it as a tool to accelerate what we do, at the same or better level of quality. And the sooner we learn how to use it, and use it responsibly, the better off we will be in the long run.\"\nLowe's CEO Marvin Ellison: 'Stay close to the cash register'\nLowe's CEO Marvin Ellison said his advice was to \"stay as close to the cash register as you can.\"\n\"When young people come to me and they desire to work in the corporate office, my advice to them is: stay as close to the cash register as you can,\" Ellison said at a Business Roundtable forum in DC this month.\n\"Stay close to the customers, because you will always have employment opportunities to grow,\" he added.\nHe also said, \"AI isn't going to fix a hole in your roof.\"\n\"It's not going to respond to an electrical issue in your home. It's not going to stop your water heater from leaking,\" he said.\nLinkedIn CEO Reid Hoffman: Show off your AI skills to employers\n\"You are generation AI,\" LinkedIn CEO Reid Hoffman said in a video in which he answered questions from college students on how they should navigate the job hunt.\n\"You are AI native, so bringing the fact that you have AI in your tool set is one of the things that makes you enormously attractive,\" he added.\nHoffman said that AI's impact on jobs was a \"legitimate worry,\" but he added that students could try to use it to their advantage.\n\"Look, on this side, it's transforming the workspace, entry-level work, employers' confusion,\" he said. \"But on this side, it's making you able to show your unique capabilities.\"\n\"In an environment with a bunch of older people, you might be able to help them out,\" he added.\nLattice CEO Sarah Franklin: Bosses should give workers AI to do jobs without feeling swamped\nLattice boss Sarah Franklin told Business Insider that corporate leaders should be focused on how AI can help with efficiency.\nThe HR software company CEO said this includes using AI to give employees \"superpowers to where they feel like they're stepping into the Iron Man suit\" and accomplishing what they need to in their jobs without feeling swamped.\nShe said that might include using AI to give each employee at a company an executive assistant or a coach."]}, {"topic": 8, "name": "Immigration Raids and Civil Unrest in Los Angeles", "keywords": "los, angeles, protests, immigration, police, and, guard, of, the, people", "documents": ["LA-area mayors demand Trump administration stop intensified immigration raids.

The dire wolf, a large, wolflike species that went extinct about 12,000 years ago, has been in the news after biotech company Colossal claimed to have resurrected it using cloning and gene-editing technologies. Colossal calls itself a \u201cde-extinction\u201d company. The very concept of de-extinction is a lightning rod for criticism. There are broad accusations of playing God or messing with nature, as well as more focused objections that contemporary de-extinction tools create poor imitations rather than truly resurrected species. WATCH MORE: The tough decision of which species to save from extinction While the biological and philosophical debates are interesting, the legal ramifications for endangered species conservation are of paramount importance.

But it needs to work in harmony with both the letter and purpose of the laws governing biodiversity conservation. Of dire wolves and de-extinction What did Colossal actually do? Scientists extracted and sequenced DNA from Ice Age-era bones to understand the genetic makeup of the dire wolf. They were able to piece together around 90% of a complete dire wolf genome. While the gray wolf and the dire wolf are separated by a few million years of evolution, they share over 99.5% of their genomes. WATCH: A Brief But Spectacular take on the future of CRISPR The scientists scanned the recovered dire wolf sequences for specific genes that they believed were responsible for the physical and ecological differences between dire wolves and other species of canids, including genes related to body size and coat color. CRISPR gene-editing technology allows scientists to make specific changes in the DNA of an organism. The Colossal team used CRISPR to make 20 changes in 14 different genes in a modern gray wolf cell before implanting the embryo into a surrogate mother.

They point out that it would take far more than 20 edits to bridge the gap left by millions of years of evolution. For instance, that 0.5% of the genome that doesn\u2019t match in the two species represents over 12 million base pair differences. More philosophically, perhaps, other skeptics argue that a species is more than a collection of genes devoid of environmental, ecological or evolutionary context. WATCH: How CRISPR gene editing puts scientists in the driver\u2019s seat of evolution Colossal, on the other hand, maintains that it is in the \u201cfunctional de-extinction\u201d game.

Deciding what counts as an endangered \u2018species\u2019 In the United States, the Endangered Species Act is the main tool for protecting biodiversity. To be protected by the act, an organism must be a member of an endangered or threatened species.

WATCH: What the Endangered Species Act has accomplished in 50 years Colossal\u2019s functional species concept is anathema to the Endangered Species Act. It shrinks the value of a species down to the way it looks or the way it functions. When passing the act, however, Congress made clear that species were to be valued for their \u201caesthetic, ecological, educational, historical, recreational, and scientific value to the Nation and its people.\u201d In my view, the myopic focus on function seems to miss the point. Despite its insistence otherwise, Colossal\u2019s definitional sleight of hand has opened the door to arguments that people should reduce conservation funding or protections for currently imperiled species.

Putting biotechnology to work for conservation Biotechnology can provide real conservation benefits for today\u2019s endangered species.

Unlike the dire wolf, the red wolf is not extinct, though it came extremely close. After decades of conservation efforts, there are about a dozen red wolves in the wild in the reintroduced population in eastern North Carolina, as well as a few hundred red wolves in captivity.

The estimated population of 16 penguin colonies \u2014 visible in satellite photos taken between 2009 and 2024 \u2013 had declined 22% during that period mainly because of climate change that\u2019s shrinking the amount of available sea ice.

Scientists previously estimated that the total emperor penguin population declined about 10% across all of Antarctica over the past decade and a half.

There are uncertainties in the latest estimate. The analysis relies on a calculation of how densely the penguins are clustered in each area where they\u2019re detected in a single satellite photo taken each year. The colonies studied represent about 30% of the total emperor penguin population, which lives only in Antarctica. The loss of stable sea ice may be affecting the penguins in ways beyond shrinking their breeding grounds. \u201cMore predators like leopard seals and orcas may be able to come in closer to the colonies if sea ice breaks up earlier in the year,\u201d said Fretwell. Warming ocean temperatures and changing rainfall patterns may also impact the survival of penguin chicks, he added.

Search and recovery teams continued scouring the site of one of India\u2019s worst aviation disasters for a third day after the Air India flight fell from the sky and killed at least 270 people in Gujarat state, officials said Saturday.\nThe London-bound Boeing 787 struck a medical college hostel in a residential area of the northwestern city of Ahmedabad minutes after takeoff Thursday, killing 241 people on board and at least 29 on the ground. One passenger survived.\nRecovery teams working until late Friday found at least 25 more bodies in the debris, officials said.\nDr. Dhaval Gameti at the Civil Hospital in Ahmedabad told The Associated Press the facility had received 270 bodies, adding that the lone surviving passenger was still under observation for some of his wounds.\n\u201cHe is doing very well and will be ready to be discharged anytime soon,\u201d Gameti said Saturday.\nHundreds of relatives of the crash victims have provided DNA samples at the hospital. Most bodies were charred or mutilated, making them unrecognizable.\nSome relatives expressed frustration Saturday that the process was taking too long. Authorities say it normally takes up to 72 hours to complete DNA matching and they are expediting the process.\n\u201cWhere are my children? Did you recover them?\u201d asked Rafiq Abdullah, whose nephew, daughter-in-law and two grandchildren were on the flight. \u201cI will have to ask questions. Government is not answering these questions.\u201d\nAnother relative persistently asked hospital staff when his relative\u2019s body would be handed over to the family for last rites.\n\u201cGive us the body,\u201d the relative insisted.\nAlongside the formal investigation, the Indian government says it has formed a high-level, multi-disciplinary committee to examine the causes leading to the crash.\nThe committee will focus on formulating procedures to prevent and handle aircraft emergencies in the future and \u201cwill not be a substitute to other enquiries being conducted by relevant organizations,\u201d the Ministry of Civil Aviation said in a statement.\nAuthorities have begun inspecting Air India\u2019s entire fleet of Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft, Indian Minister of Civil Aviation Ram Mohan Naidu Kinjarapu said Saturday in New Delhi at his first news briefing since Thursday\u2019s crash.\nEight of the 34 Dreamliner aircraft in India have already undergone inspection, Kinjarapu said, adding that the remaining aircraft will be examined with \u201cimmediate urgency.\u201d\nThe government is eagerly awaiting results of the crash investigation by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau and all necessary steps will be taken without hesitation, Kinjarapu said.\nInvestigators on Friday recovered the plane\u2019s digital flight data recorder, or the black box, which was recovered from a rooftop near the crash site and likely will lead to clues about the cause of the accident.\nIndia\u2019s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau said it had started working with \u201cfull force\u201d to extract the data.\nThe device is expected to reveal information about the engine and control settings, while the voice recorder will provide cockpit conversations, said Paul Fromme, a mechanical engineer with the U.K.-based Institution of Mechanical Engineers.\nAviation safety consultant Jeff Guzzetti, a former crash investigator for both the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration, said investigators should be able to answer some important questions about what caused the crash as soon as next week as long as the flight data recorder is in good shape.\nInvestigators likely are looking at whether wing flaps were set correctly, the engine lost power, alarms were going off inside the cockpit and if the plane\u2019s crew correctly logged information about the hot temperature outside and the weight of the fuel and passengers, Guzzetti said.\nMistakes in the data could result in the wing flaps being set incorrectly, he said.\nThursday\u2019s Air India crash involved a 12-year-old Boeing 787. Boeing planes have been plagued by safety issues on other types of aircraft.\nThere are currently around 1,200 of the 787 Dreamliner aircraft worldwide and this was the first deadly crash in 16 years of operation, according to experts.", "One passenger survived Air India plane crash that killed at least 240 others.

Previous crashes in India The last major passenger plane crash in India was in 2020, when an Air India Express Boeing-737 skidded off a hilltop runway in southern India, killing 21 people. The worst air disaster in India was on Nov. 12, 1996, when a Saudi Arabian Airlines flight collided midair with a Kazakhstan Airlines Flight near Charki Dadri in Haryana state, killing all 349 on board the two planes. The crash comes days before the opening of the Paris Air Show, a major aviation expo where Boeing and European rival Airbus will showcase their aircraft and battle for jet orders from airline customers. Boeing has been in recovery mode for more than six years after Lion Air Flight 610, a Boeing 737 Max 8, plunged into the Java Sea off the coast of Indonesia minutes after takeoff from Jakarta, killing all 189 people on board. Five months later, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, a Boeing 737 Max 8, crashed after takeoff from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, killing 157 passengers and crew members. Shares of Boeing Co. tumbled nearly 9% before trading opened in the U.S. Roy reported from New Delhi.

Boeing said it was \u201cworking to gather more information.\u201d India\u2019s aviation regulatory body said the aircraft gave a mayday call, signaling an emergency, but then did not respond to the calls made by the airport traffic control. Aviation consultant John M. Cox, the CEO of Safety Operating Systems, told the AP from Los Angeles that while the first images of the crash were poor, it appeared the aircraft had its nose up and was not climbing, which is one of the things that investigators would look at. \u201cAt this point, it\u2019s very, very, very early; we don\u2019t know a whole lot,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the 787 has very extensive flight data monitoring \u2014 the parameters on the flight data recorder are in the thousands \u2014 so once we get that recorder, they\u2019ll be able to know pretty quickly what happened.\u201d The wide-body, twin-engine aircraft was introduced in 2009, and more than 1,000 have been delivered to dozens of airlines, according to the flightradar24 website. Air India\u2019s chairman, Natarajan Chandrasekaran, said that at the moment \u201cour primary focus is on supporting all the affected people and their families.\u201d UK promises support A family member cries upon hearing the news of her brother who died when the Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner plane crashed June 12 in Ahmedabad, India.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the crash \u201cdevastating\u201d and British Cabinet minister Lucy Powell said the government will provide \u201call the support that it can\u201d to those affected by the crash. \u201cThis is an unfolding story, and it will undoubtedly be causing a huge amount of worry and concern to the many, many families and communities here and those waiting for the arrival of their loved ones,\u201d she told lawmakers in the House of Commons. \u201cWe send our deepest sympathy and thoughts to all those families, and the government will provide all the support that it can with those in India and those in this country as well,\u201d she added. Britain has very close ties with India. There were nearly 1.9 million people in the country of Indian descent, according to the 2021 U.K. census. Condolences also poured in from King Charles III, who said he and his wife, Queen Camilla, were \u201cdesperately shocked\u201d by the crash. \u201cOur special prayers and deepest possible sympathy are with the families and friends of all those affected by this appallingly tragic incident across so many nations,\u201d he said in a statement. Previous crashes in India The last major passenger plane crash in India was in 2020, when an Air India Express Boeing-737 skidded off a hilltop runway in southern India, killing 21 people. The worst air disaster in India was on Nov. 12, 1996, when a Saudi Arabian Airlines flight collided midair with a Kazakhstan Airlines Flight near Charki Dadri in Haryana state, killing all 349 on board the two planes. The crash comes days before the opening of the Paris Air Show, a major aviation expo where Boeing and European rival Airbus will showcase their aircraft and battle for jet orders from airline customers. Boeing has been in recovery mode for more than six years after Lion Air Flight 610, a Boeing 737 Max 8, plunged into the Java Sea off the coast of Indonesia minutes after takeoff from Jakarta, killing all 189 people on board. Five months later, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, a Boeing 737 Max 8, crashed after takeoff from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, killing 157 passengers and crew members.

China has spent decades building the world\u2019s main industrial chain for mining and processing such materials, which are used in many industries such as electronics, advanced manufacturing, defense and health care. Mines and factories in and around Ganzhou, a key production hub for rare earths, underpin China\u2019s control over the minerals. Many residents grew up collecting rocks containing the valuable minerals from the forested hills surrounding the southern city and today make a living from mining, trading or processing them. Critical minerals as a trade issue Responding to ever higher tariffs and other controls on advanced technology, China told exporters of certain key rare earths and other critical minerals to obtain licenses for every shipment abroad. Approvals can take weeks, leading to supply chain disruptions in the U.S. and other countries. President Donald Trump said Wednesday that China would make it easier for American industry to obtain much-needed needed magnets and rare earth minerals, clearing the way for talks to continue between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. In return, Trump said, the U.S. will stop efforts to revoke the visas of Chinese nationals on U.S. college campuses. But details remain scarce. Beijing has not confirmed what the negotiators agreed to, and Chinese President Xi Jinping and Trump himself have yet to sign off on it. The Chinese Commerce Ministry said Saturday it had approved a \u201ccertain number\u201d of export licenses for rare earth products, apparently acknowledging Trump\u2019s personal request to Xi during a phone call last week. And on Wednesday, the Ganzhou-based rare-earth conglomerate JL MAG Rare-Earth Co. confirmed it had obtained some export licenses for shipments to destinations including the U.S., Europe and Southeast Asia. Experts say, however, Beijing is unlikely to do away with the permit system enabling it to control access to those valuable resources. \u201cI think what the Chinese have proven is they have now created an entire export control regime for rare earths,\u201d said Daniel Kritenbrink, a partner at The Asia Group consultancy. \u201cThey can turn that spigot on and off at will.\u201d The only scenario in which China might deregulate its critical minerals export is if the U.S. fully removes tariffs imposed on Chinese goods as part of the trade war, said Wang Yiwei, a professor of international affairs at Renmin University, echoing the Chinese government\u2019s earlier stance. \u201cWithout that,\u201d he said, \u201cit will be difficult to blame China for continuing to strengthen its export controls.\u201d An industry built over decades with government support In 1992, Deng Xiaoping, the leader who launched China\u2019s ascent as the world\u2019s biggest manufacturing power, famously said \u201cthe Middle East has oil, China has rare earths,\u201d signaling a desire to leverage access to the key minerals. Several generations later, Beijing has made its rich reserves of rare earths, a group of 17 minerals that are abundant in the earth\u2019s crust but hard, expensive and environmentally polluting to process, a key element of China\u2019s economic security. In 2019, during a visit to a rare earth processing plant in Ganzhou, Xi described rare earths as a \u201cvital strategic resource.\u201d China today has an essential monopoly over \u201cheavy rare earths,\u201d used for making powerful, heat-resistance magnets used in industries such as defense and electric vehicles. READ MORE: Trump says U.S. will get rare earth minerals from China and tariffs on Chinese goods will total 55% under new trade framework The country also produces around 80% of the world\u2019s tungsten, gallium and antimony, and 60% of the world\u2019s germanium -\u2013 all minerals used in the making of semiconductors, among other advanced technologies. The risks of dependency on Chinese suppliers first came into focus in 2010, when Beijing suspended rare earths exports to Japan due to a territorial dispute. The ban was lifted after about two months, but as a precaution, Japan invested in rare earths processing plants in other countries and began stockpiling the materials. Beijing\u2019s across-the-board requirement for export licenses for some critical minerals has put pressure on world electronics manufacturers and automakers. Some auto parts makers in Europe have shut down production lines due to delays in supply deliveries, according to the European Association of Automotive Suppliers. In the U.S., Tesla CEO Elon Musk said a shortage of rare earths is affecting his company\u2019s work on humanoid robots. China\u2019s critical minerals resources are dwindling In the drab industrial hub of Ganzhou, cradled by the scenic Dayu Mountains, the U.S.-China trade war is still a distant stressor. Miners and small mineral traders interviewed by The Associated Press said they are more concerned about depleting the mountains\u2019 once-abundant resources. Zhong, a tungsten factory manager in Ganzhou who would only give his last name, worked his way up to manager from a miner, but he\u2019s unsure there is a future for him and others in the industry. \u201cI find growing difficulties to source tungsten these days,\u201d he said, adding that smaller mines and trading companies are slowly disappearing as the resources are dwindling. Tungsten is an ultra-hard metal used in armor-piercing ammunition, nuclear reactors and semiconductors. At least five tungsten mines have closed in the area in recent years, according to state media. Remaining reserves are deeper and harder to extract and process after decades of exploitation, said Li Shangkui, chairman of the Ganzhou-based Jiangxi Yuean Advanced Materials Co., Ltd. Processing factories in Ganzhou now routinely source materials from other provinces or other countries. Zhong\u2019s plant imports some raw materials from places like Africa and Cambodia. Major state-owned and private companies in Ganzhou are also ramping up investments abroad. Tungsten producer Ganzhou Haisheng, for instance, announced last year a $25 million investment in a new tungsten plant in Thailand. Whatever the challenges in procuring raw materials, China likely will seek to maintain its dominance in critical minerals, said Fabian Villalobos, an engineer and critical minerals expert at the RAND think tank. The U.S. lags far behind China on critical minerals Between 2020 and 2023, the U.S. imported at least 70% of the rare earth compounds it used from China, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. It has diversified its sources in recent years, but still mainly relies on China. Since beginning his second term in office, Trump has made improving access to critical minerals a matter of national security. But the U.S. has an incredibly long way to go to catch up with China, experts say. The sole operational U.S. rare earths mine, in Mountain Pass, California, is unable to separate heavy rare earths. It sends its ore to China for processing. The U.S. Defense Department has provided funding to the mine\u2019s owner, MP Materials, to build new separation facilities. It will take months to build and still only produce a fraction of what is needed. Friction over the issue has opened the way for government-backed financing that was unavailable before, said Mark Smith, who ran the Mountain Pass mine in the early 2010s and now leads NioCorp. It\u2019s seeking about $780 million in financing through the U.S. Export-Import Bank to build a processing facility in Nebraska for critical minerals including rare earths. The Defense Department has committed $439 million to building domestic rare earth supply chains, but building a complete mining and processing industrial chain like China\u2019s could take decades. \u201cThere are going to be some real issues here unless we can figure out how to get along with China for a period of time while we\u2019re developing our own resources and our mainstream processing,\u201d Smith said. The spotlight on critical minerals also provides opportunities for smaller miners to invest in extracting and processing some critical minerals, such as tungsten, considered \u201cniche\u201d because they are needed in relatively small amounts in key industries, said Milo McBride, an expert on sustainability and geopolitics at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \u201cFor many of these companies, the business strategy hedges on a scenario where the U.S. and China become more confrontational and where trade relations become more uncomfortable,\u201d McBride said. \u201cAnd all of a sudden, what was once an uneconomic project somewhere outside of China starts to make more sense.\u201d Associated Press news researcher Shihuan Chen contributed to this story.

Beijing has not confirmed what the negotiators agreed to, and Chinese President Xi Jinping and Trump himself have yet to sign off on it.

Jamieson Greer. Leading the Chinese delegation was Vice Premier He Lifeng. Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has deployed tariffs aggressively, seeing them as a way to raise money for the federal government, protect American industries, lure factories back to the United States and pressure other countries into bending to his will. He has imposed baseline 10% tariffs on imports from almost every country on earth after having introduced and then suspended for 90 days bigger tariffs on countries based on the size of U.S. trade deficits last year. To American trading partners and to businesses calculating their import tax bills, the president\u2019s mercurial approach to trade policy can be baffling. For example, he recently doubled his steel and aluminum tariffs to 50%, likely increasing costs for U.S. manufacturers and construction companies that rely on the metals as raw materials. Likewise, he threatened a 50% tariff on the European Union under the belief that it would jumpstart talks with the bloc, only to back down as his self-imposed 90-day negotiating period is set to expire around July 9. But his approach to China has been especially bewildering. After imposing a 20% tariff on Chinese imports, the American president quickly upped the ante, raising the levy to 54% to offset what he said were China\u2019s unfair trade practices. Then, enraged when China retaliated with tariffs of its own, he increased those levies to a staggering 145%. Beijing counterpunched with 125% tariffs on U.S. imports. Those triple-digit tariffs threatened to effectively end trade between the United States and China, causing a hair-raising selloff in financial markets. At a meeting in Geneva last month, the two countries agreed to back off: America\u2019s tariffs went back down to a still-high 30% and China\u2019s to 10%. In April, the Chinese announced licensing requirements that slowed the supply of desperately needed rare earth minerals to the United States. Furious about the move, Trump threatened to call off the Geneva arrangement, setting the stage for talks Monday and Tuesday in London. And there the Chinese agreed to speed up the rare earths shipments. The agreement came as an international rights group said that several global brands are among dozens of companies at risk of using forced labor through their Chinese supply chains because they use critical minerals or buy minerals-based products sourced from the far-western Xinjiang region of China. The report by the Netherlands-based Global Rights Compliance says companies including Avon, Walmart, Nescafe, Coca-Cola and Sherwin-Williams may be linked to titanium sourced from Xinjiang, where rights groups allege the Chinese government runs coercive labor practices targeting predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other Turkic minorities.

In return, Trump said, the U.S. will stop efforts to revoke the visas of Chinese nationals on U.S. college campuses. Trump\u2019s comment on social media came after two days of high-level U.S.-China trade talks in London. Details remain scarce. Trump didn\u2019t fully spell out what concessions the U.S. made. Beijing has not confirmed what the negotiators agreed to, and Chinese President Xi Jinping and Trump himself have yet to sign off on it. What Trump described as a \u201cdeal\u2019\u2019 is actually less than that: It\u2019s a \u201cframework\u2019\u2019 meant to set the stage for more substantive talks. And Trump\u2019s own comments created confusion about what was happening to his taxes \u2013 tariffs \u2014 on Chinese imports, generating uncertainty about more than $660 billion in annual trade between the two countries.

Lander\u2019s detainment comes a little more than a month after Newark, New Jersey, Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested on a trespassing charge outside a federal immigration detention center in his city. The charge was later dropped by interim U.S. Attorney for New Jersey Alina Habba, and Baraka\u2019s fellow Democrat, Rep.

Alex Padilla, a California Democrat, speaks on the Senate floor on June 17, 2025, about how he was forcibly removed from a press conference with the secretary of Homeland Security. (Screenshot from Senate webcast)\nWASHINGTON \u2014 U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, a California Democrat who was forcibly removed from a press conference with the secretary of Homeland Security, said Tuesday that his home state is the testing ground for President Donald Trump\u2019s push to deploy the military within the United States.\nTrump is using immigrants in the country without legal status as scapegoats to send in troops, said Padilla, who in a speech on the Senate floor choked up as he related how he was wrestled to the ground by law enforcement officials. \u201cI refuse to let immigrants be political pawns on his path toward fascism,\u201d Padilla said.\nIt\u2019s the first floor speech the senior senator from California has given since the highly publicized incident in Los Angeles last week. The Secret Service handcuffed Padilla after he tried to question Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who was defending to reporters Trump\u2019s decision to send 4,000 National Guard members and 700 Marines to LA.\nTrump sent in the troops following multi-day protests over Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids and against California Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s wishes. An appeals court Tuesday is hearing arguments on a suit by California contending that the president unlawfully took control of the state National Guard.\n\u201cHe wants the spectacle,\u201d Padilla said of the president. \u201cTo justify his undemocratic crackdown and his authoritarian power grab.\u201d\nThe LA protests were sparked after ICE targeted Home Depots, places where undocumented day laborers typically search for work, for immigration raids.\nArrests, confrontations\nThe Padilla incident, widely captured on video, was a stark escalation of the tensions between Democratic lawmakers and the administration over Trump\u2019s drive to enact mass deportations.\nA Democratic House member from New Jersey is facing federal charges on allegations that she shoved immigration officials while protesting the opening of an immigrant detention center in Newark. And on Tuesday, in New York City, ICE officers arrested city comptroller and mayoral candidate Brad Lander while he was escorting an immigrant to their hearing in immigration court, according to The Associated Press.\nIn a statement to States Newsroom, DHS Assistant Secretary of Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said Lander \u201cwas arrested for assaulting law enforcement and impeding a federal officer.\u201d\n\u201cNo one is above the law, and if you lay a hand on a law enforcement officer, you will face consequences,\u201d McLaughlin said.\nThe president late Sunday directed ICE to conduct immigration raids in New York, LA and Chicago, the nation\u2019s three most populous cities, all led by elected Democrats in heavily Democratic states.\n\u201cWe will follow the President\u2019s direction and continue to work to get the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens off of America\u2019s streets,\u201d McLaughlin said.\n\u2018They opened the door for me\u2019\nPadilla in his Senate remarks gave an account of the events that led to him being handcuffed and detained last week.\nOn June 12, he had a meeting scheduled with General Gregory M. Guillot, commander of the U.S. Northern Command, to discuss the military presence in LA.\nPadilla, the top Democrat on a Judiciary panel that oversees DHS and immigration policy, said his meeting with the general was delayed because of a press briefing across the hall with Noem.\nPadilla said he has tried to speak with DHS because for weeks LA has \u201cseen a disturbing pattern of increasingly extreme and cruel immigration enforcement operations targeting non-violent people at places of worship, at schools, in courthouses.\u201d\nSo Padilla said he asked to attend the press conference, and a National Guard member and an FBI agent escorted him inside.\n\u201cThey opened the door for me,\u201d he said.\nAs he listened, he said a comment from Noem compelled him to ask a question.\n\u201cWe are not going away,\u201d Noem, the former governor of South Dakota, told the press. \u201cWe are staying here to liberate the city from the socialists and the burdensome leadership that this governor and that this mayor have placed on this country and what they have tried to insert into the city.\u201d\nPadilla said her remarks struck him as \u201can un-American mission statement.\u201d\n\u201cThat cannot be the mission of federal law enforcement and the United States military,\u201d he said. \u201cAre we truly prepared to live in a country where the president can deploy the armed forces to decide which duly elected governors and mayors should be allowed to lead their constituents?\u201d\nPadilla said before he could finish his question, he was physically removed and the National Guard member and FBI agent who escorted him in the room \u201cstood by silently, knowing full well who I was.\u201d\nAs he recounted being handcuffed, Padilla paused, getting emotional.\n\u201cI was forced to the ground, first on my knees, and then flat on my chest,\u201d he said.\nPadilla said a flurry of questions went through his head as he was marched down a hallway, and as he kept asking why he was being detained: Where are they taking me? What will a city, already on the edge from being militarized, think when they see their U.S. senator being handcuffed just for trying to ask a question? What will my wife think? What will our boys think?\n\u201cI also remember asking myself, if this aggressive escalation is the result of someone speaking up about the abuse and overreach of the Trump administration, was it really worth it?\u201d Padilla asked. \u201cIf a United States senator becomes too afraid to speak up, how can we expect any other American to do the same?\u201d\nPadilla-Noem meeting\nIn a statement, DHS, said that the Secret Service did not know Padilla was a U.S. senator, although video of the incident shows that Padilla stated that he was a member of the Senate.\n\u201cI\u2019m Sen. Alex Padilla and I have questions for the secretary,\u201d he said as four federal law enforcement officers grabbed him and shoved him to the ground.\nNoem met with Padilla after he was handcuffed, his office told States Newsroom.\n\u201cHe raised concerns with the deployment of military forces and the needless escalation over the last week, among other issues,\u201d according to his office. \u201cAnd he voiced his frustration with the continued lack of response from this administration. It was a civil, brief meeting, but the Secretary did not provide any meaningful answers. The Senator was simply trying to do his job and seek answers for the people he represents in California.\u201d\nU.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson has suggested that the Senate take action against Padilla, such as a censure. Johnson criticized the senator\u2019s actions and accused him of charging at Noem, which Padilla is not seen doing in the multiple videos of the incident.\n\u201cI\u2019m not in that chamber, but I do think that it merits immediate attention by other colleagues over there,\u201d the Louisiana Republican said. \u201cI think that behavior, at a minimum, rises to the level of censure. I think there needs to be a message sent by the body as a whole.\u201d\nSenate Democrats have coalesced their support around Padilla. During a Tuesday press conference, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer praised Padilla for his speech on the Senate floor.\n\u201cIt was basically a strong plea for America to regain the gyroscope of democracy, which has led us forward for so many years and now we\u2019re losing it,\u201d the New York Democrat said. \u201cIt\u2019s a wake-up call to all Americans.\u201d\nJennifer Shutt contributed to this report.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

Alex Padilla, D-Calif., was forcibly removed from a news conference in Los Angeles on Thursday after trying to question Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem during a press conference related to immigration.\n\"I am Sen. Alex Padilla. I have questions for the secretary,\" Padilla said to Noem, which prompted several men to physically push him out of the room. It was unclear who the men were, as several were dressed in plain clothes.\nPadilla's office shared a video of the incident with NBC News. The video shows Padilla being taken into a hallway outside and pushed face forward onto the ground as officers with FBI-identifying vests told the senator to put his hands behind his back. The officers then handcuffed him.\nPresident Donald Trump's immigration policies \u2014 and the administration's handling of demonstrations against those policies \u2014 have sparked an outcry in recent days. After protesters clashed with officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Los Angeles on Friday, the president deployed members of the National Guard, and later Marines, to assist local law enforcement. Dozens of demonstrations have taken place across the country in the days that followed.\nSpeaking to reporters later Thursday, Padilla said he was receiving a briefing from military officials when he learned Noem was in the same building and decided to join her briefing.\n\"I was there peacefully,\" he said. \"At one point, I had a question, and so I began to ask a question. I was almost immediately forcibly removed from the room, I was forced to the ground, and I was handcuffed.\"\nHe added, \"If this is how this administration responds to a senator with a question, if this is how the Department of Homeland Security responds to a senator with a question, you can only imagine what they\u2019re doing to farmworkers, to cooks, to day laborers out in the Los Angeles community and throughout California and throughout the country.\u201d\nDHS responded on X, falsely claiming that Padilla \"interrupted a live press conference without identifying himself.\" Noem made the same false allegation during an interview on Fox News.\n\"Mr. Padilla was told repeatedly to back away and did not comply with officers\u2019 repeated commands,\" DHS said, claiming that agents \"thought he was an attacker and officers acted appropriately. Secretary Noem met with Senator Padilla after and held a 15 minute meeting.\"\nBefore Padilla began questioning Noem, she spoke to reporters about the administration's actions, the subject of her appearance in Los Angeles. Noem said that DHS and its agencies, as well as the military, \"will continue to sustain and increase our operations in this city,\" she said.\n\"We are not going away,\" she said. \"We are staying here to liberate this city from the socialist and the burdensome leadership that this governor and that this mayor have placed on this country,\" she said, referring to California Gov. Gavin Newsom and L.A. Mayor Karen Bass, both Democrats.\nAs Padilla tried to question her, Noem spoke over the senator, \"I want to say thank you to every single person,\" and he was removed from the room.\nThe incident provoked further outrage from Democrats.\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., denounced the incident on the Senate floor. \"I just saw something that sickened my stomach \u2014 the manhandling of a United States senator. We need immediate answers to what the hell went on,\" he said.\nSen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the state's other senator, wrote on X that Padilla \"represents the best of the Senate. The disgraceful and disrespectful conduct of DHS agents, pushing and shoving him out of a briefing like that, demands our condemnation. He will not be silenced or intimidated. His questions will be answered. I\u2019m with Alex.\"\nNewsom said in a post on X that Padilla \"is one of the most decent people I know.\" \"This is outrageous, dictatorial, and shameful. Trump and his shock troops are out of control. This must end now,\" he added.\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris called the incident \"a shameful and stunning abuse of power.\"\nRepublicans, meanwhile, criticized Padilla over the episode.\n\"Padilla didn\u2019t want answers; he wanted attention,\" White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said. \"Padilla embarrassed himself and his constituents with this immature, theater-kid stunt.\"\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said that what his Democratic colleague \"ought to be doing, in my view, is making sure that we have rational immigration policy. And Sen. Padilla, who\u2019s a nice man, sat on the sidelines for four years, watch the border completely be blown apart.\u201d\nThe incident follows a string of arrests of Democratic elected officials related to immigration. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested last month for allegedly trespassing at an ICE facility in New Jersey. The charges were ultimately dropped, but he has sued interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba over the incident and Ricky J. Patel, a special agent in charge of the Newark division of Homeland Security Investigations.\nEarlier this week, Rep. LaMonica McIver, D-N.J., was indicted on federal charges that stemmed from the same confrontation with law enforcement.\nTrump's \"border czar\" Tom Homan also suggested that Newsom and Bass could be arrested, too, if they interfere with federal agents."]}, {"topic": 13, "name": "Trump Administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on Climate Policy", "keywords": "climate, epa, power, emissions, plants, carbon, greenhouse, pollution, gas, environmental", "documents": ["Trump's EPA delivers new blow to Biden climate agenda. Trump\u2019s EPA delivers new blow to Biden climate agenda\nEPA argues that the second-largest source of U.S. greenhouse gas pollution contributes too little to the world\u2019s climate problem to be worth regulating.\nThe Trump administration announced Wednesday that it\u2019s revoking limits on power plants\u2019 climate pollution \u2014 removing the cornerstone of a decadelong strategy to douse one of the nation\u2019s largest sources of heat-trapping gases.\nThe proposal by the Environmental Protection Agency would free thousands of existing and future facilities that burn coal or natural gas from regulations aimed at lowering their output of carbon dioxide pollution. It comes as President Donald Trump has shuttered climate change offices across the government, fired scientists and frozen billions of dollars in funding for renewable energy projects.\nEPA\u2019s plan to unshackle the power sector \u2014 the second-largest source of U.S. climate pollution, behind transportation \u2014 collides with the agency\u2019s past assertions that the most effective way to slow rising temperatures is by tackling the biggest contributors of greenhouse gases.\nAdministrator Lee Zeldin has reversed that argument. His proposed repeal of President Joe Biden\u2019s 2024 power plant climate rule asserts that the electricity-generating facilities contribute too little climate pollution globally to warrant being regulated. That\u2019s even though the United States is the world\u2019s second-largest climate polluter, ranking only behind China. The U.S. power sector releases more carbon emissions than all but five countries.\nEPA\u2019s new rule said that greenhouse gas emissions from U.S. fossil fuel power plants are not significant because they \u201care a small and decreasing part of global emissions; cost-effective control measures are not reasonably available; and because this Administration\u2019s priority is to promote the public health or welfare through energy dominance and independence secured by using fossil fuels to generate power.\u201d\nPower plants are responsible for almost a quarter of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, or about 2.7 percent of all global climate pollution, according to EPA. The agency argued in its proposed rollback that the facilities\u2019 don\u2019t contribute \u201csignificantly\u201d to global warming, using language from a legal threshold for regulation in the Clean Air Act.\nThe assertion promises to ignite court challenges from green groups and Democratic-led states.\n\u201cThe collision between Republican political imperatives driven by the fossil fuel industry and fact and reality is particularly apparent in this because power plant emissions in the United States are a very significant part of global emissions,\u201d said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.). \u201cSo it\u2019s just plain false to pretend this isn\u2019t a big deal.\u201d\nIf the courts uphold the EPA rule, which the administration expects to finalize this year, it could free the government from legal requirements to regulate climate emissions from other stationary sources such as refineries and industrial facilities.\nThe administration also announced it will roll back (Reg. 2060-AW68) a separate Biden-era rule aimed at reducing power plants\u2019 releases of toxic mercury into the air (Reg. 2060-AV53), strengthening the original Obama-era standards.\nEPA\u2019s plan also targets a 2015 rule requiring new coal plants to capture a share of their carbon emissions. The Obama-era standard remained on the books throughout the first Trump administration \u2014 largely because no new coal-fired power plants were planned.\nThe rollback comes as EPA targets the scientific underpinning for its authority to limit climate pollution \u2014 not just from power plants, but also the transportation sector, the largest U.S. source of warming gases. Called the endangerment finding, the landmark 2009 conclusion found that greenhouse gases pose a threat to human health.\nEPA is expected to announce later this year whether it plans to repeal that finding, a step that could allow the Trump administration to stop regulating climate pollution from cars and trucks. Together, those vehicles are responsible for about 30 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions or around 3.4 percent globally.\nTo regulate greenhouse gases from power plants, the Clean Air Act requires EPA to determine that such pollution \u201ccauses, or contributes significantly to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.\u201d\nIn the final days of Trump\u2019s first term in January 2021, EPA issued a surprise rule defining the significance threshold at 3 percent of U.S. emissions. Such a level would have maintained regulation over power plants but exempted every other industry, including oil and gas production, oil refining and industrial boilers used in a variety of manufacturing sectors.\nThe rule was later vacated in court because the Trump administration had issued it as a final rule without going through the required public rulemaking process.\nThis time, EPA is going even further by effectively saying that no industry in the U.S. contributes \u201csignificantly\u201d to climate change, and thus the agency has no authority to regulate (Reg. 2060-AW55).\nYet the U.S. has contributed one-fifth of the pollution that has driven climate change to date and remains the world\u2019s second-largest source of planet-heating gases.\nThat means greenhouse gases from any U.S. sector intensify warming, said Noah Diffenbaugh, a climate science professor at Stanford University. The science shows that each increment of warming from those emissions causes a \u201cmultiple, exponential effect\u201d in terms of the impacts to the planet, he said.\nThat brings severe economic costs. Diffenbaugh\u2019s research group found that over a nearly 30-year period, heavier precipitation linked to climate change resulted in 36 percent of U.S. financial losses from flooding, while hotter temperatures caused about 20 percent of insured crop losses. Damages amounted to tens of billions of dollars.\n\u201cWe can absolutely expect the stresses that we experience from the climate system to accelerate,\u201d he said. \u201cHow much of that we experience really does depend on how much humans emit going forward in the future.\u201d\nThe agency is also proposing to repeal the Biden administration\u2019s power plant climate rule (Reg. 2060-AV09). That regulation effectively required coal-fired power plants planning to operate long-term to install technology to capture most of their carbon emissions \u2014 something no coal plant in the U.S. has ever done on that scale. It also required some new gas-fired power plants to eventually install carbon capture systems.\nIndustry groups have argued that using carbon capture systems as the rule\u2019s benchmark technology was impractical and possibly illegal.\nDuring oral arguments over the rule in December, several federal appellate judges questioned whether carbon capture technology was ready for the kind of wide-scale deployment EPA\u2019s rule would require \u2014 even if the agency expected most power plants would choose to shut down rather than invest significant sums in pollution controls. The court never decided whether Biden\u2019s rule was lawful.\nThe 2024 rule would also have required coal plants that commit to closing by 2039 to reduce emissions by co-firing with gas \u2014 a requirement the Trump administration proposed to strike down because it says it violates a Supreme Court prohibition on fuel shifting.\nThe Biden rule was EPA\u2019s third effort to regulate greenhouse gases from power plants.\nIn 2015, the Obama administration issued the Clean Power Plan, which relied heavily on utilities shifting away from coal and toward natural gas and renewables to reduce climate pollution across the electricity sector. The Supreme Court later ruled that the plan overstepped the agency\u2019s authority, which the justices said is limited to addressing pollution from specific sources as opposed to entire industries.\nDuring Trump\u2019s first term, EPA issued a rule requiring only minor efficiency upgrades to coal plants. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals struck that down because EPA had refused to consider other methods of emissions reductions.\nDespite EPA spinning its wheels on tackling power plant climate pollution for more than a decade, the sector has reduced its emissions anyway \u2014 by about 41 percent from its peak in 2007, according to EPA data.\nThe decrease was caused by a long-term shift away from coal as market forces and the risk of EPA eventually imposing climate rules pushed the sector to use more natural gas and renewable energy.\nZack Colman, Annie Snider and Josh Siegel contributed to this report.", "\u2018We've lost the culture war on climate\u2019. \u2018We\u2019ve lost the culture war on climate\u2019\nThe U.S. government has long recognized greenhouse gases as a threat, but major rules to address them have failed to stick.\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s latest climate rollback makes it all but official: The United States is giving up on trying to stop the planet\u2019s warming.\nIn some ways, the effort has barely started.\nMore than 15 years after federal regulators officially recognized that greenhouse gas pollution threatens \u201ccurrent and future generations,\u201d their most ambitious efforts to defuse that threat have been blocked in the courts and by Trump\u2019s rule-slicing buzzsaw. Wednesday\u2019s action by the Environmental Protection Agency would extend that streak by wiping out a Biden-era regulation on power plants \u2014 leaving the nation\u2019s second-largest source of climate pollution unshackled until at least the early 2030s. Rules aimed at lessening climate pollution from transportation, the nation\u2019s No. 1 source, are also on the Trump hit list.\nMeanwhile, the GOP megabill lumbering through the Senate would dismember former President Joe Biden\u2019s other huge climate initiative, the 2022 law that sought to use hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks and other incentives to encourage consumers and businesses to switch to carbon-free energy. At the same time, Trump\u2019s appointees have spent months shutting down climate programs, firing their workers and gutting research into the problem, while making it harder for states such as California to tackle the issue on their own.\nThe years of whipsawing moves have left Washington with no consistent approach on how \u2014 or whether \u2014 to confront climate change, even as scientists warn that years are growing short to avoid catastrophic damage to human society. While the Trump-era GOP\u2019s hardening opposition to climate action has been a major reason for the lack of consensus, one former Democratic adviser said her own party needs to find a message that resonates with broad swaths of the electorate.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way around it: The left strategy on climate needs to be rethought,\u201d said Jody Freeman, who served as counselor for energy and climate change in President Barack Obama\u2019s White House. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost the culture war on climate, and we have to figure out a way for it to not be a niche leftist movement.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a strategy Freeman admitted she was \u201cstruggling\u201d to articulate, but one that included using natural gas as a \u201cbridge fuel\u201d to more renewable power \u2014 an approach Democrats embraced during the Obama administration \u2014 finding \u201ca new approach\u201d for easing permits for energy infrastructure and building broad-based political support.\nAs the Democratic nominee in 2008, Obama expressed the hope that his campaign would be seen as \u201cthe moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal.\u201d But two years later, the Democrats\u2019 cap-and-trade climate bill failed to get through a Senate where they held a supermajority. Obama didn\u2019t return to the issue in earnest until his second term, taking actions including the enactment of a sweeping power plant rule that wasn\u2019t yet in effect when Trump rescinded it and the Supreme Court declared it dead.\nRepublicans, meanwhile, have moved far from their seemingly moderating stance in 2008, when nominee John McCain offered his own climate proposals and even then-President George W. Bush announced a modest target for slowing carbon pollution by 2025.\nEPA Administrator Lee Zeldin contended Wednesday that the Obama- and Biden-era rules were overbearing and too costly.\n\u201cThe American public spoke loudly and clearly last November: They wanted to make sure that all agencies were cognizant of their economic concerns,\u201d he said when announcing the rule rollback at agency headquarters. \u201cAt the EPA under President Trump, we have chosen to both protect the environment and grow the economy.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s new strategy of ditching greenhouse gas limits altogether is legally questionable, experts involved in crafting the Obama and Biden power plant rules told POLITICO. But they acknowledged that the Trump administration at the very least will significantly weaken rules on power plants\u2019 climate pollution, at a moment when the trends are going in the wrong direction.\nGina McCarthy, who led EPA during the Obama administration, said in a statement that Zeldin\u2019s rationale is \u201cabsolutely illogical and indefensible. It\u2019s a purely political play that goes against decades of science and policy review.\u201d\nU.S. greenhouse gas emissions were virtually flat last year, falling just 0.2 percent, after declining 20 percent since 2005, according to the research firm Rhodium Group. That output would need to fall 7.6 percent annually through 2030 to meet the climate goals Biden floated, which were aimed at limiting the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius since the start of the Industrial Revolution. That level is a critical threshold for avoiding the most severe impacts of climate change.\nThose targets now look out of reach. The World Meteorological Organization last month gave 70 percent odds that the five-year global temperature average through 2029 would register above 1.5 degrees.\nThe Obama-era rule came out during a decade when governments around the world threw their weight behind blunting climate pollution through executive actions. Ricky Revesz, who was Biden\u2019s regulatory czar, recalled the \u201cgreat excitement\u201d at the White House Blue Room reception just before Obama announced his power plant rule, known as the Clean Power Plan. It seemed a watershed moment. But it didn\u2019t last.\n\u201cI thought that it was going to be a more linear path forward,\u201d he said. \u201cThat linear path forward has not materialized. And that is disappointing.\u201d\nOpponents who have long argued that such regulations would wreck the economy while doing little to curb global temperature increases have traveled the same road in reverse. Republican West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey said he felt dread when Obama announced the Clean Power Plan in 2015. Then the state\u2019s attorney general, he feared the rule\u2019s focus on curbing carbon dioxide from power plants would have a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d impact on West Virginia\u2019s coal-reliant economy.\n\u201cIt was really an audacious and outrageous attempt to regulate the economy when they had no power to do so,\u201d said Morrisey, who led a coalition of states that sued the EPA over Obama\u2019s proposal. \u201cYou can\u2019t take the actions that they were trying to take without going to the legislature.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Congress has become harsher terrain for climate action.\nIn May, House Republicans voted to undo the incentives for electric cars and other clean energy technologies in Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act, the nation\u2019s most significant effort to spur clean energy and curb climate change.\nThat same week, 35 House Democrats and Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) crossed the aisle and voted to kill an EPA waiver that had allowed California to set more stringent tailpipe pollution standards for vehicles to deal with its historically smoggy skies. California was planning to use that waiver to end sales of internal combustion engine vehicles in 2035, a rule 10 other states and the District of Columbia had planned to follow.\nThe Supreme Court has added to the obstacles for climate policy \u2014 introducing more existential challenges for efforts to use executive powers to corral greenhouse gas emissions. In its 2022 decision striking down the Obama administration\u2019s power plant rule, the court said agencies such as EPA need Congress\u2019 explicit approval before enacting regulations that would have a \u201cmajor\u201d impact on the economy. (It didn\u2019t precisely define what counts as \u201cmajor.\u201d) In 2024, the court eviscerated a decades-old precedent known as the Chevron doctrine, which had afforded agencies broad leeway in how they interpret vague statutes.\nMany climate advocates and former Democratic officials contend that all those obstacles are bumps, not barriers, on the tortuous path to reducing greenhouse gases. They say that even the regulatory fits and starts have provided signals to markets and businesses about where federal policy is heading in the long term \u2014 prodding the private sector to make investments to green the nation\u2019s energy system.\nOne symptom is a sharp decline in U.S. reliance on coal \u2014 by far the most climate-polluting power source, and the one that would face the stiffest restrictions in any successful federal regulation to lessen the electricity industry\u2019s emissions. Coal supplied 48.5 percent of the nation\u2019s power generation in 2007, but that fell to 15 percent in 2024. Last year, solar and wind power combined to overtake coal for the first time.\n\u201cRegulation has served the purpose of moving things along faster,\u201d said Janet McCabe, who was deputy EPA administrator under Biden and ran EPA\u2019s Office of Air and Radiation during Obama\u2019s second term. \u201cThe trajectory is always in the right direction.\u201d\nFreeman, who is now at Harvard Law School, said federal regulations plus state laws requiring renewable power to comprise portions of the electricity mix helped justify utility investments in clean energy. That, in turn, accelerated price drops for wind and solar power, she said.\nClean energy advocates point to those broader market shifts, calling a cleaner power grid inevitable.\n\u201cThere are people in each of these industries who wouldn\u2019t have taken the climate problem seriously and cleaner technology seriously, and invested in it, if it weren\u2019t for the pressure of the Clean Air Act and the incentives that more recently had been built into the IRA,\u201d said David Doniger, senior attorney and strategist at the Natural Resources Defense Council. \u201cSo policy does matter, even when it\u2019s not in a straight line and the implementation is inadequate.\u201d\nBut even if those economic trends continue \u2014 an open question given the enormous new power demand from data centers \u2014 it will not bring the U.S. closer to cuts needed to keep the world from overheating, multiple climate studies have concluded. And the greatest chunk of the emissions decline since 2005 comes from shifting coal to natural gas, another fossil fuel, which fracking made cheap and abundant.\nBiden\u2019s power plant rule, now being shelved by Trump\u2019s EPA, would have imposed limits on both coal-burning power plants and future gas-fired ones, requiring them to either capture their greenhouse gases or shut down.\nStaving off regulations may well keep coal-fired power plants running longer than anticipated to meet forecast demand growth, belching more carbon dioxide into the air. The Trump administration has even sought to temporarily exempt power plants from air pollution rules altogether and is trying to use emergency powers to prevent coal generators from shuttering.\nWithout federal rules that say otherwise, power providers would also be likely to add more natural gas generation to the grid.\nFailing to curb power plants\u2019 pollution, scientists say, means temperatures will continue to rise and bring more of the floods, heat waves, wildfires, supply chain disruptions, food shortages and other shocks that cost the U.S. hundreds of billions of dollars each year in property damage, illness, death and lost productivity.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the economics are going to take care of it by any means,\u201d said Joe Goffman, who led the Biden EPA air office. \u201cThe effects of climate change are going to continue to be felt and they\u2019re going to continue to be costly in terms of dollars and cents and in terms of human experience.\u201d\nSome state governors, such as Democrats Kathy Hochul of New York and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, have vowed to go it alone on climate policy if need be.\nBut analyses have shown state actions alone are unlikely to achieve the greenhouse gas reductions at the scale and speed needed to avoid baking in catastrophic effects from climate change.\nThe Sierra Club, for example, has helped shutter nearly 400 coal-fired units across the U.S. since 2010 through its Beyond Coal campaign, which has argued the economic case against fossil fuel generation in front of state utility commissions. While Joanne Spalding, the group\u2019s legal director, said it can continue to strike blows against coal with that strategy, she acknowledged that \u201cgas is a huge problem\u201d \u2014 and left no doubt that the Trump administration\u2019s moves would do damage.\n\u201cGiven what the science says about the need to act urgently, this will be a lost four years in the United States,\u201d she said.", "Trump's EPA wants to repeal regulations on carbon emissions from power plants. The Environmental Protection Agency announced Wednesday that it will aim to eliminate existing limits on greenhouse gas emissions from coal- and gas-fired power plants, a move that would curb the agency\u2019s ability to combat climate change under the Clean Air Act.\nEPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a news conference that Biden-era carbon pollution standards for power plants \u201csuffocate\u201d the economy in order to protect the environment. Zeldin, who was appointed by President Donald Trump in January, stated that the agency\u2019s announcement was a huge step forward in energy dominance for the U.S., while promising that no power plants would emit more than they already do. Currently, the power sector accounts for a quarter of all U.S. emissions, according to the latest EPA emissions data.\nZeldin also said the EPA plans to weaken Biden-era regulations on mercury emissions from power plants.\nEnvironmental advocates say the EPA\u2019s proposal is an escalation in the Trump administration\u2019s ongoing push against climate action across federal agencies, including at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Department of Energy and the National Weather Service. In 2024, the Biden administration finalized the most stringent carbon pollution standards for power plants to date in an effort to tackle the climate crisis \u2014 but now, those rules face an uncertain future.\nGina McCarthy, a former EPA Administrator under President Joe Biden, called Zeldin\u2019s announcement a \u201cpolitical play\u201d that defies \u201cdecades of science and policy review\u201d in a statement on Wednesday.\n\u201cBy giving a green light to more pollution, his legacy will forever be someone who does the bidding of the fossil fuel industry at the expense of our health,\u201d McCarthy said.\nJill Tauber, the vice president of litigation for climate and energy at Earthjustice, a nonprofit currently suing the Trump administration over several environmental rollbacks said: \u201cEliminating pollution standards from the largest industrial source of greenhouse gas pollution in the United States flies in the face of what the law requires, what the science tells us, and what we\u2019re seeing every day.\u201d\nPower plants in the U.S. are a huge contributor to global carbon emissions. A report published by the Institute for Policy Integrity at the New York University School of Law found that if the U.S. power sector were its own country, it would be the sixth-largest emitter in the world.\nUnder the first Trump administration, the EPA rolled back several Obama-era greenhouse gas standards on power plants, but this recent announcement marks the first time the agency has suggested outright repeals. Zeldin\u2019s move on power plants follows his promise in March to tackle the \u201cclimate change religion\u201d by reconsidering or repealing 31 regulations surrounding tailpipe emissions, coal ash regulations and oil and gas wastewater management.\nThe proposed rule, which will now move into its comment period, will face scrutiny from legal advocates and environmental nonprofits like Earthjustice and the Natural Resources Defense Council, which say the EPA is obligated to regulate greenhouse gas emissions by law \u2014 citing seminal cases like the 2007 Massachusetts v. EPA lawsuit, which determined that greenhouse gases must be regulated by the EPA under the Clean Air Act.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be watching closely to see if the EPA proceeds with repealing these life-saving standards based on a legal theory that doesn\u2019t pass the laugh test,\u201d said Meredith Hawkins, the federal climate legal director at the Natural Resources Defense Council. \u201cThe NRDC stands ready to defend the public\u2019s right to breathe in court if needed.\u201d\nCutting historic limits on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants would impact global climate change, but it could also cause ripple effects on human health and the economy.\nHarvey Reiter, an energy and utilities lawyer and a law professor at George Washington University, says that if the EPA moves forward with its planned repeals, he expects some energy companies and utilities that have retooled operations and made long-term investments in renewable energy to sue the Trump administration.\n\u201cThe biggest impacts of the proposed rules are uncertainty and instability,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody knows what to do next. It makes investment decisions harder. It makes decisions about hiring, staff and employees harder. It creates a lot of uncertainty in the market.\u201d\nGreenhouse gas emissions from power plants are not just a climate issue. Burning fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide as well as other air pollutants, including nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, mercury and fine particulate matter, which are linked to increased risk of respiratory issues and cardiovascular disease. Regulating carbon emissions from power plants broadly reduces other air pollution for communities living near power plants, said Laura Kate Bender, the vice president of nationwide advocacy and public policy at the American Lung Association.\n\u201cIt works both ways. On the one hand, power plants burning fossil fuels contribute to climate change and cause health problems at the same time,\u201d said Bender. \u201cAnd then climate change, in many cases, contributes to extreme heat, or more wildfire smoke, or more ozone smogs. Climate change is a health emergency, and cutting carbon in the power sector is a critical tool in the toolbox for fighting climate change.\u201d"]}, {"topic": 14, "name": "Ban on Transgender Medical Care", "keywords": "transgender, court, sex, gender, supreme, marriage, passport, minors, genderaffirming, that", "documents": ["Supreme Court delivers major blow to transgender rights, upholding Tennessee ban on gender-affirming care for minors.

WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld a Tennessee law restricting gender transition care for minors, delivering a major blow to transgender rights.\nThe 6-3 ruling is likely to have a broad impact as 24 other states have already enacted laws similar to the one in Tennessee, which bars gender transition surgery, puberty blockers and hormone therapy for youth.\nThose laws now look set to survive similar legal challenges. The ruling does not affect states that do not have such bans, meaning care in those states will still be available.\nThe court was divided on ideological lines, with the six conservatives in the majority and the three liberals in dissent.\nWriting for the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts concluded that the Tennessee law does not constitute a form of sex discrimination that would violate the Constitution's 14th Amendment.\n\"This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field,\" Roberts wrote. \"The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound.\"\n\"The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements,\" he added.\nLiberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a dissenting opinion that contrary to the majority's conclusion, the law does discriminate based on both sex and transgender status and should therefore be analyzed closely.\n\"By retreating from meaningful judicial review exactly where it matters most, the court abandons transgender children and their families to political whims,\" she wrote. \"In sadness, I dissent.\"\nSotomayor also took the relatively unusual step of reading a summary of her decision from the bench in court, saying the impact of the decision is \"incredibly dangerous.\"\nTrans rights activists have warned that a ruling allowing bans on care for trans minors could pave the way for similar restrictions aimed at adults.\n\"Today's ruling is a devastating loss for transgender people, our families, and everyone who cares about the Constitution,\" Chase Strangio, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union who represents the challengers, said in a statement.\nTennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti welcomed the decision as a win for \"common sense over judicial activism.\"\nHe added that legislators should give \"careful scrutiny\" before allowing such treatments, making judgments \"based on science, not ideology.\"\nThe legal challenge was brought by the administration of former President Joe Biden, as well as transgender teens and their families.\nThe ruling does not resolve all legal issues relating to the state bans, as it did not address a separate argument under the 14th Amendment that the laws violate the right of parents to make health care decisions for their children.\nThe court also did not rule on the question of whether laws that discriminate against transgender people are subject to what is called \"heightened scrutiny,\" meaning that judges should review them with a skeptical eye. But three of the conservative justices said transgender people are not a \"suspect class,\" meaning laws targeting them should not receive heightened scrutiny.\nOther issues involving transgender rights, such as laws blocking transgender girls from participating in sports, are likely to reach the court in due course.\nUpon taking office in January, President Donald Trump has set about unwinding Biden policies that sought to bolster transgender rights. Among other things, he signed an executive order seeking to restrict gender-affirming care for teenagers nationwide. A judge quickly blocked it.\nTrump has also imposed new restrictions on transgender people serving in the military.\n\"President Trump will continue to speak out and take action to protect innocent American children from these barbaric procedures that are based on junk science,\" White House spokeswoman Liz Huston said in a statement praising the ruling.\nEnacted in 2023, the Tennessee law is among a wave of similar measures taken by states imposing restrictions on gender transition treatments. In defending its ban, the state's lawyers pointed to similar measures taken in other countries, including in Europe.\nSkrmetti emphasized in court papers the evolving debate over how best to treat minors diagnosed with gender dysphoria, the clinical term given to the distress people can experience when their gender identities are in conflict with the genders assigned to them at birth.\nMajor medical organizations say gender-affirming treatments are an effective way to treat gender dysphoria.\n\"Let us be clear \u2014 healthcare bans of any kind are rooted in stigma, misinformation, and fear and this one comes at the expense of the youth in need of this care,\" the World Professional Association for Transgender Health and its United States affiliate, said in a statement.\nThe challengers argued that the law is a form of sex discrimination that violates the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause because the treatments at issue in the case \u2014 puberty blockers and hormone therapy \u2014 can be used in other situations.\nThe case marks the most significant ruling on transgender rights since the court in 2020, to the surprise of many, ruled that federal employment protections extend to gender identity, as well as sexual orientation.\nThe dispute reached the Supreme Court after the Cincinnati-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2023 rejected challenges to the Tennessee law and a similar measure in Kentucky.\nA district court judge had blocked parts of the law, while concluding that the plaintiffs did not have legal standing to challenge the surgery ban. That provision of the law was not at issue before the Supreme Court.", "Supreme Court delivers major blow to transgender rights, upholding Tennessee ban on gender-affirming care for minors.

Rural hospitals across the U.S. \u2014 many already hanging by a thread \u2014 could take a serious hit if a proposed Medicaid cut in the Senate\u2019s domestic spending bill is signed into law.\nThe provision, outlined in the 549-page bill released by the Senate Finance Committee on Monday, would gradually limit states\u2019 use of Medicaid\u2019s so-called provider tax.\nMedicaid is jointly funded by the federal government and states. States cover the upfront cost of care and then are reimbursed by the federal government for at least 50%.\nThe provider tax is a state-imposed fee on hospitals and other health care providers to help fund a state\u2019s share of the Medicaid program. When states use provider funds to boost their Medicaid spending, the federal government gives them more money because it's required to match it.\nThe tax must apply to all providers within a class \u2014 so if a state wants to tax hospitals, it must include all licensed hospitals. Most states have multiple provider taxes, including taxes for nursing facilities and ambulance services, said Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy who focuses primarily on Medicaid.\nAll states, except for Alaska, have at least one provider tax, Park said. A good chunk of the money raised goes toward supporting rural hospitals, which often serve a higher share of low-income and Medicaid patients.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a key financing source for rural hospitals, which tend to have much thinner operating margins,\u201d Park said. In recent years, he added, rural hospitals have \u201chad a rash of closures, staff cuts and service cuts\u201d due to financial hardship.\nA report from the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform, a think tank, found that one-third of all rural hospitals are at risk of closing.\nThe Senate proposal would gradually reduce the provider\u2019s tax rate of 6% or less to 3.5% by 2031, according to Monday\u2019s outline. States that haven\u2019t expanded Medicaid, such as Florida and Texas, would get to keep their rates at their current levels.\nTaxes on nursing homes and intermediate care facilities, which provide services for people with disabilities, are exempt from the new limit.\nDr. Adam Gaffney, a critical care physician and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, said the Senate\u2019s proposal is more aggressive than the House\u2019s version, which proposes freezing the provider tax rate at its current level and barring states from implementing new taxes.\nGaffney published a study on Monday that found the Medicaid cuts proposed in the House bill could cause an estimated 7.6 million Americans to lose health insurance, leading to thousands of preventable deaths.\nUnder the Senate\u2019s proposal, Gaffney said rural hospitals will likely be forced to reduce the services they offer, cut staff or close altogether. Many more patients would also likely die, he added, because they no longer have a hospital nearby.\nA report from the Pew Research Center found rural Americans live an average of 10.5 miles or 17 minutes from the nearest hospital \u2014 about twice as far and five to seven minutes longer than people in suburban and urban areas.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way around it. It\u2019s just basic math,\u201d Gaffney said. \u201cIt means more harm, and that more people will die from lack of care.\u201d\nGaffney said Republicans should be taking steps to keep hospitals in rural areas, where many of their voters live, open.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, hospitals that are in places where patients are poor tend to be poor and to be more at risk of closure,\u201d he said.\nKevin Stansbury, the CEO of the Lincoln Community Hospital, a 25-bed rural hospital in Hugo, Colorado, said his business is unlikely to survive under the proposed changes.\nStansbury said his hospital serves an area roughly the size of Connecticut but has only about two providers per square mile. About 25% of his patients are on Medicaid.\nThe hospital receives about $300,000 a month in provider tax reimbursements, which he said are \u201cessential for us to keep our doors open\u201d and is still only enough to break even.\nWithout the 6% provider tax rate, he will likely have to start cutting services for patients, including long-term care, he said.\n\u201cIf I start crying, forgive me,\u201d Stansbury said. \u201cIt just breaks my heart.\u201d\nThe proposed cuts in the Senate bill are not final and may not end up in the version that reaches President Donald Trump\u2019s desk.\nIf the Senate\u2019s provider tax changes do make it through to the final bill, they are likely to be deeply unpopular among the public, said Robin Rudowitz, director of the program on Medicaid and the uninsured at KFF, a nonprofit group that focuses on health policy.\nPolling shows that about 3 in 4 rural residents say funding for Medicaid should increase or stay the same, Rudowitz said. About three-quarters of people living in rural areas, she added, say that Medicaid is very important to people in their communities.\n\u201cChanges that would restrict or retrench coverage gains could have negative implications for these hospitals,\u201d she said.\nRural hospitals groups are already pushing back on the proposed limits on the provider tax.\nIn an emailed statement, Bruce Siegel, the president and CEO of America\u2019s Essential Hospitals, a nonprofit group that advocates for hospitals serving poor communities, said the Senate\u2019s changes \u201cwould devastate health care access for millions of Americans and hollow out the vital role essential hospitals play in their communities.\u201d\nIn a release Tuesday, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, slammed the proposed cuts.\n\u201cSenate Republicans would pay for those new corporate tax breaks by making even deeper cuts to Medicaid, slashing funding for rural hospitals and other essential health care providers and throwing cash-strapped states off a funding cliff,\u201d Wyden said.", "Trump\u2019s \u201cBig, Beautiful Bill\u201d Will Lead to 51,000 Preventable Deaths Each Year. In a letter sent to Senate leaders on June 3, a team of health experts at Yale University and the University of Pennsylvania warn that funding cuts included in the budget reconciliation package narrowly passed by House Republicans last month would lead to 51,000 more people dying across the United States each year.\nThe package, labeled the \u201cbig beautiful bill\u201d by President Donald Trump, includes deep cuts to Medicaid, which provides health insurance for lower-income and disabled people. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that a total of 10.9 million people will lose health insurance by 2034 if the current bill becomes law and Congress allows cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act Marketplace to go through. An additional 5.1 million people would lose coverage because the bill fails to extend tax credits for ACA Marketplace plans, and Health and Human Services has proposed new rules limiting the program\u2019s enrollment periods and making other changes, bringing the total to 16 million.\nThe estimate of 51,000 preventable deaths is based on details from a previous analysis from CBO, which initially found that 13.7 million people would lose their health care coverage by 2034. Since CBO has now revised that estimate to be higher in response to queries from Democrats, the estimate of 51,000 deaths could, in fact, be an undercount.\nThe legislation would also repeal federal safe staffing standards that require nursing homes and long-term care facilities to maintain a minimum ratio of nurses to patients in order to provide proper care, which the researchers estimate would result in 13,000 additional deaths annually.\nThe Senate is taking up the \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d after House Republicans passed the budget package on a razor thin, one-vote margin, despite protests from Democrats and a handful of moderate Republicans from swing districts. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) requested the analysis on mortality as ranking members on the Senate Budget Committee and the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, respectively.\n\u201cIn other words, when you throw 13.7 million Americans off the health care they have \u2026 when you increase the cost of prescription drugs for low-income seniors, and when you make nursing homes throughout America less safe, not only will some of the most vulnerable people throughout our country suffer, but tens of thousands will die,\u201d Sanders said in a statement on Tuesday.\nThe latest calculations from public health experts adds to a growing pile of research on the devastating potential impacts of budget cuts, which Trump and his fellow Republicans are pushing for to cover tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy. If the current bill becomes law, annual cuts to Medicaid would average over $70 billion over the coming years \u2014 the same amount millionaires and billionaires would gain in tax cuts each year, according to the Economic Policy Institute (EPI).\nEven with those cuts to critical health care programs, the budget package is projected to increase the national debt by $3.1 trillion over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. In an open letter to the Senate on Monday, EPI and six Nobel laureate economists said the nation\u2019s structural deficits are already too high, and the bill would put upward pressure on inflation and interest rates while reducing incomes for the bottom 40 percent of earners. Taken together, the economists wrote, \u201cthe House budget constitutes an extremely large upward redistribution of income\u201d while adding to the national debt.\n\u201cThese steep cuts to the social safety net are being undertaken to defray the staggering cost of the tax cuts included in the House bill, including the hidden cost of preserving the large corporate income tax cut passed in the 2017 tax law,\u201d the economists wrote. \u201cBut even these sharp spending cuts will pay for far less than half of the tax cuts (not even including the cost of maintaining the corporate income tax cuts of the 2017 law).\u201d\nThe budget reconciliation package makes cuts to health care funding in multiple ways, although the proposal to impose work requirements on adult Medicaid enrollees has received the most media attention. The researchers at Yale and the University of Pennsylvania focused on three policies impacting three distinct groups: individuals who will lose all Medicaid coverage, lower-income seniors who will lose subsidies that help pay for prescription drugs, and people who are expected to die in nursing homes if the safe staffing requirements are removed.\nAccording to their data, the researchers estimated an additional 51,000 preventable deaths annually, including:\n- 11,300 deaths from the loss of Medicaid or Affordable Care Act Marketplace coverage, given that CBO first estimated 7.7 million people will lose coverage. That number has since been updated to 10.9 million.\n- 18,200 deaths due to the loss of Medicaid coverage among 1.38 million low-income Medicare beneficiaries, causing loss of access to low-income prescription drug subsidies.\n- 13,000 deaths among Medicaid enrollees in nursing homes due to the rollback of 2024 nursing home minimum staffing rule.\nIn addition, the bill does not extend 2021\u2019s enhanced premium tax credits for ACA Marketplace insurance plans. If lawmakers allow these tax credits to expire and the rule changes at the Department of Health and Human Services become effective, an estimated 5.1 million people will lose affordable health insurance, leading to an additional estimated 8,811 preventable deaths, bringing the total to at least 51,000.\n\u201cWe know that when people are enrolled in Medicaid it saves lives compared to people not having health coverage, and we know the bill will increase churn and disenrollment in Medicaid,\u201d said Rachel Werner, director of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics and co-author of the analysis, in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s estimated that millions will lose coverage, and that will translate to loss of life.\u201d\nPolling consistently shows that cuts to Medicaid and the health care safety net are deeply unpopular, and many rural and lower-income districts in red states depend on Medicaid to keep hospitals and clinics running. Perhaps this explains why Trump has made a show of publicly urging House Republicans not to \u201ctouch\u201d Medicaid. Now that Medicaid is indeed on the chopping block, Trump and his allies in Congress are turning to lies and misinformation.\nIn a statement on Monday, the White House said the idea that \u201cpeople will literally die\u201d due to Medicaid cuts is a \u201choax\u201d and a \u201cdisgusting lie\u201d told by Democrats. The bill would penalize states that used their own funds to expand Medicaid to cover some immigrants who would not qualify for federal funding; the White House claimed Medicaid would be \u201cstrengthened\u201d by removing 1.4 million undocumented immigrants from the rolls. That coverage loss would also extend to documented children and pregnant women under the proposed policy, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), a top health policy think tank.\nTrump and his allies in Congress are also defending controversial Medicaid work requirements included in the House bill, which would require adult recipients to prove that they are working at least 80 hours per month to maintain their health coverage. People with disabilities would also likely be required to prove they qualify for exceptions, and all enrollees would face more paperwork and barriers to coverage. The policy would reduce federal spending by $280 billion over 10 years by kicking people off Medicaid rolls.\nThe White House said on Monday that \u201c4.8 million able-bodied adults on Medicaid are choosing not to work,\u201d a claim also made by Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, who recently told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press that the 4.8 million people are \u201crefusing\u201d to work and will not lose coverage \u201cif they choose too.\u201d\nHowever, as the Washington Post points out, 4.8 million is the number of people estimated to become uninsured due to work requirements, not the number of young men \u201csitting around and playing video games\u201d instead of getting a job, as Johnson has previously suggested. KFF analysis shows 92 percent of adults on Medicaid are either working or likely qualify for exceptions to work requirements, as most Medicaid enrollees who do not work are caregivers, parents, students, or have a disability.\nArkansas instituted Medicaid work requirements in 2018, which led to 18,000 adults losing health coverage over the four months before a court stepped in to halt further implementation. A study by Harvard University researchers found the work requirements were effective at cutting Medicaid rolls during that time period but had no effect on employment. Research on other states has found that few programs linked to Medicaid work requirements actually help enrollees find jobs.\nSome Republicans have outright lied about the reconciliation bill, suggesting they are not pursuing Medicaid cuts when they are. Others are resorting to callous mockery. When constituents confronted Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa at a recent town hall with questions about people dying without health coverage, she shrugged and told them: \u201cWell, we all are going to die.\u201d\nAfter a video of the exchange went viral, Ernst doubled down with a bizarre video in what appears to be a graveyard, suggesting that those who are afraid of preventable deaths under the Medicaid cuts are like children who believe in the tooth fairy and should embrace \u201cmy lord and savior, Jesus Christ.\u201d\n\u201cSen. Ernst\u2019s flippant comments over the weekend reveal a grim reality: Republicans in Congress know that their tax bill will rip away lifesaving health care from their constituents, jeopardizing lives just to pad billionaires\u2019 pockets \u2026 and they just don\u2019t care,\u201d said Kobie Christian, a spokesperson for the economic justice campaign Unrig Our Economy, in a statement.\nThe \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d will likely undergo changes in the Senate, where conservative fiscal hawks are anxious about increasing the federal deficit, and defenders of public health refuse to blow holes in a safety net that provides coverage for millions of people in order to pay for tax cuts.\n\u201cIn the wealthiest country in the world, we should be guaranteeing health care to all as a human right, not taking health care away from millions of seniors and working families to pay for tax breaks for billionaires,\u201d Sanders said.\nKeep the press free.

Rural hospitals across the U.S. \u2014 many already hanging by a thread \u2014 could take a serious hit if a proposed Medicaid cut in the Senate\u2019s domestic spending bill is signed into law.\nThe provision, outlined in the 549-page bill released by the Senate Finance Committee on Monday, would gradually limit states\u2019 use of Medicaid\u2019s so-called provider tax.\nMedicaid is jointly funded by the federal government and states. States cover the upfront cost of care and then are reimbursed by the federal government for at least 50%.\nThe provider tax is a state-imposed fee on hospitals and other health care providers to help fund a state\u2019s share of the Medicaid program. When states use provider funds to boost their Medicaid spending, the federal government gives them more money because it's required to match it.\nThe tax must apply to all providers within a class \u2014 so if a state wants to tax hospitals, it must include all licensed hospitals. Most states have multiple provider taxes, including taxes for nursing facilities and ambulance services, said Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy who focuses primarily on Medicaid.\nAll states, except for Alaska, have at least one provider tax, Park said. A good chunk of the money raised goes toward supporting rural hospitals, which often serve a higher share of low-income and Medicaid patients.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a key financing source for rural hospitals, which tend to have much thinner operating margins,\u201d Park said. In recent years, he added, rural hospitals have \u201chad a rash of closures, staff cuts and service cuts\u201d due to financial hardship.\nA report from the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform, a think tank, found that one-third of all rural hospitals are at risk of closing.\nThe Senate proposal would gradually reduce the provider\u2019s tax rate of 6% or less to 3.5% by 2031, according to Monday\u2019s outline. States that haven\u2019t expanded Medicaid, such as Florida and Texas, would get to keep their rates at their current levels.\nTaxes on nursing homes and intermediate care facilities, which provide services for people with disabilities, are exempt from the new limit.\nDr. Adam Gaffney, a critical care physician and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, said the Senate\u2019s proposal is more aggressive than the House\u2019s version, which proposes freezing the provider tax rate at its current level and barring states from implementing new taxes.\nGaffney published a study on Monday that found the Medicaid cuts proposed in the House bill could cause an estimated 7.6 million Americans to lose health insurance, leading to thousands of preventable deaths.\nUnder the Senate\u2019s proposal, Gaffney said rural hospitals will likely be forced to reduce the services they offer, cut staff or close altogether. Many more patients would also likely die, he added, because they no longer have a hospital nearby.\nA report from the Pew Research Center found rural Americans live an average of 10.5 miles or 17 minutes from the nearest hospital \u2014 about twice as far and five to seven minutes longer than people in suburban and urban areas.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way around it. It\u2019s just basic math,\u201d Gaffney said. \u201cIt means more harm, and that more people will die from lack of care.\u201d\nGaffney said Republicans should be taking steps to keep hospitals in rural areas, where many of their voters live, open.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, hospitals that are in places where patients are poor tend to be poor and to be more at risk of closure,\u201d he said.\nKevin Stansbury, the CEO of the Lincoln Community Hospital, a 25-bed rural hospital in Hugo, Colorado, said his business is unlikely to survive under the proposed changes.\nStansbury said his hospital serves an area roughly the size of Connecticut but has only about two providers per square mile. About 25% of his patients are on Medicaid.\nThe hospital receives about $300,000 a month in provider tax reimbursements, which he said are \u201cessential for us to keep our doors open\u201d and is still only enough to break even.\nWithout the 6% provider tax rate, he will likely have to start cutting services for patients, including long-term care, he said.\n\u201cIf I start crying, forgive me,\u201d Stansbury said. \u201cIt just breaks my heart.\u201d\nThe proposed cuts in the Senate bill are not final and may not end up in the version that reaches President Donald Trump\u2019s desk.\nIf the Senate\u2019s provider tax changes do make it through to the final bill, they are likely to be deeply unpopular among the public, said Robin Rudowitz, director of the program on Medicaid and the uninsured at KFF, a nonprofit group that focuses on health policy.\nPolling shows that about 3 in 4 rural residents say funding for Medicaid should increase or stay the same, Rudowitz said. About three-quarters of people living in rural areas, she added, say that Medicaid is very important to people in their communities.\n\u201cChanges that would restrict or retrench coverage gains could have negative implications for these hospitals,\u201d she said.\nRural hospitals groups are already pushing back on the proposed limits on the provider tax.\nIn an emailed statement, Bruce Siegel, the president and CEO of America\u2019s Essential Hospitals, a nonprofit group that advocates for hospitals serving poor communities, said the Senate\u2019s changes \u201cwould devastate health care access for millions of Americans and hollow out the vital role essential hospitals play in their communities.\u201d\nIn a release Tuesday, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, slammed the proposed cuts.\n\u201cSenate Republicans would pay for those new corporate tax breaks by making even deeper cuts to Medicaid, slashing funding for rural hospitals and other essential health care providers and throwing cash-strapped states off a funding cliff,\u201d Wyden said."]}, {"topic": 16, "name": "Harvard vs Trump Administration", "keywords": "students, harvard, education, international, university, foreign, to, student, department, campus", "documents": ["Federal judge extends order blocking Trump administration ban on foreign students at Harvard.

In a lawsuit filed Friday in federal court in Boston, Harvard said the government\u2019s action violates the First Amendment and will have an \u201cimmediate and devastating effect for Harvard and more than 7,000 visa holders.\u201d \u201cWith the stroke of a pen, the government has sought to erase a quarter of Harvard\u2019s student body, international students who contribute significantly to the University and its mission,\u201d Harvard said in its suit. \u201cWithout its international students, Harvard is not Harvard.\u201d The school said it plans to file for a temporary restraining order to block the Department of Homeland Security from carrying out the move. The move has thrown campus into disarray days before graduation, Harvard said in the suit. International students who run labs, teach courses, assist professors and participate in Harvard sports are now left deciding whether to transfer or risk losing legal status to stay in the country, according to the filing. The impact is heaviest at graduate schools such as the Harvard Kennedy School, where almost half the student body comes from abroad, and Harvard Business School, which is about one-third international. Along with its impact on current students, the move blocks thousands of students who were planning to come for summer and fall classes. Harvard said it immediately puts the school at a disadvantage as it competes for the world\u2019s top students. Even if it regains the ability to host students, \u201cfuture applicants may shy away from applying out of fear of further reprisals from the government,\u201d the suit said. If the government\u2019s action stands, Harvard said, the university would be unable to offer admission to new international students for at least the next two academic years. Schools that have that certification withdrawn by the federal government are ineligible to reapply until one year afterward, Harvard said. Harvard enrolls almost 6,800 foreign students at its campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Most are graduate students and they come from more than 100 countries. The department announced the action Thursday, accusing Harvard of creating an unsafe campus environment by allowing \u201canti-American, pro-terrorist agitators\u201d to assault Jewish students on campus. It also accused Harvard of coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party, contending the school had hosted and trained members of a Chinese paramilitary group as recently as 2024. Harvard President Alan Garber earlier this month said the university has made changes to its governance over the past year and a half, including a broad strategy to combat antisemitism, He said Harvard would not budge on its \u201cits core, legally-protected principles\u201d over fears of retaliation. Harvard has said it will respond at a later time to allegations first raised by House Republicans about coordination with the Chinese Communist Party. The threat to Harvard\u2019s international enrollment stems from an April 16 request from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who demanded that Harvard provide information about foreign students that might implicate them in violence or protests that could lead to their deportation. Noem said Harvard can regain its ability to host foreign students if it produces a trove of records on foreign students within 72 hours. Her updated request demands all records, including audio or video footage, of foreign students participating in protests or dangerous activity on campus. The suit is separate from the university\u2019s earlier one challenging more than $2 billion in federal cuts imposed by the Republican administration.

If the government\u2019s action stands, Harvard said, the university would be unable to offer admission to new international students for at least the next two academic years. Schools that have that certification withdrawn by the federal government are ineligible to reapply until one year afterward, Harvard said. Harvard enrolls almost 6,800 foreign students at its campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Most are graduate students and they come from more than 100 countries. The department announced the action Thursday, accusing Harvard of creating an unsafe campus environment by allowing \u201canti-American, pro-terrorist agitators\u201d to assault Jewish students on campus. It also accused Harvard of coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party, contending the school had hosted and trained members of a Chinese paramilitary group as recently as 2024. Harvard President Alan Garber earlier this month said the university has made changes to its governance over the past year and a half, including a broad strategy to combat antisemitism, He said Harvard would not budge on its \u201cits core, legally-protected principles\u201d over fears of retaliation. Harvard has said it will respond at a later time to allegations first raised by House Republicans about coordination with the Chinese Communist Party. The threat to Harvard\u2019s international enrollment stems from an April 16 request from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who demanded that Harvard provide information about foreign students that might implicate them in violence or protests that could lead to their deportation. Noem said Harvard can regain its ability to host foreign students if it produces a trove of records on foreign students within 72 hours. Her updated request demands all records, including audio or video footage, of foreign students participating in protests or dangerous activity on campus. The suit is separate from the university\u2019s earlier one challenging more than $2 billion in federal cuts imposed by the Republican administration.

Now the cleanup is lagging on his watch.. Trump undermined Biden\u2019s FEMA in North Carolina. Now the cleanup is lagging on his watch.\nAs a candidate, the president spread misinformation about the Hurricane Helene recovery efforts, convincing many survivors that the federal government was out to get them.\nBrandon Rogers fielded calls from as far away as Australia as his community strained to recover from the worst natural disaster ever to hit his slice of western North Carolina. Texts poured in by the hundreds. The influx kept the Haywood County commissioner and his staff busy as they coordinated an unimaginable humanitarian recovery.\nThe messages were distractions. Worse, actually: They were the budding flowers of misinformation, seeds that were planted just days after Hurricane Helene killed scores of people, destroyed entire towns and set western North Carolina on an uncertain, unwieldy path to rebuilding.\nThe hollers of western North Carolina are rather insular, with strong community ties owed in some equal measures to its mountainous geography, poor infrastructure and deep well of history. The storm hitting a place like that produced a greatest hits list of conspiracies: The Federal Emergency Management Agency wanted to push people off their land to access lithium deposits; then-President Joe Biden directed the storm to the Republican-heavy area; FEMA assistance was a loan that needed to be repaid at usurious rates.\nRogers received a death threat over the county\u2019s recovery efforts. An email chain letter claiming 28 babies froze to death in FEMA tents appeared in his inbox. Angry citizens from outside the county poured into a commission meeting demanding answers for tragedies that never occurred.\n\u201cIt was just people watching this stuff that believed it,\u201d said Rogers, who is a Republican. \u201cI\u2019d be upset, too, if it\u2019s true. But it wasn\u2019t true.\u201d\nThe misinformation deterred countless people from seeking federal assistance, according to Rogers and other local officials, legal aid groups and community nonprofits interviewed by POLITICO over the nearly eight months since Helene ravaged a slice of Appalachia that had never before given a Category 4 hurricane any thought.\nAt one point this winter, just 15 percent of eligible North Carolina households had applied for FEMA assistance. While the North Carolina Office of the State Auditor data shows those numbers have improved, major gaps remain: Of the 6,930 people who are eligible for housing assistance because insurance or charities did not cover costs, more than 3,700 people \u2014 53 percent \u2014 are not pursuing available federal aid.\nDisaster experts cautioned against comparing recoveries because they are all unique, but noted that people who refuse federal help often undermine a region\u2019s rebound. That is playing out in North Carolina, where thousands of people have foregone assistance that could pay for basic needs, rebuild nearly 1,000 destroyed and 74,000 damaged homes, and put communities mourning the 107 lives lost across the state back together.\nThere was one prominent person seizing on the misinformation for his own purposes: Donald Trump. As a candidate, Trump leveled the baseless accusation that the Biden administration was diverting FEMA assistance from North Carolina to house illegal immigrants. He claimed $1 billion of FEMA spending was \u201cstolen\u201d for migrants. He said all FEMA had to offer people in North Carolina was $750, which was not true.\nThe allegations spurred anger toward Biden, but FEMA\u2019s statistics show no significant uptick in aid since Trump\u2019s inauguration. As of April 22, the agency had given nearly $432 million of assistance to 158,600 households in North Carolina, $100 million of which came under Trump, FEMA said in a statement. FEMA also obligated nearly $459 million in public assistance to repair infrastructure in North Carolina, including $138 million under Trump.\nMeanwhile, Trump\u2019s FEMA has halted $10 billion in disaster relief funds intended to help people across the country, cut off housing assistance for thousands of Helene survivors and ended a policy of fully reimbursing the state of North Carolina for debris removal.\nNow, in further evidence of how political attacks can create a reality of their own, Trump officials are using FEMA\u2019s struggles in western North Carolina as a rationale to dismantle the agency.\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to recommend that FEMA go away,\u201d Trump said during a January visit to Asheville to survey the damage shortly after taking office.\nAt a congressional hearing on May 6, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who oversees FEMA, called the agency a failure and reiterated that Trump believes \u201cFEMA as it exists today should be eliminated.\u201d Trump fired then-acting FEMA chief Cameron Hamilton on May 8, just one day after Hamilton told a House committee the agency should not be abolished. His replacement, David Richardson, warned staff: \u201cI will run right over you.\u201d\nStaff reductions, programmatic cuts and leadership changes at FEMA have raised questions about the preparedness of the nation\u2019s premier disaster response agency. Its performance will be closely watched as the nation readies for the Atlantic hurricane season, which federal forecasters will preview Thursday.\nNeither the White House nor FEMA responded to questions about Trump\u2019s past claims about FEMA\u2019s Helene efforts. DHS also did not respond to requests for comment.\nAs to the president\u2019s plans for FEMA, a White House official said the federal government will focus \u201con truly catastrophic disasters\u201d while continuing to provide assistance for search-and-rescue missions after devastating events. But the official said state and local governments \u201coften remain an impediment to their own community\u2019s resilience,\u201d and that Trump\u2019s policies aim to prod them into more proactive posture.\n\u201cStates must have adequate emergency management staff, adoption and enforcement of modern building codes, responsible planning and strategic investment to reduce future risk,\u201d the official said, saying states must have their own \u201ccommonsense policies that prioritize preparedness over politics, disaster reserve funds to handle what should be routine emergencies, pre-negotiated mutual aid and contingency contracts that speed up recovery, and above all, an appetite to own the problem.\u201d\nWhatever the policy merits of Trump\u2019s disaster-relief plans, they feel like a bait and switch to some people struggling to recover from Helene: After blaming Biden for faltering relief efforts, Trump has seemed more focused on trashing FEMA than boosting the recovery in North Carolina.\nTravis Gresham of Canton, a town 20 miles west of Asheville, accuses Trump of setting FEMA up to fail. The president\u2019s conspiracy-laced campaign attacks convinced her neighbors to shun the agency, which has delayed reconstruction of a private road and bridge, Gresham said. The surrounding community fell into the false claims like Biden pushed a button to send the hurricane to western North Carolina, that FEMA is merely a tool of the Democratic Party, and that the agency wanted to clear the land for lithium mining. Her neighbors believe everything Trump says because they view him as a \u201cgolden god,\u201d Gresham said.\n\u201cHe knew what he was doing,\u201d said Gresham, who often votes for Democratic candidates. \u201cHe was setting the stage for what his agenda was: That FEMA is a joke. It\u2019s not a good system, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a plan to fix it or overhaul it and make it better. I think it\u2019s a plan to eliminate it.\u201d\n\u201cIf you take the boots off the ground here the people are not going to try to get the help. The help will be over,\u201d Gresham added. \u201cI don\u2019t think we will ever recover here. Not fully.\u201d\nImmediately after Helene struck, candidate Trump made clear that disaster relief was a federal responsibility and that blame for recovery failures rested with Biden.\n\u201cThey sacrificed Americans to an Open Border, and now, they have left Americans to drown in North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, and elsewhere in the South,\u201d he posted Sept. 30 on Truth Social. \u201cUnder this Administration, Americans always come last, because we have \u2018leaders\u2019 who have no idea how to lead!\u201d\nHis criticisms found a receptive audience in western North Carolina, the region\u2019s residents said. There\u2019s a deep mistrust of the federal government in those rural communities. Locals draw pride from self-sufficiency, maintaining generational ties to the land. It\u2019s also nearly devoid of local news outlets, making it the type of environment where anti-government conspiracy theories flourish.\n\u201cAppalachia is much more of a mirror of America than we\u2019re willing to fully embrace or realize,\u201d said Ryan Eller, executive director of Appalachia Funders Network, a philanthropy that invests in the region. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of a canary in a coal mine if we continue to have this degradation of local press, of trust, and allow the response infrastructure for storms not to meet the moment that we\u2019re in where these storms are so frequent and destructive.\u201d\nTrump visited western North Carolina four days after his inauguration, just weeks after Vice President JD Vance toured the region during the presidential transition. It was at that January appearance when Trump first suggested that FEMA should be abolished.\nMany officials in western North Carolina agree that FEMA needs changing. Even longtime FEMA officials acknowledge that the agency\u2019s rules can be cumbersome, especially for people under duress after a catastrophe. Local aid workers familiar with the way FEMA operates said people often mistakenly fail to appeal FEMA denials of assistance, which are routine enough to be more of a feature of the system than a bug. The money comes too slowly, as some people interviewed for this article are still waiting on federal dollars to rebuild after Tropical Storm Fred hit the area in 2021.\nBut those complaints have been overshadowed by the numerous unwieldy conspiracies that sprouted in Helene\u2019s aftermath \u2014 that FEMA never arrived, that it stole supplies, that it took property, that it ran out of money because it spent it on assisting migrants, former FEMA officials, aid workers and community organizers said.\nPoliticians in red pockets of the country \u2014 which absorb far more FEMA assistance than heavily Democratic areas \u2014 are walking a fine line. They want FEMA to remain on the ground. But as they decry misinformation and call for reforms, they stop short of blaming Trump for amplifying the very misinformation that now threatens the agency\u2019s future. They do not want to offend Trump or his supporters, but now face the challenge of balancing partisan anger with local needs to preserve some semblance of the agency they\u2019ve loudly criticized.\n\u201cI think he\u2019s correct in calling out the fact that they failed us,\u201d state Rep. Mark Pless, a Republican, said of Trump. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t give credibility to the stories and the lies that are being spread. Just because he said FEMA failed us does not make these stories credible.\u201d\nBefore the misinformation came clear, accurate information from the National Weather Service: Helene would soon bring catastrophic flooding, property damage and death to western North Carolina.\nThe weather service is a part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the nation\u2019s primary climate and weather research service. It\u2019s a public-safety agency that informs people of imminent storms. Its meteorologists work in field offices around the country, developing relationships with mayors, local emergency managers and often TV weather people \u2014 who are among the most trusted local celebrities, according to polling.\nThe warnings from the National Weather Service office covering western North Carolina proved prescient. Its first post on the social media site X at 12:16 p.m. Sept. 24 stated, \u201cTropical Storm #Helene has now formed & will impact us later this week. It is a very large storm & we can expect VERY heavy rainfall & gusty winds.\u201d Less than six hours later, the agency said its confidence of significant flood threats beginning Sept. 26 continued to increase, with \u201cpotential to be an extremely rare event.\u201d\nSuccessive posts noted severe flash flooding, strong winds and power outages were likely. On Sept. 25 \u2014 one day before Helene hit the Florida panhandle \u2014 the weather service predicted between 10 and 15 inches of total rainfall and put the area under a tropical storm warning. North Carolina would meet Helene within 36 hours, the meteorologists cautioned.\nHelene arrived Sept. 27. The strongest gusts measured up to 105 mph in the southern Appalachian Mountains, according to NOAA\u2019s National Hurricane Center. Rainfall between 20 and 31 inches, dropping at rates of 2 to 3 inches per hour, flooded the region\u2019s rocky crags. Most of the storm\u2019s 34 flash-flood emergencies occurred in western North Carolina.\nThe National Hurricane Center now counts Helene as \u201cthe most devastating natural disaster in western North Carolina\u2019s history,\u201d killing 107 people, destroying 822,000 acres of timber land, demolishing or damaging tens of thousands of homes.\nHelene even forced the temporary closure of NOAA\u2019s National Centers for Environmental Information, the Asheville office that produces an annual report of U.S. natural disasters causing $1 billion in damage. (Trump canceled that report and ceased updating its public database this month, citing \u201cevolving priorities, statutory mandates, and staffing changes.\u201d) Just about everyone at the office knows someone who lost their home or a loved one in the storm, NCEI physical scientist Jared Rennie said. Even with an incredibly accurate NWS forecast that gave people days to evacuate, scores of North Carolinians perished.\n\u201cI have meteorologist survivor\u2019s guilt,\u201d he said. \u201cIt hurts. Even to this day.\u201d\nRennie was aware that skepticism of climate change had bred distrust of the federal government in this corner of North Carolina, a mountainous area of rural villages surrounding the city of Asheville, which is noted for its literary past. While affluent Asheville itself is politically liberal, the surrounding area is among the poorest and most conservative in the state. The two hardest hit neighboring counties \u2014 Avery and Haywood \u2014 voted 76.4 and 61.6 percent for Trump in 2016, 75.8 and 62.5 percent in 2020 and 75.7 and 61.8 percent in 2024, respectively.\nRennie sometimes speaks about climate science to rural audiences, and has seen the distrust up close, even as catastrophic storms made the risk to average people more vivid: A collective of researchers using advanced computer models said climate change had made Helene wetter and windier, dramatically increasing the risk to western North Carolina.\nBut the type of misinformation targeting the federal government that Rennie witnessed after Hurricane Helene differed from the climate skepticism he\u2019s battled in the past. Community members complained that FEMA was absent when Rennie said he himself had witnessed FEMA officials on the ground. Some of the criticism may have gained credibility from the amount of time it took for FEMA to navigate dangerous terrain and reach far-flung homes. Roads and bridges were destroyed, swallowed by crested rivers or sawed in half by fallen boulders. Entire towns like Swannanoa and Chimney Rock were wiped out. Internet and cellular phone service evaporated. People felt they were on their own.\n\u201cDisinformation can spread like wildfire,\u201d Rennie said. \u201cMy personal opinion is that created that whole rift of, \u2018Oh, FEMA is the bad guy.\u2019\u201d\nThe most pernicious rumor was that Helene survivors could only get $750, a misreading of federal policy. That was the amount that survivors could get under a new FEMA policy introduced in March 2024 to give them immediate cash in addition to other available assistance. It was the first hurricane season with that new funding, which FEMA believed would help build confidence in the agency. But Trump spread the misinformation that $750 was all that FEMA would offer North Carolina residents.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happened there is very bad. They\u2019re offering them $750 to people whose homes have been washed away,\u201d Trump said at an Oct. 5 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, eliciting a round of boos from the crowd. \u201cAnd yet we send tens of billions of dollars to foreign countries that most people have never heard of. They\u2019re offering them $750. They\u2019ve been destroyed. These people have been destroyed.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s megaphone became difficult to overcome.\n\u201cIt was very hard to get past that message that $750 isn\u2019t the only assistance available,\u201d said Alicia Edwards, disaster relief project director with Legal Aid for North Carolina, which offers free legal services to low-income residents. \u201cIt was surprising. I wasn\u2019t prepared for that.\u201d\nUnlike Florida, Texas and other coastal areas more prone to hurricanes and accustomed to working with FEMA, western North Carolina had never experienced this level of destruction \u2014 or had as much of an occasion to contend with FEMA\u2019s bureaucracy. Elderly and less tech-savvy residents struggled to navigate it. Many people gave up when they hit common FEMA obstacles, such as providing specific documentation, Edwards and other local aid workers said.\nOther survivors came to believe falsehoods that FEMA assistance was a government loan. In more sinister versions, FEMA would take children or property if people could not repay those fictitious loans. Scores of residents chose to live in tents on their property to ward off FEMA, said Rogers, the Haywood County commissioner.\nThere were claims that ranged from ridiculous to the tin-foil-hat variety: That FEMA was never there at all or that its officials were absconding with people\u2019s personal supplies and tents, according to residents, aid workers and a review of internet rumors.\nEven months after the storm, the perception that FEMA worked against the interests of reeling North Carolina communities lingers.\nBobby Minor is a 71-year-old man who lived in the Asheville area before moving 140 miles to the east to Advance, which was not directly affected by the hurricane. In an effort to help his former neighbors, he and his wife brought and delivered basic goods on several trips to the areas since Helene hit. He said in an interview that under the Biden administration, FEMA had purposely stinted on aid to the conservative mountainous region, claiming that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers first appeared one week after Trump\u2019s January visit. (In fact, the Army Corps said it arrived in the state Sept. 26 to establish operational support for FEMA and arrived in western North Carolina by Sept. 29.)\n\u201cMost people say, \u2018We haven\u2019t even seen them,\u2019\u201d Minor said of FEMA. \u201cSounds like that is almost by design.\u201d\nAs those perceptions of being left behind quickly swelled into anti-FEMA sentiment, politicians seized on the opportunity to capitalize on the growing distrust of government officials at every level of government, local officials said.\nIn Haywood County, commissioner Terry Ramey joined a YouTube channel run by Tennessee-based influencer John Ward, which was the source of many false claims. On the channel, Ramey asserted that the county itself had blocked temporary shelter for Helene survivors. The county\u2019s four other commissioners and Pless, the county\u2019s state representative, rebuked Ramey. Neither Ward nor Ramey responded to requests for comment.\n\u201cI\u2019ve sat back there and I\u2019ve kind of vibrated while I\u2019ve watched this show \u2014 and this is a show. And there are a lot of people sitting in this room that need to go home,\u201d Pless said at the meeting. \u201cTerry, this is to you: You can sit there all day long, and you can say you ain\u2019t started nothing. Everybody knows it\u2019s a lie. The bad part is is these people are going to turn on you the second that you don\u2019t do something they want to do.\u201d\nInflamed by the anti-government sentiments, several citizen groups interfered with FEMA\u2019s delivery of humanitarian-relief supplies when they continued their own supply runs out of the Hickory, Lincolnton and Statesville airports even after the state asked them to stand down, said Mark Bumgarner, executive director of Catawba County United Way. He said those groups of citizens hoped to throttle FEMA\u2019s operations because they did not believe its aid would reach local people.\n\u201cThis got a bit tricky for us as politicians who were involved with these groups at the airports,\u201d Bumgarner wrote in an email. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, the citizen groups provided a much-needed service the first couple of days before FEMA could fully mobilize. But in the developing FEMA involvement, I was shocked they were feeding misinformation to folks looking to donate.\u201d\nIt didn\u2019t help that Trump \u201cutilized fear\u201d to politicize the disaster, said Amber Dixon, director of community health initiatives at the Boone, North Carolina-based Western Youth Network.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be there shortly, but don\u2019t like the reports that I\u2019m getting about the Federal Government, and the Democrat Governor of the State, going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas,\u201d Trump wrote Sept. 30 on Truth Social. That same day, he said on Fox News that, \u201cThey\u2019re being treated very badly in the Republican areas. \u2026 They\u2019re not getting water, they\u2019re not getting anything.\u201d\nDixon said she worried that politicization would prolong the area\u2019s recovery by dissuading people from pursuing help \u2014 fears that have since come to pass.\n\u201cIf you look at the number of FEMA applications versus the number of impacted households, there\u2019s a huge discrepancy,\u201d she said just days before Trump\u2019s January inauguration. \u201cIt\u2019s a numbers game. If you continually tell someone that you don\u2019t need something, then that resource will, by default, go away.\u201d\nDonella Pressley has heard it all.\n\u201cIf you didn\u2019t see them you had your blinders on, because they were here,\u201d Pressley said of FEMA.\nThe 50-year-old Canton resident has zero reason to defend FEMA. She\u2019s spent several frustrating years working with the agency trying to rebuild a home destroyed by Tropical Storm Fred in 2021. Since that time, Pressley and her two children have bounced between staying with friends and in hotels. Last year, FEMA finally began disbursing money. The money stopped when Trump took over \u2014 FEMA ceased paying hotel bills for thousands of North Carolinians this winter.\nPressley said FEMA needs simplifying and fixing, sure. But \u201cthat doesn\u2019t start with getting rid of it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt works for some. It may not be working for everyone. But I don\u2019t see disasters stopping.\u201d\nEven some FEMA critics at Helene\u2019s ground zero, which was 30 minutes east of Pressley\u2019s home, said they need the agency\u2019s help. Congressional Republicans also said they don\u2019t want FEMA to disappear from the scene entirely. Yet the misinformation that swirled around FEMA after Helene has further politicized the agency, shaking its foundation as the nation\u2019s premier first responders to climate-fueled disasters.\n\u201cFEMA shouldn\u2019t really be subject to political debates or even the tides that shift from ideological pole to pole,\u201d said Eller, of the Appalachia Funders Network. \u201cI don\u2019t think disasters are partisan, and so the recovery shouldn\u2019t be either. And I just think that FEMA needs stable, sufficient funding to operate at the scale of today\u2019s climate reality and the demands of our communities.\u201d\nNow, western North Carolina continues to suffer, but it is unclear how much longer FEMA officials will remain on the ground.\nEnding FEMA\u2019s role in long-term recovery would remove from western North Carolina the scores of officials assisting people like Pressley in processing forms for housing assistance from earlier disasters. Officials would have to end or cut back on efforts to help communities plan early for ways to rebuild bridges and roads, restore power grids and clear debris.\nThe changes are already happening. On March 29, FEMA pulled out of its North Carolina disaster recovery centers without explanation. In April, it stopped providing 100 percent reimbursement for state recovery expenses, leaving North Carolina to figure out how it will pay for the rest of its work.\nTrump\u2019s FEMA has closed the spigot on other funds, too. It halted disbursement from $10 billion of disaster relief programs to assess whether those funds flow to illegal immigrants \u2014 an evolution of the misinformation that Trump himself spouted on the campaign trail.\nA FEMA retreat would hurt North Carolinians struggling to recover from Helene, said Max Gibbons, director of pro bono services with Pisgah Legal Services. He acknowledged many \u201chiccups\u201d in FEMA\u2019s cumbersome process, but insisted that state and local governments cannot fill the void.\n\u201cWe see that every single day where FEMA is their one source of recovery,\u201d Gibbons said of his clients, many of whom have endured generations of family poverty. \u201cWithout the federal funding it would be difficult for the state to meet the need.\u201d\nThose needs will grow. Climate change has intensified and made events like Helene more frequent \u2014 some of the FEMA officials deployed to North Carolina were in Florida just days before to respond to Hurricane Milton. More people now live in areas vulnerable to disasters like hurricanes, floods and wildfires than ever before. Last year, the U.S. experienced 27 disasters totaling $1 billion in damage. It was the second-highest number of such events in one year, behind only the 28 in 2023.\nTrump\u2019s FEMA is cutting programs that would blunt the effects of those storms, said Michael Coen, who was FEMA chief of staff in the Obama and Biden administrations. In April, FEMA canceled billions of dollars in funding for the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program that started in Trump\u2019s first term, steering funding away from projects designed to reduce damage before disasters strike. Coen noted Trump also took an unprecedented step by withholding hazard mitigation grant funding in an April disaster declaration for Virginia, a largely routine measure that unlocks money to safeguard infrastructure from future disasters.\nEfforts to buy flooded homes from residents seeking to move on from vulnerable properties may also fall victim to Trump\u2019s cuts, Coen added. Congress increased that funding with $3.5 billion in the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law, but much of it remains unspent. The rumors of FEMA taking North Carolina property against people\u2019s will damaged the program\u2019s reputation.\nOn top of that, seasoned FEMA leaders are expected to be pushed out or laid off amid the massive cuts and reorganization, said a former senior FEMA official who was granted anonymity to avoid retribution. That could leave the agency unprepared for the hurricane season that begins June 1.\nSome past leaders believe FEMA has been stretched too thin by increasingly frequent disasters and needs to be streamlined, with some of its functions passed off to other federal agencies.\nBrock Long, who ran FEMA in the first Trump administration, told a climate tech conference in Washington last month that the agency has become \u201ca dumping ground for all the nation\u2019s complex problems,\u201d ranging from dealing with unhoused populations to restoring power grids. He said states and private insurers need to shoulder more of the load. But he said the federal government should maintain a role.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a relatively misunderstood agency with great intentions,\u201d he said at the April event.\nMany simply want speedier responses to disasters that pile up one on top of the other. They want less bureaucracy to get money for rebuilding.\n\u201cWe had folks here that were literally boots on the ground the morning after the storm,\u201d Rogers said of FEMA. \u201cUnless they\u2019ve got the open checkbook at that moment it\u2019s like, \u2018What are you doing?\u2019\u201d\nRogers intimately understands the many levels of frustration in the response, but he has also seen what ills can come of government skepticism. He stared them in the face at a three-plus hour Dec. 2, 2024, commission meeting, where he responded to accusations about FEMA and the county. He ticked off a long list of responses to conspiracies about the county and FEMA: \u201cThere has been zero kids took out of a tent, a camper, anything because of this flood situation\u201d and \u201cwe do not want to seize anybody\u2019s property,\u201d among others.\nRogers lamented how misinformation besieged and complicated the recovery. How it infiltrated his neighbors\u2019 minds and conversations. How it all could contribute to dismantling FEMA \u2014 which, for all its faults, is still in the thick of it, trying to get Haywood County back on its feet.\n\u201cI would like to see them engage with the system,\u201d Rogers said of his constituents in an interview. \u201cI want them to get the help that they deserve.\u201d", "Hurricane Erick threatens to bring flooding and mudslides to Mexico&#8217;s Pacific coast.

READ MORE: Experts concerned over cuts to key federal agencies as hurricane season starts The National Hurricane Center in Miami said Erick had maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (155 kph). The cyclone was rapidly intensifying and is expected to become a major hurricane. Erick was located in the eastern Pacific Ocean about 105 miles (165 kilometers) south of Puerto \u00c1ngel and about 215 miles (345 kilometers) southeast of Punta Maldonado. Up to 20 inches (51 centimeters) of rain could fall across the Mexican states of Oaxaca and Guerrero, with lighter amounts in Chiapas, Michoacan, Colima and Jalisco states, the Miami-based U.S. National Hurricane Center said in an advisory. The rainfall threatened flooding and mudslides, especially in areas with steep terrain. The hurricane center said Erick is rapidly intensifying and is expected to be at or near major hurricane status as it approaches the Mexican coast on Thursday, where it could make landfall. A major hurricane is defined as Category 3 or higher and wind speeds of at least 111 mph (180 kph). Erick is forecast to be a major hurricane by Wednesday night or Thursday morning. The storm\u2019s projected path would take its center near the resort of Acapulco, which was devastated in October 2023 by Hurricane Otis, a Category 5 hurricane that rapidly intensified and caught many unprepared. At least 52 people died in Otis and 32 were missing, after the storm severely damaged almost all of the resort\u2019s hotels. Down the coast in Puerto Escondido near the southern edge of Erick\u2019s possible path, some fishermen began pulling their boats out of the water under a drizzling sky Wednesday.

Laura Vel\u00e1zquez, Mexico\u2019s national civil defense coordinator, said Wednesday that Erick was forecast to bring \u201ctorrential\u201d rains to Guerrero, Oaxaca and Chiapas in southern Mexico. The mountainous region along the coast is especially prone to mudslides and there are numerous rivers that could jump their banks. Thousands of troops were being deployed to the area, Vel\u00e1zquez said. Guerrero Gov.

Acapulco\u2019s port closed Tuesday evening. She said 582 shelters were prepared to receive people who might evacuate their homes. One of the criticisms of the government\u2019s handling of Hurricane Otis was that authorities did not give sufficient warning about the threat posed by the rapidly intensifying storm. Many boats sank in Acapulco\u2019s harbor. President Claudia Sheinbaum during her daily news briefing Wednesday warned residents in the hurricane\u2019s path to listen for government instructions and to wait it out in their homes or government shelters. A hurricane warning was in effect from Acapulco to Puerto \u00c1ngel.

Experts are alarmed over the large-scale staff reductions, travel and training restrictions and grant cut-offs since President Donald Trump took office at both the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which prepares for and responds to hurricanes, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which tracks and forecasts them. \u201cMy nightmare is a major catastrophic storm hitting an area that is reeling from the impact of all of this nonsense from the Trump administration and people will die. And that could happen in Florida, that could happen in Texas, that could happen in South Carolina,\u201d said Susan Cutter, the director of the Hazards and Vulnerability Research Institute at the University of South Carolina. Representatives of both NOAA and FEMA say the agencies are prepared. Experts: DOGE cuts diminish FEMA About 2,000 full-time staff have left FEMA since Trump took office in January, a loss of roughly one-third of the agency\u2019s full-time workforce, amid Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) mandated cuts. Scholars who study emergency management are concerned by both the reduction in capacity and the \u201cbrain drain\u201d of experienced staff. \u201cThere\u2019s really been a brain drain within FEMA in addition to the loss of overall employees,\u201d said Samantha Montano, who teaches emergency management at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy. She noted that many who left were in critical management positions. The agency is run by an acting chief, David Richardson, a former Marine Corps officer who served overseas and worked as the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s assistant secretary for countering weapons of mass destruction. He does not appear to have any experience in managing disasters. Emergency management requires knowing where to get things, who to call, how things work and how to get it done quickly \u2014 which comes from experience and establishing relationships with state officials, Montano and Cutter said. What\u2019s happening reminds former Federal Emergency Management Agency Director Craig Fugate of 2005, the year Hurricane Katrina devastated Louisiana and exposed inexperienced and poorly prepared governments at all levels, especially the then-FEMA chief who came from a horse-rearing association. Fugate said he\u2019s especially worried about top experienced disaster people leaving FEMA. FEMA canceled various emergency management trainings this spring, moved others online and restricted travel to events such as the National Hurricane Conference. Some trainings have resumed. \u201cGiven the reduction in staffing, being unable to do trainings, participate in conferences, there\u2019s potential that the federal government\u2019s ability is diminished,\u201d said former Florida Emergency Management chief Bryan Koon, now president of the disaster preparedness firm IEM. FEMA has also cut disaster resilience programs. Making areas more survivable saves up to $13 for every dollar spent, said Lori Peek, director of the Natural Hazards Center at the University of Colorado. The federal government promises to be ready for hurricane season, which runs through November. \u201cFEMA is shifting from bloated DC-centric dead weight to a lean, deployable disaster force that empowers state actors to provide relief for their citizens,\u201d Associate FEMA Administrator Geoff Harbaugh said in a email. \u201cFEMA is fully activated in preparation for hurricane season.\u201d FEMA\u2019s relationship with states Richardson promised to push more responsibilities to the states. He warned that the agency will only do what the law requires and shift more costs to states. But Koon noted that states haven\u2019t budgeted for FEMA\u2019s changes, adding: \u201cThe biggest issue right now is just the uncertainty.\u201d Some states \u2014 which coordinate disaster operations \u2014 are experienced in catastrophes, have well trained staff and will do fine, such as Texas and Florida, Fugate said. But it\u2019s the poorer states that worry the experts. The feds often pick up the entire bill in big disasters and most of it in smaller ones. In the Trump administration, disaster declarations have been denied or delayed. When disaster declarations were issued for nine states last week, some had been pending for two months and others were only partially approved. \u201cWe\u2019ve just relied on FEMA for so much for so long and not knowing who\u2019s going to fill the gap and how we\u2019re going to fill it is really scary,\u201d said University at Albany emergency management professor Jeannette Sutton. Hurricane center dodges NOAA cuts NOAA, the parent agency of the National Weather Service, has undergone a series of dramatic job cuts, with some people then reinstated. A sizable chunk of the weather service\u2019s 121 local field offices as of late March had vacancy rates of more than 20%, what\u2019s seen by outsiders as a critical level of understaffing. Local weather offices are crucial in helping people translate national warnings into what to do locally. \u201cIt should be all hands on deck and we\u2019re being hollowed out,\u201d former NWS director Louis Uccellini said. But the National Hurricane Center, which tracks and warns of hurricanes in the Atlantic, Pacific and Caribbean, has been spared. Acting NOAA Administrator Laura Grimm, National Weather Service Director Ken Graham and National Hurricane Center Director Michael Brennan said the agency is prepared for the season with the Miami-based storm center fully staffed and so are the planes that fly into storms. For the first time this year, the hurricane center will incorporate artificial intelligence into forecasting because it has shown to improve predictions generally, Brennan said. \u201cOur services have never been better,\u201d Graham said. \u201cOur ability to serve this country has never been better. And it will be this year as well.\u201d But beyond the hurricane center, weather balloons launches have been curtailed because of lack of staffing. In some places, balloon launches have dropped from twice a day to once a day. NOAA hopes to get more balloons launched if needed, Brennan said. Data from the balloons is crucial for understanding steering currents and needed for forecasts, Uccellini said. He said when hurricanes threatened during his tenure he would order the launch of several extra balloons in the Great Plains to help figure out if storms would hit the United States. \u201cHurricane forecasts, I\u2019m expecting not to be as accurate this year because of that lack of balloon data,\u2033 said former NOAA meteorologist Jeff Masters, now at Yale Climate Connections.

If there is a shared mission at this year\u2019s G7 summit, which begins Monday in Canada\u2019s Rocky Mountains, it is a desire to minimize any fireworks at a moment of combustible tensions. WATCH: Former U.S. ambassador to Israel analyzes rising Israel-Iran conflict The 2018 summit ended with Trump assailing his Canadian hosts on social media as he departed on Air Force One, saying he had instructed the U.S. officials who remained in Quebec to oppose the G7 joint statement endorsed by the leaders of Japan, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany and, of course, Canada. \u201cI have instructed our U.S. Reps not to endorse the Communique as we look at Tariffs on automobiles flooding the U.S. Market!\u201d Trump posted on the site then known as Twitter. This time, Trump already has hit several dozen nations with severe tariffs that risk a global economic slowdown. There is little progress on settling the wars in Ukraine and Gaza and now a new and escalating conflict between Israel and Iran over Tehran\u2019s nuclear program. Add to all of that the problems of climate change, immigration, drug trafficking, new technologies such as artificial intelligence and China\u2019s continued manufacturing superiority and chokehold on key supply chains. Asked if he planned to announce any trade agreements at the G7 as he left the White House on Sunday, Trump said: \u201cWe have our trade deals. All we have to do is send a letter, \u2018This is what you\u2019re going to have to pay.\u2019 But I think we\u2019ll have a few, few new trade deals.\u201d At stake might be the survival of the G7 itself at a time when the Trump administration has sent mixed signals about whether the president will attend the November Group of 20 summit in South Africa. What Trump opposed at the 2018 summit in Quebec wasn\u2019t just tariffs, but a focus on having alliances with a shared set of standards seeking to shape policies. \u201cThe big dispute in Quebec were the references to the rules-based international order and that\u2019s where that famous photo comes from,\u201d said Peter Boehm, Canada\u2019s counselor at the 2018 G7 summit in Quebec and a veteran of six G7 summits. \u201cI think it gave everyone the idea that G7s were maybe not business as usual.\u201d The German, U.K., Japanese and Italian governments have each signaled a belief that a friendly relationship with Trump this year can reduce the likelihood of outbursts. \u201cWell, I have got a good relationship with President Trump, and that\u2019s important,\u201d U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Saturday as he flew to Canada. There is no plan for a joint statement this year from the G7, a sign that the Trump administration sees no need to build a shared consensus with fellow democracies if it views such a statement as contrary to its goals of new tariffs, more fossil fuel production and a Europe that is less dependent on the U.S. military. \u201cThe Trump administration almost certainly believes that no deal is better than a bad deal,\u201d said Caitlin Welsh, a director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank who was part of Trump\u2019s team for the G7 in Trump\u2019s first term. The White House has stayed decidedly mum about its goals for the G7, which originated as a 1973 finance ministers\u2019 meeting to address the oil crisis and steadily evolved into a yearly summit that is meant to foster personal relationships among world leaders and address global problems. The G7 even briefly expanded to the G8 with Russia as a member, only for Russia to be expelled in 2014 after annexing Crimea and taking a foothold in Ukraine that preceded its aggressive 2022 invasion of that nation. Trump will have at least three scheduled bilateral meetings during the summit with other world leaders while in Canada, staring on Monday morning with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. The U.S. president is also expected to have bilateral meetings with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, according to an administration official. The U.S. president has imposed 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum and autos, all of which have disproportionately hit Japan. Trump is also charging a 10% tax on imports from most countries, though he could raise rates on July 9, after the 90-day negotiating period set by him would expire. The United Kingdom reached a trade framework with the U.S. that included quotas to protect against some tariffs, but the 10% baseline would remain as the Trump administration is banking on tariff revenues to help cover the cost of its income tax cuts. Canada and Mexico face separate tariffs of as much as 25% that Trump put into place under the auspices of stopping fentanyl smuggling, through some products are still protected under the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement signed during Trump\u2019s first term. The Trump administration has insisted that its broad tariffs will produce trade agreements that box out China, though it\u2019s unclear how antagonizing trade partners would make them want to strengthen their reliance on the U.S. Carney, the Canadian leader, has been outspoken in saying his country can no longer look to the U.S. as an enduring friend. That might leave Trump with the awkward task of wanting to keep his tariffs in place while also trying to convince other countries that they\u2019re better off siding with the U.S. than China. \u201cTrump will try to coordinate the group against China\u2019s economic coercion,\u201d Josh Lipsky, chair of international economics at the Atlantic Council, wrote in an analysis. \u201cBut the rest of the leaders may turn back to Trump and say that this kind of coordination, which is at the heart of why the G7 works, would be easier if he weren\u2019t imposing tariffs on his allies.\u201d Boak reported from Calgary, Alberta.

It is also looking to eliminate the dyes from its full U.S. retail portfolio by the end of 2027.\nKraft Heinz said Tuesday that almost 90% of its U.S. products already don\u2019t contain food, drug & cosmetic colors, but that the products that do still use the dyes will have them removed by the end of 2027. FD&C colors are synthetic additives that are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in food, drugs and cosmetics.\nKraft Heinz said that many of its U.S. products that still use the FD&C colors are in its beverage and desserts categories, including certain products sold under brands including Crystal Light, Kool Aid, Jell-O and Jet Puffed.\nThe company said that it will instead use natural colors for the products.\n\u201cThe vast majority of our products use natural or no colors, and we\u2019ve been on a journey to reduce our use of FD&C colors across the remainder of our portfolio,\u201d Pedro Navio, North America President at Kraft Heinz, said in a statement.\nKraft Heinz stripped artificial colors, flavors and preservatives from its macaroni and cheese in 2016 and said it has never used artificial dyes in its ketchup.\nThe company plans to work with licensees of its brands to encourage them to remove the dyes.\nGeneral Mills said that the changes it is making only impacts a small portion of its K-12 school business as almost all of its school items are already made without artificial dyes. In addition, 85% of the company\u2019s U.S. foods that are sold retail are already made without dyes.\n\u201cAcross the long arc of our history, General Mills has moved quickly to meet evolving consumer needs, and reformulating our product portfolio to remove certified colors is yet another example,\u201d Chairman and CEO Jeff Harmening said in a statement.\nIn April Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference that the agency would take steps to eliminate the synthetic dyes by the end of 2026, largely by relying on voluntary efforts from the food industry.\nHealth advocates have long called for the removal of artificial dyes from foods, citing mixed studies indicating they can cause neurobehavioral problems, including hyperactivity and attention issues, in some children. The FDA has maintained that the approved dyes are safe and that \u201cthe totality of scientific evidence shows that most children have no adverse effects when consuming foods containing color additives.\u201d\nThe FDA currently allows 36 food color additives, including eight synthetic dyes.

Inside fashion's worrying runway trend. Now that the Fall-Winter 2023 catwalks have been disassembled, it\u2019s clear one trend was more pervasive than any collective penchant for ruffles, pleated skirts or tailored coats.\nAcross runways in New York, London, Milan and Paris, there was a notable scarcity of plus-size models. This comes at a time when there are five injectable medications which can be used as appetite suppressants currently available by prescription in the US, stirring much conversation; a sixth medication, Rybelsus, is taken as an oral pill. Two are officially approved in the UK \u2014 the largest influx of weight loss medication seen in the country in almost a decade.\nIn recent months, injectables such as Wegovy and Ozempic \u2014 which share the same active ingredient, semaglutide \u2014 have been widely reported as Hollywood\u2019s worst-kept weight loss secret. (Ozempic is intended for use primarily to treat Type 2 diabetes.) Comedian Chelsea Handler claimed her \u201canti-aging doctor just hands (Ozempic) out to anybody\u201d while appearing on a podcast in January. Even Elon Musk tweeted last year about being on Wegovy.\nFor many fashion commentators and diversity advocates, the Fall-Winter 2023 runways were in sharp contrast to the (albeit limited) progress and heady promise of recent seasons. This rollback has been widely criticized in the style media as such. And its potential impact is being assessed more broadly: With the rise of these weight loss panaceas, the pursuit of size zero is now just a prescription away.\nThe Fall-Winter failings\nIn 2020, Jill Kortleve and Paloma Elsesser became the first models outside of a sample size to walk for the Italian fashion house Fendi. (Traditionally, a sample size falls between a US 0-4.) British label Erdem entered the plus-size market in 2021, extending its offering to a UK size 22 (or US size 18). And in January 2022, Valentino made headlines after its haute couture show featured a broad spectrum of body types. But this season, there was a visible lack of curve bodies on their runways \u2014 or many others.\nFendi and Valentino did not respond when contacted by CNN, while Erdem declined to comment.\nAccording to fashion search engine Tagwalk, the number of mid and plus-size models dropped by 24% in comparison to Spring-Summer 2023. Similarly, a size inclusivity report conducted by Vogue Business found that 95.6% of all looks presented for Fall-Winter 2023 were in a size US 0-4. For context, industry market firm Plunkett Research estimated in 2015 that 68% of American women wear a size US 14 or above.\n\u201cIt was a definitive backslide,\u201d said IMG model agent Mina White, who represents plus-size and curve supermodels including Elsesser and Ashley Graham. \u201cIt was frustrating to see some of these designers not using curved bodies where they had in the past.\u201d Fendi and Valentino did not respond when contacted by CNN, while Erdem declined to comment.\n\u201cWatching somebody like Ashley Graham attend the front row for so many of these major houses in full looks (provided by the designer), it was frustrating,\u201d White continued. \u201cThey wanted to utilize her image and her social following to command a certain space in the market, but they didn\u2019t want to be reflective on their runways.\u201d\nFor others, even the term \u201cbackslide\u201d was too generous. \u201cSlipping back from\u2026 what? A glorious time when the average American woman (size 16) was as present on the runways as she is in everyday life? A time when fashion ads cast as many \u2018plus-size\u2019 and \u2018mid-size\u2019 women as \u2018straight-size\u2019 women?\u201d fashion journalist Amy Odell wrote in her Substack newsletter of this past season\u2019s runways. \u201cNo one needed any data to understand that representing a wide array of body shapes and sizes in runway shows or in fashion imagery is not a priority for the industry.\u201d\nThat said, a handful of \u2014 mostly smaller \u2014 brands pushed ahead this season. In London, emerging labels Di Petsa, Karoline Vitto and Sinead O\u2019Dwyer showcased lineups of size-diverse models. Inclusivity at Christian Siriano, Coach, Kim Shui, Collina Strada and Bach Mai stood out in New York; while in Paris, Belgian brand Esther Manas \u2014 a consistent flag-bearer for size diversity \u2014 staged one of the city\u2019s most refreshing runways with an assortment of fun, sensual, feminine looks that complimented a range of bodies.\nThere was also a smattering of mid- and plus-size castings to be seen elsewhere: Off-White and Michael Kors, for example, featured a few such models. At Harris Reed\u2019s debut for Nina Ricci, Precious Lee opened the show \u2014 which also featured three more plus- and mid-size models.\nIt starts with sample size\nFashion samples and sample size pieces are one-off garments made before an item is mass-produced, typically to be worn during runway shows. Prioritizing the same body type in sample sizes means runway models are more easily interchangeable, saving fashion houses time and money if someone were to drop out or get sick during or after the casting process for a show.\nIt\u2019s also partly why, according to White, casting curve models is still an uphill battle. She says she introduces brands to new faces months in advance of runway season, with their specific measurements up-top and easy to read in all correspondence. \u201cI want to be ahead of that,\u201d White said. \u201cSo I\u2019m never told \u2018Oh, we wanted to make it work, but we didn\u2019t have her size\u2019 or whatever that conversation might look like.\u201d\nBut despite her efforts, she says she\u2019s frequently told it\u2019s too much of a \u201cfinancial lift\u201d to make larger samples \u2014 even by legacy brands. \u201cI get very upset when brands say that,\u201d White said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that it is, I believe that it\u2019s people not being properly educated on how to do this right.\u201d\nBeyond the lack of representation, White notes it\u2019s painful for plus-size consumers to watch brands leverage resources to create custom, made-to-fit pieces for celebrities \u2014 all the while claiming the pot is empty for more inclusive runway samples.\nLondon-based stylist and editor Francesca Burns agrees sample sizes are part of the problem. In 2020, Burns went viral after she posted on Instagram about a fashion job gone wrong. She says she was sent five looks to style from Celine, none of which fit the size UK 8 (US 4) model booked for the shoot\u2014 an 18-year-old on her first job in the business. The experience left her \u201chorrified,\u201d Burns told CNN, recalling what she saw as the model\u2019s shame and embarrassment. \u201cLooking into this girl\u2019s eyes,\u201d Burns said, \u201cshe shouldn\u2019t have felt like that.\u201d\nBurns\u2019 post, which called the current system \u201cunacceptable,\u201d was picked up widely in the fashion media. (When reached by CNN, Celine declined to comment on the incident.) \u201cUltimately, the desire to see change has to be there,\u201d Burns said. \u201cAnd I wonder whether luxury has that desire?\u201d\nA case for change\nProgress has been slow, but not entirely inexistent. Across fashion campaigns, magazine covers and editorial shoots, there is a growing enthusiasm for inclusivity. \u201cI see the options rolling in for the plus-sized talent, and they\u2019re great offerings,\u201d said White. \u201cGreat, strong editorials and covers and campaigns. But I do feel like without the clothes, we are going to go back to see more naked curve stories, or lingerie curve stories or a curve girl in a trench coat. That\u2019s what I don\u2019t want.\u201d\nFor British Vogue\u2019s April issue, unveiled March 16, Elsesser, Lee and Jill Kortleve were dubbed \u201cThe New Supers.\u201d Preceding the cover story is a letter written by editor-in-chief, Edward Enninful commending the models for \u201cleading the way\u201d and holding \u201cpowerful space\u201d in the industry.\n\u201cCatwalks are once again under scrutiny for a stark lack of body diversity,\u201d read the magazine\u2019s Instagram caption, unveiling the cover. \u201cBut this cover was not conceived as a statement. It is a crowning of an all-powerful trio, the supermodels for a new generation.\u201d\nBut many online were quick to point out the disconnect: Two of the Saint Laurent Spring-Summer 2023 dresses were modeled by plus-size women, though they are not available to buy in most plus sizes.\nIn his own social media post, Enninful wrote about his disappointment at the Fall-Winter 2023 runways. \u201cI thought I had gotten into a time machine. Show after show dominated by one body type, so many limited visions of womanhood\u2026 one prescribed notion of beauty prevailed again, and it felt like the reality of so many women around the world were being ignored.\u201d\nBut for White, the power rests within the entire industry \u2014 not just at the feet of brands. \u201cI really do believe there should be an industry standard between the (Council of Fashion Designers of America), the British Fashion Council and key editors at some of these major mass market magazines,\u201d she continued. \u201cIf there was a call-to-action from these figureheads saying, moving forward samples need to be readily available for a few different body types, we would see significant and impactful change.\u201d\nBurns agrees there must be a trickle-down effect. \u201cI think a lot of responsibility is put on young designers to solve all these issues around sustainability or issues around body inclusivity,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that the big powerhouses, which have the capacity to action change, really take some responsibility.\u201d\n\u2018No such thing as a free lunch\u2019\nOn March 8, Wegovy \u2014 developed primarily as a treatment for those living with obesity and weight-related conditions \u2014 was approved in the UK. It\u2019s the second injectable weight management medication to be made available with a prescription via the country\u2019s National Health Service (NHS) in about 3 years, after almost a decade of quiet. Before 2020, the last weight loss medication was approved in the UK was in 2010.\nSimilarly, the US has now approved three weight management injections: Wegovy, Saxenda and IMCIVREE. Medications for type-2 diabetes like Mounjaro and Ozempic are not FDA-approved for weight loss, though some doctors are issuing them at their own discretion.\nWhile these medicines are a revolutionary tool for those who struggle to lose weight for genetic or medical reasons, they are at risk of being abused.\nSemaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic, was originally developed for treating type-2 diabetes. It quells hunger signals to the brain by mimicking the hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). \u201cIt can slow how quickly your stomach empties out and may give you a little more feeling of feeling full,\u201d said Dr. Robert Lash, an endocrinologist and Chief Medical Officer of the Endocrine Society in Washington, D.C. In clinical trials, over a period of 68 weeks, participants who used the medication in conjunction with eating fewer calories and increasing their physical activity on average lost around 15% of their body weight compared to 2.4% of those using a placebo, according to the manufacturer Novo Nordisk.\nOn March 13, the European Medicines Agency issued a statement warning of an Ozempic shortage that could continue through the year, urging doctors to prioritize prescriptions to diabetics. \u201cAny other use, including for weight management, represents off-label use and currently places the availability of Ozempic for the indicated population at risk,\u201d read the release.\nPatients typically need a BMI of 27 or higher (along with another weight-related condition like high blood pressure or diabetes) or have a genetic predisposition towards obesity to be prescribed such appetite suppressant medication by their doctor. But talk of these injectables has been sweeping the West. In January, the New York Times reported on the term \u201cOzempic Face,\u201d coined by a New York-based dermatologist who reported treating several patients with a hollowed-out appearance that can come with rapid weight loss. By the end of February, the medication had made it to the cover of New York Magazine in a feature titled \u201cLife After Food?\u201d Adverts for GLP-1 injections are even blanketing New York City subway stations.\nAnd across social media, online forums and private group chats, some people looking to lose weight for primarily aesthetic purposes are searching for a way to skirt the requirements.\n\u201cI was just looking for a way to lose a few pounds, like 10 to 15 at most,\u201d said one 30-year-old American woman, who wished to remain anonymous, in a phone interview. She scoured social media and forums for guidance on securing a weight loss drug. \u201cI\u2019m certainly a normal BMI, I just have a trip to Mexico coming up and I want to look really good,\u201d she said.\nAlthough she says she found a way to access Wegovy, she decided against the medication after considering the cost (which can reach more than $1,000 a month without insurance). \u201cI\u2019ve always very much fit the societal standard but lately I was just like f*ck it, I want to be skinny,\u201d she told CNN.\nDr. Lash emphasized the importance of taking weight loss drugs only with medical supervision and a valid prescription. \u201cIf somebody was a normal weight and they took this drug because they thought they could be even thinner than they are now, that could lead to complications,\u201d he told CNN, warning of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and even gallbladder problems. \u201cThese drugs are not benign, they do have side effects involving the GI tract. There\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch.\u201d\nEvery body is invited\nFashion has long promoted size 0 as the ultimate virtue \u2014 regardless of its viability for many people, or any health risks. And now with the accessibility of accelerated weight loss medication, the stakes are even higher. For Burns and White, the industry is responsible for amplifying a new, more inclusive vision of beauty.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a very archaic way of looking at women over a size 16 and just assuming that they\u2019re unhealthy or uneducated or unstylish. Or don\u2019t have the resources to buy into luxury,\u201d said White. \u201cThe reality is the same women these brands are alienating in their fashion space are the same women running out to buy their handbags, shoes, perfumes, cosmetics and skincare.\u201d\nNot only do designers need to create clothes with this consumer in mind, according to White, but they need to be seen on the runway, too.\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be a conversation. It should just be normalized that we\u2019re not just looking at a single view of beauty,\u201d echoed Burns.\nEster Manas and Balthazar Delepierre, whose bridal-inspired Fall-Winter 2023 collection was one of this season\u2019s most size-diverse runways, summarized it best in their accompanying show notes: \u201cThe body is not the subject. Because, obviously, at a wedding, everybody is invited. And all to the party. That is where the designer duo Ester and Balthazar take their stand.\u201d", "FDA Approved Hundreds of Drugs Without Evidence They Work. Many Are Dangerous.. Nieraj Jain was puzzled by the patient sitting quietly in front of him. The woman, in her 60s, was losing her eyesight; that much was clear. Her vision was blurred, and she was having increasing difficulty seeing at night and in bright sunlight. Less obvious was the cause. A retinal specialist and surgeon at Emory University in Georgia, Jain pored over specialized scans of her eye and saw odd patches of pigment on her retina \u2014 patches that didn\u2019t fit with any known diagnosis.\nA fleeting memory pulled him up short; hadn\u2019t he seen another patient a few months before with a similar finding? Combing through patient records, Jain dug up five more patients at Emory with the same puzzling retinal changes. All were going blind \u2014 and all happened to be taking Elmiron, a drug for a bladder condition called interstitial cystitis. In 2018, Jain and his colleagues published their findings about this new cause of blindness, dubbing it \u201cpigmentary maculopathy.\u201d\nMeanwhile, gastroenterologists at Emory and other institutions were uncovering another troubling finding about Elmiron: Some patients on the drug were being diagnosed with colitis, a chronic inflammatory bowel disease with potentially life-threatening complications.\nAccording to a government database analyzed by The Lever and the McGraw Center for Business Journalism at CUNY\u2019s Newmark Graduate School of Journalism, by the end of 2024, hundreds of patients on Elmiron had suffered vision loss or blindness. Others taking the drug were even more unlucky. Dozens of patient deaths associated with Elmiron were reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and 45 patients were hospitalized with severe colitis.\nAnother problem? There\u2019s no good evidence that Elmiron works.\nWhen the government approved Elmiron in 1996, the manufacturer provided close to zero data that the drug effectively treated interstitial cystitis. Regulators allowed Elmiron on the market only on the proviso that the company conduct a second study to determine if it worked. It would take 18 years for the various companies that bought and sold the drug\u2019s license to produce that study \u2014 and it proved to be a resounding bust. Patients who took Elmiron did no better than those given a sugar pill. (Janssen, which manufactures Elmiron, did not respond to repeated requests for comment.)\nAll of which raises a question: How could a drug with such serious side effects get on the market in the first place? And how could it stay on the market for nearly three decades, even after subsequent studies failed to show it was effective? The answer to both questions strikes at the heart of what ails the FDA today.\nElmiron is just one of hundreds of drugs that have been approved by the FDA over the last several decades on the basis of flimsy or nonexistent evidence. Drug companies have been allowed to market hundreds of prescription drugs to doctors and sell them to unsuspecting patients despite glaringly inadequate evidence that they offer any benefit and in many cases amid clear signs that they pose a risk of serious, often irreparable harm.\nFrom January 2013 until Dec. 31, 2022, the FDA approved 429 drugs, most of which were authorized on the basis of inadequate evidence that they worked, according to a database of government records created for this investigation. Based on an analysis of these records, the agency has allowed dozens of treatments, like Elmiron, to remain on the market even when subsequent studies failed to show they are effective. This investigation found that from 2013 through 2022:\n- Seventy-three percent of drugs approved by the FDA did not meet the agency\u2019s four foundational standards required to show they work as expected.\n- More than half of drug approvals were based on preliminary data rather than sound evidence that patients had fewer symptoms, improved function, or lived longer.\n- Fifty-five of the 429 drugs approved met only one of the four standards needed to show that a drug is safe and effective; 39 drugs met none of them.\nMany of the issues with drug approvals uncovered in this investigation are particularly concerning with regard to cancer treatments.\n- Only 2.4 percent of the 123 cancer drugs approved from 2013 through 2022 met all four of the FDA\u2019s scientific criteria. Twenty-nine drugs \u2014 23 percent \u2014 met none.\n- Eighty-one percent of cancer drugs were approved based on preliminary evidence rather than data showing patients would live longer. Studies of cancer drugs approved on preliminary evidence have failed to show they improve survival in the vast majority of cases.\nThese statistics come after billions of dollars and years of lobbying by the pharmaceutical industry and patient advocacy groups pressuring Congress to loosen the FDA\u2019s scientific standards.\nThe resulting seismic shift from proving drugs work before they are approved to showing they work only after approval \u2014 if ever \u2014 has been quietly accomplished with virtually no awareness by doctors or the public. Insurers and taxpayers effectively pay for research after drugs hit the market as pharmaceutical companies reap the profits. Patients serve as the unwitting guinea pigs \u2014 with very real consequences.\nIn the U.S. alone, an estimated 128,000 people are killed each year by side effects of prescription drugs that are properly prescribed. That number excludes opioid overdoses and is more than deaths from all illegal drugs combined. And the rate at which the agency approves unproven drugs has accelerated dramatically in the last 10 years.\nThese are just some of the findings of a two-year investigation by The Lever and the McGraw Center into all 429 new drugs approved from 2013 through 2022. A team of four experts, three of whom are physicians and one a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard, evaluated the scientific studies cited by the agency in its approval decisions.\nIn addition, the authors used government reports, internal FDA documents, investigators\u2019 notes, congressional testimony, court records, and interviews with more than 100 researchers, legal scholars, current and former federal officials, patients, and their families.\nA 14-member advisory committee including physicians, epidemiologists, biostatisticians, a patient advocate, an FDA insider, and an FDA advisor provided guidance for the investigation. Several of the advisers vetted the findings for accuracy.\nThese experts were shocked by some of this investigation\u2019s findings.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been discouraged about the FDA before, but the last few years have been the worst,\u201d said one of those advisers, Diana Zuckerman, founder and president of the Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit National Center for Health Research. \u201cThe scientific bar is often so low it would be impossible to lower it much further.\u201d\nExamining the nation\u2019s drug approval process has gained urgency in the wake of President Donald Trump\u2019s executive orders demanding federal agencies deregulate numerous industries. And while Martin Makary, Trump\u2019s pick for FDA commissioner, has written widely about medical error and the need for more rigorous medical science, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. is known for his unsupported claims about medicines and vaccines.\nExperts say the current political reality doesn\u2019t bode well for a drug-approval process that\u2019s already plagued by deficiencies.\n\u201cWe need an agency that\u2019s independent from the industry it regulates and that uses high quality science to assess the safety and efficacy of new drugs,\u201d says Reshma Ramachandran, a co-director of the Yale Collaboration for Regulatory Rigor, Integrity, and Transparency and an expert in analyzing clinical trials, \u201cWithout that, we might as well go back to the days of snake oil and patent medicines.\u201d\n\u201cWe Opened Pandora\u2019s Box\u201d\nBetween drugs, food, dietary supplements, tobacco, and medical devices, the FDA regulates $3.9 trillion worth of products each year, roughly one-eighth of the entire U.S. economy. With a budget of approximately $6.9 billion in 2024, hundreds of offices in the U.S. and abroad, and more than 19,000 full-time employees (prior to recent firings), the FDA\u2019s resources and scope make it one of the most powerful agencies in the country and highly influential around the world.\nIts reputation was built on hard-won scientific standards put into place by Congress in 1938 and 1962 after a string of medical tragedies. These new laws, sometimes called \u201csuper-statutes\u201d because they are so far-reaching, authorized the agency to require drug companies to provide evidence that their drugs are safe and effective before they could go on the market.\nThen came AIDS. By 1988, the epidemic was in full swing: 46,000 people had died, and another 37,000 were living in the U.S. with the poorly understood condition. AIDS activist groups wanted access to new drugs \u2014 and fast. With news cameras rolling, activists blockaded the entrance to FDA headquarters in Rockville, Maryland, holding placards saying \u201cFederal Death Administration,\u201d and lying on the street holding cardboard tombstones that read \u201cKilled by the FDA.\u201d\nActivists found ready partners in drugmakers, who were eager to get their products to market. Together, the activists and companies argued before the FDA that the compassionate, lifesaving strategy would be to loosen scientific standards for establishing the efficacy of drugs.\nAmong those existing standards was the strong recommendation that companies submit two or more randomized, controlled clinical trials that show a drug is effective in order to win approval. That\u2019s because any single study, no matter how well it\u2019s conducted, will often yield results that can happen by chance alone and do not stand up to later scrutiny.\nBut these trials can be expensive and time-consuming to conduct and analyze. Between that and a shortage of FDA reviewers, new treatments for AIDS were flowing through the chronically underfunded agency at the speed of chilled molasses. It took an average of seven to twelve years to take a drug through the development pipeline, three of which could be taken up while a company\u2019s data sat on an FDA reviewer\u2019s desk.\nUnder pressure from patient groups and drugmakers, the FDA created an \u201caccelerated pathway\u201d in 1992, which allowed companies to provide preliminary evidence that their AIDS drugs were effective. The new rules let these companies conduct trials tracking unreliable patient outcomes known as \u201csurrogates,\u201d with the expectation that drugmakers would provide more substantive evidence of real patient benefit after the drugs were on the market.\nSurrogate outcomes are laboratory tests, or imaging studies like CT scans, that don\u2019t themselves track quality or quantity of life, but are hypothesized to be reasonably likely to predict a so-called \u201cclinical benefit.\u201d Clinical outcomes are the ones that matter to patients, like feeling better and living longer, but relying on surrogate outcomes means that drug companies could gain approval based on shorter and cheaper studies.\nThe problem is that improvements in a surrogate outcome often fail to correlate with whether a drug actually improves patients\u2019 lives. In addition, a surrogate outcome can\u2019t reflect the harm that a drug can cause, a limitation that has been repeatedly confirmed.\nSome external experts therefore expressed concern about approving drugs based on surrogate outcomes \u2014 and those worries were borne out by the AIDS drug AZT.\nWhen AZT was approved in 1987, many expected it to be a raging success based on research that counted T-cells, disease-fighting cells that the AIDS virus attacks, and other studies that tracked early survival data. But less than two years later, researchers at the Claude Bernard Hospital in Paris published their findings on 365 AIDS patients treated with AZT, concluding the results were \u201cdisappointing.\u201d The drug was toxic to blood cells, and after six months, patients \u201creturned to their pretreatment levels [of T-cells] and several opportunistic infections, malignancies, and deaths occurred.\u2019\u2019 (AZT would prove beneficial in later years when used in lower doses as part of a triple cocktail of AIDS drugs.)\nStill, the pharmaceutical industry actively promoted the treatment. With a list price of $21,000 a year per patient in 2025 dollars, AZT delivered $2 billion in profits to its drugmaker Burroughs Wellcome in 1989. Seeing the rewards to be reaped, companies began lobbying Congress to force the FDA to apply the looser AIDS standards to all sorts of drugs.\nBig Pharma\u2019s campaign contributions jumped from $1.9 million in 1990 to $3.6 million in 1992, according to the Federal Election Committee and OpenSecrets, an independent research group. That year, Congress passed the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, which explicitly directed the FDA to allow approvals based on lower standards.\nRep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) slammed the legislation, saying that while it \u201csounds good\u2026 it is a hoax to imply that it will do more than the FDA is already doing to bring effective AIDS drugs to the market.\u201d\nThe act also required drug companies to pay \u201cuser fees,\u201d which the agency used to hire nearly 600 new staff. But critics say such fees have led some senior agency officials to view the industry as \u201cpartners.\u201d The agency would go on to launch multiple \u201cpublic-private partnerships\u201d with the companies it is tasked with regulating.\nSubsequent laws directed the FDA to expedite drug approvals by further lowering standards of evidence.\n\u201cWe opened Pandora\u2019s Box, and Pharma exploited it,\u201d says Gregg Gonsalves, an AIDS activist and professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health. In 1993, he told an FDA advisory committee that with the best of intentions, and in the face of a terrifying health crisis, AIDS activists had helped \u201cunleash drugs with well-documented toxicities onto the market, without obtaining rigorous data on their clinical efficacy.\u201d\nThe result, said Gonsalves, is \u201cwe\u2019ve arrived in hell.\u201d\nThe Missing Evidence\nToday, hundreds of drugs intended to treat a wide range of diseases have been approved by the FDA without critical evidence demonstrating they work.\nAccording to the database created for this investigation, nearly three-quarters \u2014 311 \u2014 of the 429 drugs approved from 2013 through 2022 were put on the market despite inadequate evidence of their efficacy.\nThis analysis was based on the four essential criteria cited in the FDA\u2019s own standards and case law for assessing whether drugs work and are safe:\n- Control group: Patients taking the drug were compared to a control group that was given a placebo or a comparator drug.\n- Replication: At least two \u201cwell-controlled\u201d trials showed the drug was effective.\n- Blinding: Subjects in the studies and the doctors who cared for them don\u2019t know which patients are on the drug and which are in the control group.\n- Clinical endpoint: The studies measured the drug\u2019s effect on patients\u2019 survival or function rather than a surrogate measure.\nThese criteria are by no means a complete list of sound scientific evidence. Instead, they comprise the minimum criteria needed to determine whether drugmakers have provided \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d to support claims of effectiveness for new drugs.\nYet only 118 of the 429 drugs approved over that period, a mere 28 percent, met the four criteria. One hundred and twenty-three drugs (29 percent) met three of the criteria, while 39 drugs, more than 9 percent of the total, failed to meet a single criterion. That doesn\u2019t mean these drugs don\u2019t work, but it does mean the FDA approved them without knowing whether they are more likely to help patients than hurt them.\nMore than a quarter of the drugs approved over the study period, 123, were for various forms of cancer. This might seem like good news for the war on cancer, but only three of those drugs met all four of the minimum criteria, and 29 cancer drugs failed to meet a single criterion. In other words, one in four cancer drugs were approved based on studies with no comparison group, no blinding, no replication, and no clinical outcome.\nThe most common way drug companies get such cancer drugs approved is by using a surrogate outcome in their clinical trials, rather than measuring actual clinical benefit. Drug companies routinely study laboratory measures like how much a tumor shrinks in response to a drug, instead of mortality or symptom relief.\nBut experts say the FDA should have no illusions regarding the unreliability of such surrogate outcomes, especially since these outcomes fail to take into account the harms a drug may cause, such as liver failure and anemia. These criticisms were hammered home after the agency approved Avastin to treat metastatic breast cancer.\nOriginally approved for two other types of cancers, Avastin hit the market for breast cancer in 2008. At that time, women with metastatic breast cancer faced a dire prognosis: Most would be dead within five years, even after multiple rounds of chemotherapy drugs. Avastin was hailed as a breakthrough because it doesn\u2019t kill cancer cells the way chemotherapy does but instead inhibits the growth of blood vessels, which tumors need to grow.\nAvastin was approved based on a surrogate outcome called \u201cprogression-free survival,\u201d which doesn\u2019t actually look at patient survival but instead measures how long a cancer drug keeps a tumor in check. But just because a tumor isn\u2019t growing or even shrinks doesn\u2019t mean the patient will live longer or enjoy a better quality of life.\nIn 2010, worldwide Avastin sales had hit $6.8 billion. The approval for breast cancer had come with the condition that the manufacturer, Genentech, conduct another study to determine whether the drug actually worked. Two years later, the company produced two studies that suggested the opposite: the drug did not help people live longer.\nIn total, the company had conducted five clinical trials, none of which demonstrated that Avastin helped breast cancer patients live longer or with less disability. The new studies also documented the drug\u2019s more serious side effects, which included blood clots, perforated intestines, stroke, heart problems, and kidney malfunction. Genentech did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\nBut when the FDA proposed withdrawing approval for Avastin for breast cancer, Genentech and several patient advocacy groups fought back, sometimes viciously. At a two-day public hearing in 2011, one of the few patient advocates testifying in favor of the FDA\u2019s decision came with a bodyguard after being threatened verbally by others who supported Avastin. FDA staff received violent threats, and police were posted outside the building.\nThe FDA ultimately withdrew its approval of Avastin for breast cancer, but the episode, still referred to as \u201cArmageddon\u201d by some staff, had a chilling effect. The agency would not demand another drug withdrawal in the face of company opposition for more than two decades.\nToday, progression-free survival, along with a half-dozen other surrogate outcomes, has become the norm for approving cancer drugs. This investigation found that 81 percent of the 123 cancer drugs approved from 2013 through 2022 were based on studies that did not track overall survival and instead reported on progression-free survival or another surrogate.\nSuch approvals have real consequences for patients. Take Copiktra, a cancer drug manufactured by Secura Bio Inc. that was approved by the FDA in 2018 based on improved progression-free survival and other surrogate outcomes. According to a Lever review of FDA records, two-thirds of leukemia and lymphoma patients taking the drug developed serious complications. Patients treated with Copiktra also died 11 months earlier than patients treated with the comparator drug.\nIn December 2021, the manufacturer announced it would stop marketing the drug for follicular lymphoma. Six months later, the FDA issued a warning about \u201cpossible increased risk of death and serious side effects.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t until July 2024 \u2014 six years after studies showed the drug cut months off the lives of patients \u2014 that the FDA announced that Copitra should not be used as first- or second-line treatment for certain types of leukemia and lymphoma \u201cdue to an increased risk of treatment-related mortality.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Copiktra\u2019s manufacturer, Secura Bio, told The Lever that in May 2022, the company sent a \u201cDear Healthcare Professional\u201d letter to physicians about the results of the post-market studies \u201cin accordance with FDA requirements.\u201d The company said Copiktra can still be prescribed for certain conditions if two other drug treatments have failed.\nCopiktra is hardly an exception. According to a 2015 study, only 14 percent of cancer drugs approved based on a surrogate outcome, such as progression-free survival, between 2008 and 2012 were later shown to improve real-world survival. In other words, 86 percent were not supported by evidence that they helped patients live longer. What the drugs did cause were numerous serious side effects, while costing patients, taxpayers, and insurers billions of dollars a year.\nAnother, more recent study found that between January 2006 and December 2023, 147 cancer drugs that had been approved on a surrogate outcome were later tested to determine if they improved overall survival. Approximately three-quarters failed to do so.\nEven when cancer drugs do improve survival, the gains can be meager. A 2022 study by researchers at the National Cancer Institute found that the median survival time for 124 cancer medicines approved from 2003 through 2021 to treat solid tumors was just 2.8 months. The average cost of such drugs is more than $24,000 per month.\nIn other words, after patients and their families spend financially crippling sums and go through side effects ranging from nausea to death, their outcomes are hardly better \u2014 and could be worse \u2014 than no treatment at all.\nThat outcome is not what most cancer patients expect when their doctor writes a prescription. It\u2019s also at odds with what doctors believe about the meaning of FDA drug approvals. In 2016, researchers published the results of a survey sent to physicians that included the following question: \u201cFor [the] FDA to approve a drug, must the studies show: a.) a clinically important result; b.) a statistically significant result; c.) both; d.) None of the above.\u201d The correct answer was none of the above.\nOnly 6 percent of doctors got the answer right. Aaron Kesselheim, a researcher at Harvard Medical School and co-author of the report, said the result was \u201cdisappointing, but not entirely surprising. Doctors aren\u2019t taught about the approval process.\u201d\nWhen the Science Never Comes\nNothing about ProAmatine would suggest it would ever get on the market.\nThis investigation found that between 1990 and 1996, the FDA rejected the blood pressure drug four times. The agency told the company, Roberts Pharmaceutical, that its studies showing ProAmatine could treat low blood pressure when a patient stands up were \u201cpoorly conducted.\u201d Nor were the \u201cincremental\u201d increases in blood pressure sufficient proof of benefit since they were surrogate measures, according to the agency, which wanted evidence that patients would feel or function better. The agency instructed the company to conduct randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies.\nBefore the agency rejected the drug for the fourth time, in March 1996, FDA medical reviewer Maryann Gordon noted a striking incidence of severe high blood pressure among treated patients. She suggested that this side effect might account for at least some of the strokes, heart attacks, and congestive heart failure that had occurred among patients on ProAmatine. She concluded, \u201c\u2026the mostly unexplored benefits of midodrine do not outweigh its real risks, thus making midodrine [ProAmatine] not approvable.\u201d\nBut less than three months after the FDA\u2019s fourth rejection of ProAmatine, the agency reversed course, saying that following a meeting with the company, it had \u201creconsidered\u201d its prior rejection and would approve ProAmatine after all, under \u201c21 Code of Federal Regulations Subpart H,\u201d a provision in the regulations that the FDA interprets as giving the agency \u201cflexibility\u201d in its approval decisions.\nOne FDA insider who asked to remain anonymous told The Lever, \u201cSubpart H was never meant to rescue failed drug development programs after trials had already failed to show direct benefit to patients.\u201d Instead, the provision was designed to allow the agency leeway in approving drugs that looked highly promising for life-threatening conditions for which there were few or no other treatments.\nWhile the condition treated by ProAmatine is not life-threatening, Roberts Pharmaceutical was able to use the regulation to get the drug on the market in 1996, agreeing to submit a follow-up study no later than 2000 to determine if the drug worked.\nThe year 2000 came and went. No study. In 2003, the drug patent expired. Still no study. The FDA tried to induce the company to conduct the promised post-market study by granting a three-year patent exclusivity extension, allowing the company to maintain a monopoly on the drug and keep its prices high. In 2005, the company submitted two studies, but the FDA found them insufficient.\nIn 2013, researchers at the Mayo Clinic conducted a comprehensive review of all studies of the drug and found ProAmatine provided \u201cno significant benefit\u201d in blood pressure change on standing up. The drug also caused a higher incidence of adverse events, and the researchers concluded \u201cthere is insufficient and low-quality evidence\u201d to support its use.\nYet, the drug was allowed to remain on the market with no caution issued to patients or doctors until 2017. As of 2009, it had generated $257 million in sales; in 2023, the midodrine market was estimated to be $745 million. Twenty-nine years after the drug was approved, there is still no evidence that it works. The drug is no longer made by Roberts, and three generic manufacturers who make it did not respond to requests for comment.\n\u201cI think rightly or wrongly, FDA managers have decided that completely bending their standards could still lead to good drugs,\u201d says Matthew Herder, a legal scholar at the University of Dalhousie in Halifax, Canada. \u201cThey put a lot of faith in post-market evidence.\u201d But the history of ProAmatine demonstrates that once a drug has been approved on an expedited basis, a requirement for post-market evidence can have little meaning.\nAccording to a 2022 analysis by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, more than one-third of drugs approved on an accelerated pathway have never seen a confirmatory trial. When they did conduct the studies, regulators found companies took anywhere from a few months to 12 years to do so. This investigation found that confirmatory trials can take even longer \u2014 up to 30 years \u2014 and may not be performed at all.\nProAmatine, no longer sold under its brand name, is currently manufactured by multiple companies under the generic name midodrine. Three generic manufacturers of midodrine failed to respond to requests for comment.\nEven when post-market studies are submitted, they often provide no new information. Bishal Gyawali, an oncologist and associate professor at Queen\u2019s University in Kingston, Canada, and two Harvard colleagues looked at cancer drugs approved based on surrogate outcomes between December 1992 and May 2017. Twenty percent of the time, the company submitted a follow-up study that looked at the same surrogate it used to get the drug approved \u2014 even though the point of the additional study was to determine whether the drug offered an actual clinical benefit. In another 21 percent, the follow-up trial used a different surrogate endpoint, rather than clinical outcomes.\nSuch scenarios are so common that the agency has created a term, \u201cdangling approvals,\u201d for the status of drugs whose post-market trials failed or weren\u2019t conducted before their deadline. As of 2021, the FDA had allowed 10 of 35 cancer treatments to remain on the market even after their follow-up studies failed. The manufacturers eventually withdrew eight of the 10 treatments, but only after patients received ineffective treatments for years and companies reaped healthy financial rewards.\nAmong the drugs with dangling approvals was one that had generated controversy before: Avastin, the failed breast cancer drug. Avastin has been shown to improve survival for some cancers, and in 2009, the FDA authorized the drug for recurrent glioblastoma, a fatal brain cancer, based on progression-free survival. In 2017, after the requisite \u201cconfirmatory\u201d trials, the agency granted it full approval \u2014 even though the follow-up studies failed to show it helped patients live any longer.\nAvastin remains on the market for recurrent glioblastoma \u2014 at a cost of $153,000 per year. European regulators refused to approve the drug for that use, citing concerns about safety and efficacy. A spokesperson for Genentech said some patients could benefit, noting that eleven percent of patients were able to discontinue treatment with steroids.\nThen there\u2019s Keytruda, which is widely advertised on TV for a number of cancers. Granted expedited approval in 2017 to treat a certain type of gastric cancer, the drug subsequently failed its post-market study. Keytruda was sold for this use for nearly four years before regulators withdrew its approval in 2021. It remains on the market for other cancers. Merck did not respond to requests for comment.\nWhile drug companies profit from the sales of unproven drugs, everyone else \u2014 patients, insurers, and the government \u2014 pays a heavy price. In just four years, from 2018 through 2021, the taxpayer-funded health insurance programs Medicare and Medicaid shelled out $18 billion for drugs approved on the condition that their manufacturers produce confirmatory trials that had yet to be delivered.\n\u201cEverybody from the [FDA] commissioner on down keeps telling us that approving these marginal drugs will lead to an accumulation of benefits to patients over time, but if a drug doesn\u2019t work, it doesn\u2019t work, and putting them all together doesn\u2019t add up to an effective treatment,\u201d says Fran Visco, a breast cancer survivor and president and cofounder of the National Breast Cancer Coalition. \u201cThe entire medical oncology treatment world is built on a shaky foundation of limited evidence and uncertain patient benefit, but rather than admit that, we keep tweaking it and building on top of it. And it\u2019s not just that you are giving people things that don\u2019t work, these drugs will harm them, and they are financially toxic.\u201d\nA Treatment World Built On Nothing\nIn defending dangling approvals, Richard Pazdur, a physician and the head of the cancer drug division at the FDA, wrote in 2021 that when a drug fails in a clinical trial, it \u201cdoes not necessarily mean that the drug is ineffective.\u201d In one sense, Pazdur is right. Not having convincing evidence that a drug works is not the same as knowing it does not work.\nWhat the scenario does mean is no one knows if it works or not.This investigation\u2019s database shows that hundreds of drugs are now being put on the market before anybody knows if they\u2019re effective.\nIn the past, having a promising surrogate endpoint was used by drug companies to decide whether proceeding to a clinical trial was worth the investment. Now, drugs are put on the market, sold to thousands if not millions of patients, and the evidence to determine if they actually work is allowed to come later, if it comes at all.\nThe arrangement can have devastating costs for people like Laura MacMillan.\nStarting in 2001, Laura MacMillan was diagnosed with a series of puzzling medical conditions. First came interstitial cystitis. Two years later, when she was only 45, she developed severe abdominal pain and diarrhea that was diagnosed as colitis. \u201cI could barely leave my house,\u201d she says. \u201cI had frequent accidents and could only go to stores where I knew there was a bathroom.\u201d\nTwelve years later, she began to see wavy lines as her vision progressively dimmed. One evening, she drove over a cement island in a parking lot, leaving her with a flat tire and $4,700 of damage to her car. Her ophthalmologist could find no known diagnosis for her eye condition and could offer no treatment. Between the colitis and progressing blindness, MacMillan\u2019s world was closing in.\nFinally, in 2021, MacMillan came across Nieraj Jain\u2019s troubling findings of blindness linked to the interstitial cystitis drug Elmiron and instantly put two and two together. She had been on Elmiron for 20 years and had experienced the same retinal changes Jain uncovered. She stopped the drug and within weeks, her colitis symptoms went away. A subsequent colonoscopy showed her gut had completely healed, but MacMillan\u2019s vision loss is permanent.\n\u201cI can\u2019t drive anymore,\u201d she says. \u201cI had to stop working 13 years ago. When I get up in the morning, it can take about two hours for the blurriness to subside enough for me to see words on my tablet. Last summer, my husband and I drove [1,000 miles] to Toronto to see the Blue Jays play the Yankees. Even though we had good seats, I couldn\u2019t see a damn thing. So we won\u2019t ever be able to do that again.\u201d\nMacMillan is relatively lucky compared to the hundreds of others uncovered by this investigation who suffered serious injuries or died while taking the drug.\nThe FDA continues to approve medicines based on evidence as flimsy, contradictory, and inadequate as the data for Elmiron. Citing the need for \u201cflexibility\u201d and the importance of encouraging drug development when there are few treatment options, the agency has all but abandoned its hard-won standards for sound science, according to numerous experts.\nJerome Hoffman, professor emeritus of medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the lead analyst of the database created for this investigation, says, \u201cMost of us imagine that the primary goal of the FDA is to make sure that the drugs it approves are more likely to help people than to harm them. If so, the FDA would require drugmakers to submit rigorous studies. Instead, the agency seems to have forgotten about that goal and is more interested in promoting the interests of industry than protecting the public health.\u201d\nIn 2014, the Elmiron Study Group published their results of the long-awaited clinical trial that showed Elmiron was no better than a placebo. \u201cI thought that the next day it would be over for Elmiron,\u201d says Curtis Nickel, a urologist at Kingston Hospital in Ontario, Canada, who led the study group. \u201cDoctors would stop prescribing it. The FDA would order it off the market.\u201d But none of that happened.\nInstead, after 24 years, Elmiron is still being sold, and doctors continue to prescribe it. Hundreds of thousands of patients have been exposed to the drug, and the American Urological Association lists it as the only FDA-approved medication for interstitial cystitis. The agency finally added a warning to the drug label in 2020, alerting doctors and patients to the risk of vision loss.\nNowhere is there any mention that studies have never shown Elmiron is effective.\nKeep the press free.

Within about eight hours, Trump went from suggesting a nuclear deal with Iran remained \u201cachievable\u201d to urging Tehran\u2019s 9.5 million residents to flee for their lives.\nThe fighting has driven prices for crude oil and gasoline higher because Iran is a major oil exporter and it sits on the narrow Strait of Hormuz, through which much of the world\u2019s crude passes. Past conflicts in the area have caused spikes in oil prices, though they\u2019ve historically proven brief after showing that they did not disrupt the flow of oil.\nJapan reported that its exports fell in May as the auto industry was hit by Trump's higher tariffs, with exports to the U.S. falling more than 11%.

Energy analysts said the price could shoot to $100 a barrel \u2014 a level not seen since the aftermath of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 \u2014 if the conflict widens and interrupts oil shipments from the Middle East.\nNo matter how the fighting unfolds, it promises to increase prices at American gasoline pumps just as voters\u2019 natural gas and electricity bills are already set to rise. And it comes at a time when Trump may have fewer tools at his disposal than Biden did to blunt their impact.\nGasoline prices could jump as much as 25 cents a gallon in the coming weeks because of the fighting, predicted Patrick De Haan, a gasoline market analyst at the pricing website GasBuddy.com. Regular gasoline prices averaged $3.13 a gallon Friday.\nTrump, who campaigned heavily last year on cutting energy prices, has started complaining publicly about the global markets not comporting with his priorities.\nDuring a bill signing ceremony Wednesday, Trump chided Energy Secretary Chris Wright over this week\u2019s rise in oil prices, which had begun climbing amid news of a possibly imminent Israeli attack. \u201cI was going to call and really start screaming at you,\u201d Trump told Wright.\nEvery White House knows that presidents of either party suffer when higher gasoline prices beset voters. And Trump could be particularly vulnerable if a significant rise in fuel prices triggers the sort of economic slowdown that analysts have warned his tariffs could bring.\n\u201cGeopolitical price spikes pose a bigger risk of recession than inflation in my view,\u201d said Bob McNally, who heads the energy and geopolitical analysis firm Rapidan Energy and served on the National Security Council and National Economic Council during the George W. Bush administration. \u201cThe White House should be worried.\u201d\nTrump still has headroom for any rise in pump prices resulting from the Israel attack. Friday\u2019s average gasoline price was down 33 cents from a year ago and $1.88 from their all-time high in June 2022, according to AAA.\nBut if the fighting spreads, things could get politically hot for Trump quickly. If Israel targets Iran\u2019s oil fields or export facilities, prices could rise another $7.50 a barrel, said Andy Lipow, head of the market analysis firm Lipow Oil Associates. If Iran then attacks the Strait of Hormuz at the mouth of the Persian Gulf \u2014 a major waterway for oil exports out of the Middle East \u2014 \u201cwe could see $100 oil,\u201d Lipow said.\n\u201cIran knows full well that President Trump is focused on lower energy prices,\u201d Lipow said in an email. \u201cActions by Iran that impact Middle Eastern oil supplies raising gasoline and diesel prices for Americans are politically damaging to the president.\u201d\nWorryingly for the White House, Trump can do little to tamp down prices. The president\u2019s only real option include using his bully pulpit and diplomats to try to persuade Israel and Iran to quell the fighting soon.\nHe could also tell Wright to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, hoping that unleashing a gusher of crude into the global markets will keep the price under control. Biden took that step in a big way after Russia\u2019s Ukraine invasion, selling off more than 40 percent of the stockpile in a move that Republicans blasted as a politically minded misuse of a reserve meant for national emergencies.\nBut the reserve is still considerably smaller than it was pre-Biden, leaving Trump with less oil to release without depleting it. The reserve had 402 million barrels as of last week, down from 626 million barrels four years ago.\nA DOE spokesperson maintained that the administration was lowering prices by cutting regulations. \u201cWhile oil prices are dictated by supply and demand, the Trump administration is reducing regulatory costs and removing red tape holding back energy production, delivering lower energy costs for the American people,\u201d Andrea Woods said in an email.\nBefore this week, oil prices had fallen nearly $20 a barrel below where they were when Trump reentered the White House Jan. 20 \u2014 though the biggest drop came after Trump announced his \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs in early April, which triggered fears of a worldwide economic slowdown and threw energy demand into doubt. The oil producing countries in OPEC also boosted their own output earlier this year, further lessening prices \u2014 until now.\nAt the moment, the hike in oil prices seems to have stalled, said Tamas Varga, an analyst at the brokerage firm PVM Oil Associates, and they could come back down if the fighting settles.\n\u201cGiven that the situation is fluid it would not be surprising to see prices remain stable ahead of the weekend,\u201d Varga said in an email. \u201cNext Monday, however, there is a chance of a significant retracement provided the situation is contained. If there is no tangible supply shock, the current rally will not be maintained.\u201d\nThe low prices the White House started with may help blunt voter\u2019s anger at rising prices, said Kevin Book, director at analyst firm ClearView Energy. But that doesn\u2019t mean Trump can be complacent, given his campaign promises.\n\u201cPolitically, that offers Trump some headroom,\u201d Book said. \u201cBut, of course, Trump didn\u2019t campaign on keeping energy costs the same. He campaigned on bringing them down.\u201d", "The Saudis are hurting the US oil industry. Trump\u2019s unlikely to talk about it.. The Saudis are hurting the US oil industry. Trump\u2019s unlikely to talk about it.\nThe oil issue? \u201cIt\u2019s secondary,\u201d says one expert, as the president prepares for talks in the Middle East.\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s campaign promise of U.S. \u201cenergy dominance\u201d is running into a flood of OPEC crude oil \u2014 a surge of fuel production pushed by the Saudi leaders greeting him during his Mideast trip this week.\nBut don\u2019t expect Trump to complain about the cartel\u2019s plan to raise output by nearly a million barrels per day in June, according to three people familiar with the trip who were granted anonymity to describe private discussions.\nThe planned production surge has contributed to a sharp drop in oil prices this year, bringing economic pain to U.S. petroleum companies and undermining Trump\u2019s pledges of a huge increase in American energy production. But it also makes it easier for Trump to fulfill a second crucial but contradictory promise \u2014 big cuts in energy prices for the inflation-weary voters who helped return him to the White House.\nThe dynamic is yet another example of how external forces, including the Saudis\u2019 commanding role in the world\u2019s oil markets, continue to complicate Trump\u2019s frequent calls for a new American \u201cgolden age.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s current stance on energy appears to confirm what U.S. oil executives have been fearing: If caught between higher production and low prices, he\u2019ll pick the latter, said Bob McNally, founder and president of the consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group and a former energy adviser to President George W. Bush.\n\u201cIf there was any confusion as to which he prefers, there\u2019s none any more,\u201d McNally said.\nInstead of cajoling Saudi Arabia into easing off plans to produce more oil, the main topics of Trump\u2019s visit will be ongoing tensions in the Middle East \u2013 including U.S. negotiations with Iran \u2013 as well as a potential arms deal between Saudi Arabia and the United States, the three people said. The Trump administration may also ask for Gulf states to invest in the U.S., the people said.\n\u201cThe goal here is for everyone to build bridges,\u201d said one person familiar with the trip planning who was granted anonymity to discuss planning. \u201cWith the oil issue, it\u2019s secondary.\u201d\nThe White House did not respond to questions about whether OPEC\u2019s decision to increase output will be a topic during Trump\u2019s Middle East meetings or whether the president was concerned about how low prices were affecting the U.S. oil industry.\nSaudi Arabia, OPEC\u2019s de facto leader, has its own reasons for wanting higher oil production: it wants to regain market share after years of ceding it to rivals, even though the move will cause it short-term fiscal pain. News last month of the impending OPEC gusher pushed oil prices to their lowest levels in more than four years, with the benchmark U.S. price sinking below $55 per barrel briefly, down from more than $80 a year earlier.\nThe price was $61 on Friday, compared with $77 when Trump took office.\nU.S. oil companies are now cutting their spending on new wells after two consecutive years of record-setting production during the Biden era, and analysts are rolling back their previous forecasts for production increases.\nWith the market beset by OPEC\u2019s supply increase and the economic uncertainty caused by the Trump administration\u2019s trade war, U.S. oil production could actually decline in 2026, the first such drop since the Covid-19 pandemic caused a dramatic decline of global fuel demand, analyst firm S&P Global Commodity Insights said in a report.\nA drop caused by policy changes in the United States and Saudi Arabia would be a huge reversal for an industry that has been notching up record-high volumes almost continually since the fracking boom took hold in 2008.\n\u201cAlthough the magnitude of a potential economic and oil demand downturn is as uncertain as the future course of U.S. tariffs, the impact will be negative,\u201d Jim Burkhard, S&P\u2019s global head of crude oil research, said in a statement announcing the report. \u201cInitial warning signs of a potential downturn are only starting to come into view. The level of severity is now the big question.\u201d\nDuring the campaign, Trump frequently preached the clashing policy goals of cheap energy prices and sharply higher U.S. oil output as a core tenet of his \u201cenergy dominance\u201d agenda. That policy includes tapping reservoirs in protected areas such as Alaska\u2019s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, increasing lease sales on federal land and water, and speeding the issuance of drilling permits.\nThe oil and gas industry contributed an estimated $75 million to his campaign, despite some executives\u2019 misgivings about a return of the trade chaos that raised energy companies\u2019 prices and roiled their international markets during his first term. That amount was far less than the $1 billion that Trump had suggested during a meeting with oil executives a year ago at his home in Palm Beach, Florida, and even less than what Tesla CEO Elon Musk personally spent on the president\u2019s behalf.\nTrump has hailed the fall in domestic gasoline prices \u2014 even exaggerating how much it\u2019s dropped \u2014 as relief for consumers who had to pay a record-high national average of $5 per gallon nearly three years ago during Joe Biden\u2019s presidency. The decline also runs counter to the fears of inflation that have wracked the economy amid Trump\u2019s tariffs war.\nHe\u2019s kept up the praise even as U.S. oil prices hovered near $60 per barrel \u2014 a level where industry CEOs say they begin to slow their drills.\n\u201cGasoline just broke $1.98 a Gallon,\u201d he posted on Truth Social early this month, \u201clowest in years, groceries (and eggs!) down, energy down, mortgage rates down, employment strong, and much more good news, as Billions of Dollars pour in from Tariffs.\u201d\nHowever, average U.S. gasoline prices at the time were actually closer to $3.16 a gallon, and the widely respected gas-price monitor GasBuddy said none of the more than 100,000 stations it tracks showed a price at the level Trump claimed.\nAnalysts largely interpret OPEC\u2019s bid to hike output as the Saudis reasserting control over rival producers. Those include Kazakhstan, which has collaborated with the cartel under an expanded \u201cOPEC+\u201d umbrella that also includes Russia.\nFor the Trump administration, the bearish pressure on oil prices also helps ease concerns that its recent ratcheting up of sanctions on Iran\u2019s oil exports during negotiations over its nuclear program will tighten market supplies. A drop in Iranian shipments could also pave the way for Saudis to ship more oil to China, which has been the biggest buyer of Iranian crude.\nBut the new glut threatens to capsize the U.S. oil industry, which has parlayed the shale oil revolution into a nearly two-decade boom to become the world\u2019s biggest producer and a top-five exporter.\nU.S. oil production last year hit a record high of 13.4 million barrels a day last year, the highest output of any country in history. Meanwhile, U.S. gas production has risen enough to make the country the largest natural gas exporter in the world, a trade that gives it serious geopolitical clout.\nTrump and Gulf State officials will likely discuss oil market conditions at some point during this week\u2019s trip, even if it isn\u2019t an official topic on the schedule, said Landon Derentz, senior director of the global energy center at the think tank Atlantic Council.\n\u201cIt is conceivable that in a desert tent over dinner the two leaders would discuss the direction of global energy affairs,\u201d said Derentz, who was an energy and national security official under the first Trump and Biden administrations. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s agenda with Saudi Arabia will likely focus on broader national security and economic priorities, but he has a long history of working with [Saudi Crown Prince] Mohammed bin Salman on energy market issues and policy.\u201d\nIn earnings calls, U.S. oil producers have started talking about cutting spending plans for the rest of the year.\nIndependent oil company EOG Resources on May 1 cut its investment plans by $200 million for 2025. Diamondback Energy, another independent oil company, warned that the economic uncertainty unleashed by Trump\u2019s trade war would pull about 10 percent of the drilling rigs operating in the United States out of the field.\n\u201cAs a result of these activity cuts, it is likely that U.S. onshore oil production has peaked and will begin to decline this quarter,\u201d Diamondback Chief Executive Travis Stice said in a letter the company published Monday. \u201cWe believe we are at a tipping point for U.S. oil production at current commodity prices.\u201d\nOPEC\u2019s contribution to falling oil prices dovetails with Trump\u2019s promise to lower energy costs, said Paul Sankey, lead analyst at commodity firm Sankey Research \u2014 unwelcome news for the U.S. oil companies hoping for some sort of relief.\nSaudi government officials \u201dhaven\u2019t said they\u2019re going to crush the U.S. oil and gas industry, but it\u2019s a foregone conclusion,\u201d Sankey said in an interview. Meanwhile, \u201clow oil prices is one of the things [Trump] can point to as a promise delivered.\u201d\nThe problem is that the longer prices stay at current levels, the more the White House is putting at risk an oil industry that propelled the United States to the forefront of global energy markets, Sankey said.\n\u201cOne of the great success stories in the United States in the past 15 years is the oil and gas sector transforming the U.S.\u201d from a net energy importer to an exporting giant, Sankey continued. \u201cMaking that go away, which is what could happen next, is not going to be a great thing for the U.S.\u201d"]}, {"topic": 23, "name": "Defunding and US Budget", "keywords": "rescissions, funding, cuts, broadcasting, package, congress, house, public, the, request", "documents": ["White House sends Congress request for $9.4B in DOGE cuts. White House sends Congress request for $9.4B in DOGE cuts\nThe White House on Tuesday sent Congress a request to claw back $9.4 billion in funding for foreign aid and to public broadcasting \u2014 the first package that would codify the slashes spearheaded by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\nIt is a long-awaited move that many conservative activists have been clamoring for, even as House and Senate Republicans separately push forward on the One Big Beautiful Bill Act full of President Trump\u2019s tax cut and spending priorities.\nThe package needs only a simple majority to pass in each chamber, allowing Republicans to bypass the threat of a Democratic filibuster in the Senate. Congress has 45 days to approve the rescission request after it is submitted \u2014 but must balance that timeline with other top priorities like the \u201cbig, beautiful bill.\u201d\nThe House is aiming to vote on the package next week.\n\u201cToday, we have officially received the rescissions request from the White House to eliminate $9.4 billion in wasteful foreign aid spending at State and USAID and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds NPR and PBS,\u201d Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said. \u201cThe House will act quickly on this request.\u201d\nCommunication from President Trump officially making the request to rescind the funds was read on the House floor Tuesday afternoon.\n\u201cI herewith report 22 rescissions of budget authority totaling $9.4 billion. The proposed rescissions affect programs of the Department of State, as well as the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, United States Agency for International Development, the United States Institute of Peace, and other international assistance programs,\u201d the message from Trump said.\nThe package would rescind $8.3 billion in foreign aid, largely from funding that was approved for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which was largely dismantled as part of the DOGE efforts earlier this year.\nAn Office of Management and Budget (OMB) spokesperson pointed to millions of dollars in those accounts that funded global LGBTQ programs and other gender equity programs, as well as global climate change and green energy initiatives.\nIt would also cut almost $9 million from the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) \u2014 with an OMB spokesperson pointing to how it funded \u201c$3 million for circumcision, vasectomies, and condoms in Zambia\u201d and \u201c$5.1 million to strengthen the \u2018resilience of lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans gender, intersex, and queer global movements.\u2019\u201d It also rescinds $22 million from the African Development Foundation.\nThe package calls for more than $2 billion in cuts targeting what it described as \u201cunnecessary development assistance,\u201d elimination of funds for the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), the U.N. Development Program (UNDP) and other programs.\nMore than $1.6 billion would be clawed back from the Economic Support Fund (ESF), if Congress approved the proposal, along with $800 million for the Migration and Refugee Assistance (MRA) account at the State Department, which officials note provides funds for the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program and overseas humanitarian assistance.\nIt also calls for $400 million for global health programs implemented by USAID that funds \u201cactivities related to controlling HIV/AIDS.\u201d\n\u201cThis proposal would eliminate only those programs that neither provide life-saving treatment nor support American interests,\u201d the request states. \u201cThis rescission proposal aligns with the Administration\u2019s efforts to eliminate wasteful foreign assistance programs.\u201d\nRepublicans are heavily messaging on the package\u2019s $1.1 billion in rescissions to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides funding for NPR and PBS \u2014 two outlets that Republicans have decried as biased.\nThat includes cutting advanced appropriations approved by Congress for CPB, rescinding $535 million in both fiscal 2026 and 2027 each.\n\u201cThese funds would be used to subsidize a public media system that is politically biased and an unnecessary expense to the taxpayer. Enacting the rescission would eliminate Federal funding for CPB,\u201d the request states.\nBoth outlets have sued over Trump orders targeting their funding.\nThe cuts would amount to only a fraction of the estimated $175 billion in \u201csavings\u201d DOGE\u2019s website says it has racked up through a combination of efforts, including workforce reductions, grants and contract cancellations, as well as regulatory savings and asset sales.\nHowever, top Democrats on the House and Senate Appropriations committees have accused the Trump administration of illegally freezing $425 billion in federal funding as of Tuesday, as it has undertaken a sweeping operation to shrink the size of the federal government.\nConservatives in both chambers have been confident that the GOP-led Congress will be able to push through the proposed cuts. Some are hopeful the package will be the first of multiple from the White House in the months ahead, particularly as the Trump administration\u2019s downsizing efforts face roadblocks in court.\n\u201cI think we\u2019ll get it done. I really do,\u201d House Appropriations Chair Tom Cole (R-Okla.) told reporters shortly after the request\u2019s release on Tuesday, though he also said there\u2019s \u201ccertainly some things\u201d he \u201cwould disagree with.\u201d\nHowever, some senators have already signaled changes will likely be made to the request. Other Republicans have also expressed concerns about how funding cuts would impact television stations back home and about the impact of cutting PEPFAR funding.\n\u201cBefore I decide on what I\u2019ll agree to, I want to find out what it would do to my Native American populations who use the am radio, I think FM, in some areas, to actually communicate throughout those rural areas,\u201d Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) said Tuesday.\nSenate Appropriations Committee Chair Susan Collins (R-Maine) also said in a statement that, despite the \u201cfast track\u201d rescission process, the committee \u201cwill carefully review the rescissions package and examine the potential consequences of these rescissions on global health, national security, emergency communications in rural communities, and public radio and television stations.\u201d\nThe Impoundment Control Act provides the president with a legal pathway to cancel congressionally approved funds. The 1974 law allows the president to temporarily withhold funding after the administration sends its request to Congress. But if Congress fails to greenlight Trump\u2019s proposed rescissions, the administration must release the funding.\nTrump has been the only president to send the special message to Congress in the past two decades in an effort to yank back funds. He also attempted to pull back funds during his first term using the same process but was unsuccessful, despite Republicans controlling the House, Senate and White House at the time.\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc.

President Donald Trump sent the rescissions request that led to the House bill to the Republican-controlled Congress earlier this month.\nRepublican Reps. Mark Amodei of Nevada, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Nicole Malliotakis of New York and Mike Turner of Ohio voted against approving the bill along with all of the chamber\u2019s Democrats.\nNebraska Rep. Don Bacon and New York Rep. Nick LaLota, both Republicans, switched from opposing to supporting the bill after Speaker Mike Johnson spoke with them on the floor as the vote was held open.\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., contended during floor debate that pulling back the funding is the right place to start, but said the GOP will seek to do much more in the months and years ahead.\nScalise said PBS and NPR should have to compete against other media organizations without grant funding from the federal government.\n\u201cThere is still going to be a plethora of options for the American people,\u201d Scalise said. \u201cBut if they\u2019re paying their hard-earned dollars to go get content, why should your tax dollars only go to one thing that the other side wants to promote? Let everybody go compete on a fair basis.\u201d\nMaine Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree said every state in the country would feel the impact of eliminating funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\n\u201cI rise today in strong opposition to the reckless attack on public media contained within this rescissions bill and millions of Americans who rely on and treasure their local public television and radio stations,\u201d Pingree said.\nEfforts to defund CPB, she said, were the result of Trump\u2019s \u201cagenda against the free press and his authoritarian desire to control the media.\u201d\nPublic media would lose $1.1 billion\nThe seven-page bill would rescind all funding that Congress approved for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for fiscal years 2026 and 2027, a total of $1.1 billion.\nCPB, which provides grants to public radio and television stations throughout the country, is one of the few programs that receives an advanced appropriation. So the funding elimination envisioned in the House bill would take effect starting on Oct. 1.\nThe legislation revokes more than $8 billion from several foreign aid programs run by the U.S. State Department or the U.S. Agency for International Development.\nFlorida Republican Rep. Mario D\u00edaz-Balart, chairman of the State-Foreign Operations Appropriations subcommittee, said during an interview Wednesday there were extensive talks between GOP lawmakers and the Office of Management and Budget before the Trump administration officially submitted this rescissions request.\nBut D\u00edaz-Balart cautioned there would need to be substantial pre-negotiations ahead of any future rescissions requests for programs within his annual funding bill.\n\u201cThis rescission package \u2014 which I\u2019ve had communication with OMB on \u2014 if this passes, we can move forward,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, if you\u2019re talking about a potential for future additional rescissions, that could potentially create a problem and tie the president\u2019s hands when it comes to dealing with adversaries or helping allies.\u201d\nD\u00edaz-Balart said that OMB officials hoping to make any additional rescissions requests on foreign aid would need to engage in \u201ca level of coordination that is so detailed, so intense to make sure that nothing comes forward that could potentially hurt the president\u2019s ability to really do the America First agenda internationally.\u201d\nFlorida Democratic Rep. Lois Frankel, ranking member on the State-Foreign Operations spending panel, said during floor debate Thursday the bill was an attack on American values and posed a threat to national security.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not charity, it\u2019s strategy,\u201d Frankel said of foreign aid. \u201cDon\u2019t take my word for it, military leaders from both parties have warned us for years \u2014 if we fail to lead with soft power, we\u2019ll end up paying in blood, bombs and more boots on the ground.\u201d\n\u201cCutting foreign assistance will deepen desperation, fuel extremism, push fragile societies toward collapse and when that happens we all pay the price,\u201d she added. \u201cRefugee crises surge, diseases spread, trade routes shut down, our troops and diplomats face greater danger and our homeland security is weakened.\u201d\nFirst of many requests\nThe House vote took place just one week after the Trump administration sent lawmakers the rescissions request, the first of many proposals the White House budget office plans to submit.\nThe $9.4 billion cancellation proposal represents a small fraction of the roughly $6.8 trillion the federal government spends each year.\nThe recommendation said some of the foreign aid should be cancelled because it supported \u201cprograms that are antithetical to American interests and worsen the lives of women and children, like \u2018family planning\u2019 and \u2018reproductive health,\u2019 LGBTQI+ activities, and \u2018equity\u2019 programs.\u201d\nThe rescissions request allows the Office of Management and Budget to legally freeze funding on the programs listed for 45 days while lawmakers decide whether to approve the recommendation as is, amend it, or ignore it.\nThe House and Senate must agree to approve the same rescissions bill before mid-July for the changes to take effect. Failure to reach a bicameral agreement before then would require the Trump administration to spend the funding and block the president from requesting the same cancellation for the rest of his term.\nRescissions requests are rare since Congress typically negotiates spending levels on thousands of federal programs in the dozen annual spending bills that are then signed by the president.\nThe first Trump administration proposed rescissions in 2018, but the bill never made it through the Senate.\nThe last time Congress actually approved rescinding funding was in 1992 during the George H.W. Bush administration, according to a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.\nMore action in the Senate\nThe Senate will need to take up the bill before mid-July if it wants to approve any of the spending cuts, though several GOP senators told States Newsroom during brief interviews Wednesday ahead of the House vote they may amend the package, which would require it to go back to the House for final approval before the 45-day clock runs out.\nRescissions bills come with a vote-a-rama in the Senate, giving Republicans and Democrats the chance to call up as many amendments as they want for a floor vote. The GOP holds a 53-member majority, so four or more Republicans opposing any element of the bill would likely lead to its removal.\nSenate Appropriations Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine, said she will give the rescissions bill \u201ccareful consideration.\u201d\nIn a statement released earlier this month just after the White House sent the request to lawmakers, Collins wrote the committee would \u201ccarefully review the rescissions package and examine the potential consequences of these rescissions on global health, national security, emergency communications in rural communities, and public radio and television stations.\u201d\nSouth Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, chairman of the State-Foreign Operations Appropriations subcommittee, said he\u2019s mostly supportive of the rescissions request, though he didn\u2019t rule out offering an amendment to restore full funding for the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, often called PEPFAR.\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll be okay with most of it. I\u2019m concerned about PEPFAR. I\u2019ll have to look at that,\u201d Graham said.\nWest Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, chairwoman of the spending panel that oversees the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, said she\u2019s planning to evaluate the bill once it arrives.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got all these other things I\u2019m thinking about. I haven\u2019t even focused on it,\u201d Capito said, referring to ongoing negotiations over the party\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill.\u201d\nAlaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, said she\u2019s going to \u201ctry to\u201d ensure the Corporation for Public Broadcasting keeps its funding.\n\u201cI\u2019m a supporter of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. It\u2019s a lifeline for many of my small, rural communities,\u201d Murkowski said\nKansas Republican Sen. Jerry Moran, a senior appropriator, said he\u2019s \u201ctrying to figure out a strategy of how to deal with\u201d both the foreign aid and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting provisions once the bill comes over from the House.\n\u201cI\u2019m looking at both of them to see what the right outcome should be.\u201d\n\u2018The risk of living in a news desert\u2019\nBoth PBS and NPR released statements following the House vote, pledging to do their best to keep their funding intact.\nKatherine Maher, NPR president and CEO, wrote in a statement the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is essential to the organization.\n\u201cAmericans who rely on local, independent stations serving communities across America, especially in rural and underserved regions, will suffer the immediate consequences of this vote,\u201d Maher wrote. \u201cIf rescission passes and local stations go dark, millions of Americans will no longer have access to locally owned, independent, nonprofit media and will bear the risk of living in a news desert, missing their emergency alerts, and hearing silence where classical, jazz and local artists currently play.\u201d\nPaula Kerger, president and CEO at PBS, wrote in a separate statement the \u201cfight to protect public media does not end with this vote, and we will continue to make the case for our essential service in the days and weeks to come.\n\u201cIf these cuts are finalized by the Senate, it will have a devastating impact on PBS and local member stations, particularly smaller and rural stations that rely on federal funding for a larger portion of their budgets.

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)\nThis report has been updated.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration sent its first spending cuts request to Congress on Tuesday, asking lawmakers to swiftly eliminate $9.4 billion in funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and various foreign aid programs.\nThe request for what are called rescissions allows the White House budget office to legally freeze spending on those accounts for 45 days while the Republican-controlled Congress debates whether to approve the recommendation in full or in part, or to ignore it.\nThe proposal calls on lawmakers to eliminate $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides funding for National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service. That means NPR and PBS would lose their already approved federal allocations, if the request is approved by Congress.\nPresident Donald Trump issued an executive order in May seeking to block the Corporation for Public Broadcasting from providing funding for NPR and PBS, leading to two separate lawsuits citing First Amendment concerns.\nIn the rescissions request, Trump wants to cut $8.3 billion from foreign aid programs, including the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, a global initiative to combat HIV/AIDS, and the African Development Foundation.\nThe proposal is the first of several that will seek to codify efforts undertaken by U.S. DOGE Service and billionaire Elon Musk before he left his official role as a special government employee.\nWhite House budget director Russ Vought wrote in a letter accompanying the request that it \u201cemphasizes the need to cut wasteful foreign assistance spending at the Department of State and USAID and through other international assistance programs.\u201d\n\u201cThese rescissions would eliminate programs that are antithetical to American interests, such as funding the World Health Organization, LGBTQI+ activities, \u2018equity\u2019 programs, radical Green New Deal-type policies, and color revolutions in hostile places around the world,\u201d Vought wrote. \u201cIn addition, Federal spending on CPB subsidizes a public media system that is politically biased and is an unnecessary expense to the taxpayer.\u201d\nGOP leaders in Congress appear likely to hold floor votes on the request, which only needs a simple majority to pass the Senate, avoiding the need for Democratic support to get past the 60-vote legislative filibuster.\nSpeaker Mike Johnson, R-La., wrote in a statement the House \u201cwill act quickly on this request.\u201d\n\u201cThis rescissions package reflects many of DOGE\u2019s findings and is one of the many legislative tools Republicans are using to restore fiscal sanity,\u201d Johnson wrote. \u201cCongress will continue working closely with the White House to codify these recommendations, and the House will bring the package to the floor as quickly as possible.\u201d\nBut Republican leaders could run into problems with centrist Republicans in each chamber, especially those on the Appropriations committees, which approved the funding in the first place.\nThe GOP holds especially narrow majorities in Congress, requiring the support of nearly every one of the 220 Republicans in the House and the party\u2019s 53 senators.\nRepublican leaders may need to negotiate what exactly gets written into the rescissions bill if too many moderate Republicans raise objections to cutting off the funding.\nSenate Appropriations Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine, wrote in a statement the committee \u201cwill carefully review the rescissions package and examine the potential consequences of these rescissions on global health, national security, emergency communications in rural communities, and public radio and television stations.\u201d\nForeign aid, public media take hits\nThe request calls for lawmakers to make cuts to dozens of foreign aid programs, including $500 million out of $4 billion for certain global health programs at the U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\u201cThis proposal would not reduce treatment but would eliminate programs that are antithetical to American interests and worsen the lives of women and children, like \u2018family planning\u2019 and \u2018reproductive health,\u2019 LGBTQI+ activities, and \u2018equity\u2019 programs,\u201d the request states. \u201cThis rescission proposal aligns with the Administration\u2019s efforts to eliminate wasteful USAID foreign assistance programs.\u201d\nThe rescissions request proposes Congress eliminate $400 million of the $6 billion for global health programs that seek to control HIV/AIDS, which OMB writes \u201cwould eliminate only those programs that neither provide life-saving treatment nor support American interests.\u201d\nThe request asks lawmakers to eliminate $2.5 billion of the $3.9 billion they approved for development assistance, which \u201cis intended to fund programs that work to end extreme poverty and promote resilient, democratic societies, but in practice, many of the DA programs conflict with American values, interfere with the sovereignty of other countries, and bankroll corrupt leaders\u2019 evasion of their responsibilities to their citizens, all while providing no clear benefit to Americans.\u201d\nThe proposal calls on lawmakers to eliminate more than $1 billion in funding across two fiscal years for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which the administration wrote \u201cwould be used to subsidize a public media system that is politically biased and an unnecessary expense to the taxpayer.\u201d\nPresident and CEO of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting Patricia Harrison wrote in a statement the organization \u201cis firmly committed to ensuring that funding for public media provides local communities with accurate, unbiased, and nonpartisan news and information, and we take seriously concerns about bias that have been raised.\n\u201cThe path to better public media is achievable only if funding is maintained. Otherwise, a vital lifeline that operates reliable emergency communications, supports early learning, and keeps local communities connected and informed will be cut off with regrettable and lasting consequences.\u201d\nPresident and CEO of PBS Paula Kerger wrote in a separate statement that the \u201cproposed rescissions would have a devastating impact on PBS member stations and the essential role they play in communities, particularly smaller and rural stations that rely on federal funding for a larger portion of their budgets.\n\u201cWithout PBS member stations, Americans will lose unique local programming and emergency services in times of crisis.\u201d\nKerger wrote that PBS would seek to keep its funding by demonstrating \u201cour value to Congress, as we have over the last 50 years, in providing educational, enriching programs and critical services to all Americans every day for free.\u201d\nNPR CEO Katherine Maher wrote that Congress enacting the rescissions \u201cwould irreparably harm communities across America who count on public media for 24/7 news, music, cultural and educational programming, and emergency alerting services.\u201d\n\u201cPublic safety in every community across the nation could also be affected. NPR, as the entity chosen by public radio stations to operate the nationwide Public Radio Satellite System (PRSS), receives Presidential-level emergency alerts and distributes them across the country within minutes,\u201d Maher wrote. \u201cIn the event of a national attack or emergency, communities no longer served by a station would not receive this lifesaving, early warning and civil defense alert.\u201d\nMore details\nA summary of the proposal shared with States Newsroom by the White House budget office ahead of its official release later in the day says the funding cuts would affect programs that sought to reduce xenophobia in Venezuela; support electoral reforms and voter education in Kenya; fund voter identification in Haiti; provide electric buses in Rwanda; broadcast the longtime PBS children\u2019s show \u201cSesame Street\u201d in Iraq; and strengthen the resilience of LGBTQ global movements.\nThe proposal would also cut off funding to Harvard University to conduct research models for peace and to New York University to analyze democracy field experiments in South Sudan, according to the OMB summary.\nPEPFAR would no longer have funding for circumcision, vasectomies, and condoms in Zambia, or for services for \u201ctransgender people, sex workers and their clients and sexual networks\u201d in Nepal, according to the OMB summary.\nLouisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, a vocal supporter of PEPFAR, said during a brief interview that he was told \u201cthat PEPFAR had some cuts, but that the basic core mission was continued.\u201d\nCassidy \u2014 chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee \u2014 said his staff was carefully reviewing the request and knows he cares \u201cabout this deeply.\u201d\nThe rescissions request, which asks lawmakers to claw back already approved funding, is different from the president\u2019s budget request, which proposes spending levels for thousands of federal programs for the upcoming fiscal year.\nBoth are merely proposals, since the Constitution grants Congress the power of the purse in Article I, Section 9, Clause 7.\nTiming on Senate floor vote unclear\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Monday that lawmakers in that chamber will begin reviewing the rescissions request this month, but didn\u2019t detail exactly when he\u2019d hold a floor vote.\n\u201cAnother item high on our list to begin work on in June is a rescissions package the White House intends to send Congress this week,\u201d Thune said. \u201cThe administration has identified a number of wasteful uses of taxpayer dollars and we will be taking up this package and eliminating this waste. We\u2019ll make that a priority.\u201d\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Appropriations Committee ranking member Patty Murray, D-Wash., wrote in a statement released Monday that \u201cTrump is looking to go after PBS and NPR to settle political scores and muzzle the free press, while undermining foreign assistance programs that push back on China\u2019s malign influence, save lives, and address other bipartisan priorities.\u201d\n\u201cIf Republicans choose to go along with this rescission package, they will follow Trump at their peril,\u201d Schumer and Murray wrote. \u201cThe power of the purse is one of Congress\u2019s most fundamental Constitutional responsibilities. Democrats will not allow Republicans to play games with the budget.\u201d\nLouisiana Republican Sen. John Kennedy said during a brief interview Tuesday that he plans to \u201ccarefully\u201d evaluate the rescissions request.\nWest Virginia GOP Sen. Shelley Moore Capito said Tuesday that she would go over the proposals once it officially arrives from the White House to determine whether she can support moving it across the floor.\n\u201cIt could be a fight. It could not be a fight,\u201d Capito said. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know.\u201d\nThe House Freedom Caucus, a group of far-right members led by Maryland Rep. Andy Harris, posted Monday its members hope the administration sends additional rescissions requests as quickly as possible.\n\u201cPassing this rescissions package will be an important demonstration of Congress\u2019s willingness to deliver on DOGE and the Trump agenda,\u201d the Freedom Caucus statement said. \u201cWhile the Swamp will inevitably attempt to slow and kill these cuts, there is no excuse for a Republican House not to advance the first DOGE rescissions package the same week it is presented to Congress then quickly send it for passage in the Republican Senate so President Trump can sign it into law.\u201d\nLast updated 4:54 p.m., Jun. 3, 2025\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

GOP megabill could undermine US energy production, Republicans warn\nFive takeaways from the Trump administration officials, lawmakers, business leaders who spoke at POLITICO\u2019s Energy Summit.\nRepublicans want to expand power production to shore up the grid and support the growth of data centers \u2014 but their own megabill risks doing the exact opposite.\nThat\u2019s the message lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, industry executives and former Republican officials delivered on stage at the POLITICO Energy Summit on Tuesday.\nThe reconciliation bill that passed the House last month seeks to gut clean energy tax credits enacted by Democrats in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, particularly for wind and solar \u2014 two of the fastest-growing sources on the grid. President Donald Trump has derided those subsidies as the \u201cGreen New Scam,\u201d and congressional Republicans have said the two technologies must stand on their own after decades of support.\nBut the speedy sunset of the investment and production tax credits under the House bill would hurt companies that have made investments based on the IRA, several of the Summit speakers said.\nThe House-passed bill is not \u201cfair to businesses in the way that we\u2019re phasing [the credits] out,\u201d said Utah Republican Sen. John Curtis. \u201cInvestors have invested billions of dollars based on the rules of the road, and you have employees who have set careers based on these things.\u201d\nEnergy companies have warned the bill could lead to the cancellation of hundreds of major electricity generation projects, just as the nation\u2019s utilities prepare for a surge in power demand from new AI data centers.\nJohn Ketchum, chair and CEO of NextEra, the nation\u2019s biggest owner of natural gas-fired power plants and the world\u2019s leading generator of electricity from wind and solar power, said he agrees with the Trump administration\u2019s declaration of an energy emergency \u2014 but warned renewables cannot be taken \u201coff the table.\u201d\n\u201cWe cannot afford to do that. If we do that, we will lose the AI race, and we will bring this economic expansion in the United States to a screeching halt,\u201d Ketchum said. That\u2019s because a new fleet of natural gas power plants won\u2019t be ready until 2032, he added, and nuclear power will take even longer.\nAnd former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chair Neil Chatterjee, who served under the first Trump administration, said fossil fuels must be complemented by renewables and emerging technologies like geothermal and nuclear \u2014 as well as energy efficiency efforts.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t possibly win the AI race and keep energy reliable and affordable with only fossil fuels,\u201d Chatterjee said. \u201cWe need every available electron.\u201d\nBut the backing for renewables drew pushback from Jarrod Agen, the executive director of Trump\u2019s newly created National Energy Dominance Council, who said he was \u201cvery happy\u201d with the bill the House produced.\nWind and solar are \u201cintermittent\u201d sources, he said, that \u201ccan\u2019t stand on their own feet.\u201d\nWhile the administration believes that nuclear energy will ultimately be the \u201cperfect source,\u201d fossil fuels and coal are the most reliable and secure sources today, Agen said.\nHere are some other takeaways from Tuesday\u2019s event:\nPressure on Senate to tweak megabill\nCurtis, who has urged his Senate colleagues for months to preserve the IRA credits, specifically called for the bill to set a phase-out date for the clean energy tax credits based on when developers start construction of new projects, rather than on when a project begins producing electricity, as the House bill does. The House language discourages new investment because construction timelines are often uncertain, he said.\n\u201cChanging it to say something about the date [construction] started would be a really significant difference and not really hurt the intent of what Republicans are trying to do on this bill,\u201d Curtis said.\nThat echoed comments from Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), the top Democrat on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, who also urged changes to the bill\u2019s prohibition on foreign involvement in projects, which he said is \u201ccompletely unworkable in its current form.\u201d\nEven Jennifer Granholm, who oversaw much of the growth spurred by the credits as the Biden administration\u2019s energy secretary, told the summit the bill could be \u201cworkable\u201d if the Senate fixes those two provisions, as well as restores rules that allow companies to buy and sell the tax credits.\nFERC\u2019s fading independence\nFormer FERC leaders bemoaned President Donald Trump\u2019s treatment of the agency, with Chatterjee warning the moves could turn the independent regulator into the \u201cEPA,\u201d which has whipsawed between administrations.\nTrump requested that former Democratic Chair Willie Phillips depart the commission, and last week declined to renominate current Republican Chair Mark Christie for a second term. His administration has moved to exert more power over other independent agencies as well.\n\u201cIf the White House exerts control over the agency and they have to clear everything through OIRA and through OMB, then effectively the role of FERC chairman is no longer as head of an independent agency, it\u2019s basically a staff position,\u201d Chatterjee told the audience.\nNobody can fathom what Elon\u2019s deal is\nThe energy world is still processing the falling-out between Trump and his former \u201cfirst buddy,\u201d clean energy and electric vehicle entrepreneur Elon Musk.\nHouse Energy and Commerce Chair Brett Guthrie (R-Ky.) told the summit that Musk never brought up objections to the Republican megabill during a breakfast just hours after the House passed the measure.\n\u201cHe talked about AI, he talked about all this stuff that [was] energy,\u201d Guthrie said. \u201cNever mentioned the bill. And the bill had just been voted.\u201d\nGranholm signaled that clean energy advocates could welcome Musk back into the fold, calling his electric vehicle company Tesla \u201camazing\u201d while noting the \u201clater part of his journey has been more challenging.\u201d\nPressed on Musk\u2019s support for clean energy, Agen, the White House official, said: \u201cThe President is in charge.\u201d\nWhere Democrats turn next\nGranholm acknowledged that Democrats should have done a better job on the campaign trail last year selling their vision of job creation from the clean energy transition.\nBut the party going forward also needs to hone its messaging on \u201ckeeping costs low by using the cheapest form of energy,\u201d which is renewables, Granholm said.\nHeinrich, too, forecast that Republicans\u2019 fossil fuel push would drive up energy prices \u2014 and provide a political opening to Democrats.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a constrained supply environment and an increased demand environment,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople\u2019s electricity bills all over the country are going to go up. What I can guarantee you is in the next election and the election after that Republicans are going to own increased energy prices.\u201d", "Republicans in Congress axed the \u2018green new scam,\u2019 but it\u2019s a red state boon. 5:00\nrepublished\nRepublicans in Congress axed the \u2018green new scam,\u2019 but it\u2019s a red state boon\nA worker installs a solar panel on a roof. (Getty Images)\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Clean energy manufacturers and advocates say they\u2019re perplexed how the repeal of tax credits in President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cone big beautiful bill\u201d will keep their domestic production lines humming across the United States, particularly in states that elected him to the Oval Office.\nWhile some Republicans have labeled the billions in tax credits a \u201cgreen new scam,\u201d statistics reviewed by States Newsroom show the jobs and benefits would boost predominantly GOP-leaning states and congressional districts. Now the industry is already slowing amid Trump\u2019s back-and-forth tariff policy and mixed messaging on energy and manufacturing.\nTrump vowed in early April that he would \u201csupercharge our domestic industrial base.\u201d\n\u201cJobs and factories will come roaring back to our country, and you see it happening already,\u201d he told a crowd in the White House Rose Garden while unveiling his new trade policy.\nBut as a way to pay for the $3.9 trillion price tag of extending and expanding the 2017 corporate and individual tax cuts, U.S. House Republicans found billions of dollars in savings by slashing over a dozen clean energy tax credits enacted in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act under President Joe Biden.\nCritics say the mega-bill, which passed the GOP-led House on May 22 in a 215-214 vote, would effectively strip away the Advanced Manufacturing and Production Credit and other incentives.\nThey have bolstered the production of batteries and solar components in numerous states \u2014 top among them North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan, South Carolina, Indiana, Tennessee, Texas, Nevada, Illinois and Oklahoma, according to the Clean Investment Monitor, a joint project by the Rhodium Group and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research.\nU.S. senators are now negotiating the massive budget reconciliation legislation.\nKevin Doffling, CEO and founder of Project Vanguard, an organization that connects veterans to clean energy jobs, warned pulling the plug on the clean energy tax credits will stifle progress the U.S. has made against other countries, namely China.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just going to see a huge pullback from investments inside of advanced manufacturing here in the U.S., and then we\u2019ll go source it from other places, instead of doing it here,\u201d Doffling said on a May 28 press call pressing for senators to protect the tax credits.\nDoffling\u2019s organization works in several states, including Arizona, Colorado, Indiana, Minnesota, Washington and Utah.\nMoving away from fossil fuels\nThe suite of tax credits enacted under the IRA incentivized homeowners, car buyers, energy producers and manufacturers to invest in types of energy beyond fossil fuels, with the aim of a reduction in the effects of climate change.\nFor example, the IRA\u2019s Advanced Manufacturing and Production Credit is awarded per unit produced and sold, and in some cases the capacity of energy output.\nBattery cell manufacturers can earn up to $35 per battery cell multiplied by potential kilowatt hours. In the case of solar, the credit offers producers 7 cents per solar module multiplied by wattage output. For mining operations extracting critical minerals, such as lithium, companies can receive a 10% tax break on the costs of production.\nMost credits phase out by 2032 under the Biden-era law, except those for critical mineral mining, which continue.\nA group of House Republicans, who have dubbed the tax credits the \u201cgreen new scam\u201d \u2014 echoing Trump\u2019s rhetoric \u2014 pushed to accelerate the expiration in the final version of the mega-bill, even for critical mineral mining and production. The federal government classifies critical minerals as crucial to national security.\nThe House-passed bill also severely tightens language around foreign components, titled \u201cforeign entities of concern,\u201d making the credit practically unusable as many parts of the clean energy manufacturing supply chain are global, industry professionals say.\nThe legislation also repeals \u201ctransferability,\u201d which allows companies with little or no tax liability to sell the credits.\nFor example, a critical mineral mining company would not turn a profit during an initial phase and could sell the credits to offset the cost of operations.\nSchneider Electric, a global corporation with a U.S. base in Massachusetts, has facilitated 18 transfer deals worth $1.7 billion in tax credits for U.S. companies since 2023. In a statement, Schneider said the deals \u201creflect growing market interest in flexible financing mechanisms that directly fund renewable projects.\u201d\nSilfab Solar, which recently built a solar cell manufacturing and module assembly plant in Fort Mill, South Carolina, announced in mid-May the sale of $110 million in Advanced Manufacturing and Production Credits to help fund its expansion. The company already runs a solar manufacturing site in Burlington, Washington.\nInvestment soared\nSpurred by the Advanced Manufacturing and Production Credit, known as 45X, actual investment in clean energy manufacturing since August 2022 reached $115 billion in April, up from $21 billion over the same length of time prior to the IRA, the Clean Investment Monitor found.\nOf the 380 clean technology production facilities announced since the third quarter of 2022, 161 are now operational, according to CIM data.\nThe credit spurred a \u201csea change\u201d in U.S. clean energy manufacturing, said Mike Williams, senior fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress and former deputy director of the BlueGreen Alliance, which advocates for the joining of labor and environmental organizations.\nDespite solar technology\u2019s roots in the U.S., the nation \u201cdidn\u2019t even have a toe\u201d in solar manufacturing, Williams said. Other countries, most notably Germany and then China, have dominated the industry.\n\u201cBut after the Inflation Reduction Act passed, all of a sudden we see panel manufacturing, we see parts and components manufacturing, absolutely exploding. Plants have announced and started construction in Georgia, in Oklahoma,\u201d Williams said in an interview with States Newsroom.\nActive manufacturing of solar components, advanced batteries and wind turbines and vessels is concentrated in rural areas. Most are located in states that went red in the 2024 presidential election, according to the Clean Power America Association\u2019s May 2025 State of Clean Energy Manufacturing in America report.\nThe renewable energy policy group estimated the industry supports 122,000 full-time manufacturing jobs across the U.S.\nActive solar manufacturing sites and expansions are clustered in Texas, Ohio and Alabama, according to data from the association. Should major project announcements in Georgia pull through, the state would surpass Alabama for third place.\nAdvanced battery manufacturing spans 38 states, with the largest concentrations in California, Michigan and North Carolina.\nBut various parts of the battery production process stretch throughout the country \u2014 for example, battery cell production in Nevada and Tennessee and module production in Utah. Other supporting hardware is made in South Carolina, Arizona and Texas.\nLithium, a critical mineral for battery production, is currently mined in Nevada and California. And investors are eyeing other spots in the U.S., namely Alaska, to mine and produce graphite, another critical mineral.\nChina largely dominates the world\u2019s critical mineral supply chain, according to U.S. Geological Survey data for 2024.\nWhen accounting for the full suite of clean energy tax credits that were enacted in 2022 \u2014 including residential, electric vehicles and clean electricity credits \u2014 just over 312,900 new jobs are linked to the industry, the bulk in Republican-led congressional districts, according to the advocacy group Climate Power\u2019s 2024 report on clean energy employment.\nTroy Van Beek, CEO and founder of the Iowa-based solar company Ideal Energy, said his business weathered the pandemic and has been able to add jobs, but is now facing uncertainty again.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting our feet under us and really starting to operate. I went from 20-some jobs to over 60 jobs, and those are good-paying jobs for people and their families. So we need that stability in the industry,\u201d said Van Beek, who spoke on the call with Doffling.\n\u201cWhat troubles me is the rocking of the boat to such a degree that we can\u2019t get anything done, and that\u2019s been very difficult to deal with,\u201d he said.\nIndustry slowdown\nThe industry has seen a pullback since January and the beginning of the Trump presidency.\nSix announced projects representing $6.9 billion in investment were canceled in the first quarter of 2025, according to the Clean Investment Monitor\u2019s latest State of U.S. Clean Energy Supply Chains report. While investment in clean energy overall continues to grow, the beginning of 2025 shows a slowdown from where the industry was a year ago.\nVan Beek, whose solar company provides construction and installation among others services, said recent talks to strike a deal with a solar manufacturer collapsed after threats to the tax credits.\n\u201cWe had worked an entire year on putting together (a deal) with one of the leading manufacturers in the world that has U.S. manufacturing to actually have joint ventures and work with them on projects,\u201d Van Beek said. \u201cAnd when this came up, that deal came to a screeching halt.\u201d\nVan Beek did not name the company on the call and did not respond to a request for a follow-up interview.\nSeveral companies declined States Newsroom\u2019s requests for comment while senators negotiate the bill.\nSpencer Pederson of the National Electrical Manufacturers Association said the unpredictability is interrupting how operators are planning for the coming years.\n\u201cWhether large or small, just the business certainty and the ability to plan out your business is disrupted when you have any type of tax mechanism that is abruptly halted when you\u2019re doing business planning at five- or 10-year intervals,\u201d said Pederson, the association\u2019s senior vice president of public affairs.\nToo expensive, Republicans say\nSome House Republicans, led by Rep. Jen Kiggans of Virginia, urged party colleagues to protect the clean energy tax credits \u2014 for example by removing the \u201coverly prescriptive\u201d restrictions on foreign entities of concern and keeping in place transferability of tax credits.\nKiggans wrote to House Republican tax writers in mid-May that \u201cthe last thing any of us want is to provoke an energy crisis or cause higher energy bills for working families.\u201d\nHer co-signers included Don Bacon of Nebraska, Mark Amodei of Nevada, Rob Bresnahan of Pennsylvania, Juan Ciscomani of Arizona, Gabe Evans and Jeff Hurd of Colorado, Dave Joyce of Ohio and Dan Newhouse of Washington, who all eventually voted for the final bill.\nFar-right House members won on not only shortening the lifespan of the credits, but also on keeping the restrictive foreign entity language and on repealing a company\u2019s ability to transfer credits.\nThe right-leaning National Taxpayers Union hailed the \u201ccommonsense changes\u201d championed by the far-right House Freedom Caucus, under the leadership of Maryland Rep. Andy Harris.\nThe organization, which favors cutting government spending and lowering taxes, pointed to the cost. According to the Penn Wharton Budget Model, the credits as of 2022 were valued at roughly $384.9 billion over ten years.\n\u201cThe longer these subsidies remain in law, the more expensive they will become and the harder it will be for Congress to remove them. Now it\u2019s up to the Senate to support the Green New Deal Rollbacks,\u201d Thomas Aiello, NTU\u2019s senior director of government affairs, wrote in the days following the House vote.\nHope in the Senate?\nBut representatives from multinational corporations to mid-size businesses and sizable trade associations are now looking to the U.S. Senate to restore measures that they say created a boom time for investment, production and new energy on the grid.\nJeannie Salo, chief public policy officer at Schneider Electric, said in a statement to States Newsroom that \u201cThe Senate should restore and extend the timelines for key energy and manufacturing credits and their transferability to ensure the nation continues to attract key investments and projects that will power the U.S. economy and help make energy more affordable.\u201d\nPederson said the restrictions on foreign components and company ties are \u201cparticularly restrictive coming out of the House.\u201d\n\u201cSo we\u2019re hoping to work with the Senate Finance Committee and some of the members of the Senate who have indicated some willingness to make the foreign entity of concern language a little bit more workable,\u201d Pederson said.\nDoffling believes senators have a \u201clonger term vision\u201d of the nation\u2019s energy strategy than House members who face reelection every two years.\n\u201cThey see what\u2019s happening not just in their district, but in the entire state that they represent,\u201d Doffling said.\nThe House bill just sets the U.S. \u201cfurther behind,\u201d he added. \u201cThis bill is all about going backwards in time and hoping for the best.\u201d\n\u201cI wish they could look at the numbers and understand the economic impacts it\u2019s gonna have. \u2026 But somehow we\u2019re talking about the fact of hamstringing a whole entire industry itself over verbiage of the word \u2018clean.\u2019\u201d\nLast updated 2:47 p.m., Jun. 9, 2025\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

Senate Republicans double down and target clean energy in draft tax bill\nA proposal by Senate Republicans would adjust the pace at which some crucial home energy efficiency and electric vehicle tax credits are phased out in timelines different from what House Republicans proposed in the multitrillion-dollar tax bill they pa...\nTax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency would still be phased out, albeit less quickly, under Senate Republicans' latest proposed changes to a massive tax bill. Electric vehicle incentives and other provisions intended to move the United States away from fossil fuels would be gutted rapidly.\nSenate Republicans cast their version of the bill as less damaging to the clean energy industry than the version House Republicans passed last month, but Democrats and advocates criticized it, saying it would still have significant consequences for wind, solar and other projects.\nUltimately, wherever Congress ends up could have a big impact on consumers, companies and others that were depending on tax credits for green energy investments. It could also impact long-term how quickly America transitions to renewable energies.\n\u201cThey want everybody to believe that after the flawed House bill, that they have come up with a much more moderate climate approach,\" said Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the finance committee, during a conference call with reporters Tuesday.\n\u201cThe reality is, if the early projections on the clean energy cuts are accurate, the Senate Republican bill does almost 90%\" as much damage as the House proposal, added Wyden, who authored clean energy tax credits included in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act passed during former President Joe Biden\u2019s term. \u201cLet\u2019s not get too serious about this new Senate bill being a kinder, gentler approach.\u201d\nThe Edison Electric Institute, a trade association representing investor-owned electric companies, issued a statement applauding the Senate proposal for including \u201cmore reasonable timelines for phasing out energy tax credits.\u201d\n\u201cThese modifications are a step in the right direction,\u201d said the statement from Pat Vincent-Collawn, the institute\u2019s interim chief executive officer, adding that the changes balance \u201cbusiness certainty with fiscal responsibility.\u201d\nWhether all of the changes will be enacted into law isn't clear yet. The Senate can still modify its proposals before they go to a vote. Any conflicts in the draft legislation will have to be sorted out with the House as the GOP looks to fast-track the bill for a vote by President Donald Trump\u2019s imminent Fourth of July target.\nNotably, many Republicans in Congress have advocated to protect the clean-energy credits, which have overwhelmingly benefited Republican congressional districts. A report by the Atlas Public Policy research firm found that 77% of planned spending on credit-eligible projects are in GOP-held House districts.\nThe clean energy tax credits stem from Biden\u2019s climate law, which aimed to boost to the nation\u2019s transition away from planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions and toward renewable energy such as wind and solar power.\nThe House version of the bill took an ax to many of the credits and effectively made it impossible for wind and solar providers to meet the requirements and timelines necessary to qualify for the incentives. After the House vote, 13 House Republicans lobbied the Senate to preserve some of the clean energy incentives that GOP lawmakers had voted to erase.\nLanguage included Monday in the reconciliation bill from the Senate Finance Committee would still phase out \u2014 though more slowly than House lawmakers envisioned \u2014 some Biden-era green energy tax breaks.\nThe Senate proposal further \u201cachieves significant savings by slashing Green New Deal spending and targeting waste, fraud and abuse in spending programs while preserving and protecting them for the most vulnerable,\u201d said Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho and chairman of the committee.\nOn the chopping block are tax credits for residential rooftop solar installations, ending within 180 days of passage, and a subsidy for hydrogen production. Federal credits for wind and solar would have a longer phaseout than in the House version, but it would still be difficult for developers to meet the rules for beginning construction in order to receive the credit.\nAt the same time, it would boost support for geothermal, nuclear and hydropower projects that begin construction by 2033.\n\u201cThe bill will strip the ability of millions of American families to choose the energy savings, energy resilience, and energy freedom that solar and storage provide,\u201d said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association. \u201cIf this bill passes as is, we cannot ensure an affordable, reliable and secure energy system.\u201d\nOpponents of the Senate\u2019s text also decry domestic manufacturing job and economic losses as a result.\n\u201cThis is a 20-pound sledgehammer swung at clean energy. It would mean higher energy prices, lost manufacturing jobs, shuttered factories, and a worsening climate crisis,\u201d said Jackie Wong, senior vice president for climate and energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council.\nThe bill would also cancel incentives such as the Energy Efficient Home Improvement credit \u2014 which helps homeowners make improvements such as insulation or heating and cooling systems that reduce their energy usage and energy bills \u2014 180 days after enactment.

GM slow-rolls its all-EV aspirations\nThe automaker is putting more money into gas-powered cars, making it all but impossible to reach its goal of selling only electric vehicles by 2035.\nGeneral Motors quietly closed the door this week on a goal to make only electric vehicles by 2035.\nThe automaker announced Tuesday that it would spend $4 billion on mostly gasoline-powered vehicles. While GM is not retreating from EVs, the investment means the company is \u201cgiving up any hope of achieving that [2035] goal,\u201d said Sam Abuelsamid, an auto analyst at Telemetry, a Detroit-area research firm.\nAsked Wednesday whether the goal still exists, GM said in a statement, \u201cWe still believe in an all-EV future.\u201d\nGM\u2019s move away from the 2035 goal is less a singular failure and more a symptom of flagging support among many actors, including government, other automakers, charging companies and car buyers, analysts said.\nMuch has changed since GM set the EV target, just after President Joe Biden took office and amid a surge of confidence in the auto industry about widespread EV adoption. Four years later, the Trump administration is dismantling Biden-era federal support for EVs and implementing high tariffs, upsetting automakers\u2019 production plans.\nThose federal moves, combined with a cooling desire for EVs among car buyers, has moved the sunset date for the internal combustion engine to a vague someday.\nGM is still ramping up EV production. Earlier this week, it trumpeted the fact that it sold 37,000 EVs in the first quarter of the year, making it the number two EV maker in the U.S. behind Tesla.\nThe company\u2019s 2035 goal \u201cwas aspirational. It was more an idea than a strategy,\u201d said Alan Baum, an independent Detroit auto analyst. \u201cGM\u2019s doing a better job than many of their competitors, but there\u2019s obviously a relatively low ceiling because of the lack of supportive policy.\u201d\nGM\u2019s all-EV goal back in 2021 was one of the earliest and most prominent of a wave of automaker commitments to electric vehicles. At the time, GM CEO Mary Barra encouraged others to \u201cfollow suit and make a significant impact on our industry and on the economy as a whole.\u201d\nOthers did follow \u2014 and all of those promises have been tempered by new realities.\nLast year, European automakers Volvo, Porsche, Volkswagen and Mercedes all dropped earlier goals that would have seen them producing all or mostly EVs by the early 2030s.\nBack in 2021, GM also put an asterisk on its 2035 target.\n\u201cWe say it as an aspirational goal, because to actually make that timing, we need some external things to come together also,\u201d spokesperson Jessica James said at the time.\nBarra reiterated last month that the company still wants an \u201call-EV future.\u201d\n\u201cEVs are fundamentally better,\u201d she said at a Wall Street Journal event late last month. \u201cWe have work to do to continue to get battery technology to give us greater density, so we have farther range. We need to have a robust charging infrastructure.\u201d\nAutomakers, including GM, have been mostly mum in public as the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress seek to kill tax incentives that make it cheaper for manufacturers to produce batteries and consumers to buy EVs.\nBut through the main U.S. automotive lobby, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, automakers have vociferously opposed California\u2019s plans to require all-electric auto sales by 2035.\nThe Republican-controlled Congress voted to kill that California 2035 all-EV sales goal \u2014 the same one that GM first set for itself \u2014 through the Congressional Review Act. The move came after the Senate parliamentarian told lawmakers they couldn\u2019t repeal the goal through the CRA.\nThe bill awaits a signature by Trump, after which the California attorney general has pledged to sue.\nWhat GM is doing\nGM\u2019s announcement that it would invest $4 billion in domestic manufacturing essentially shuffles production among factories in ways that will help the company dodge Trump\u2019s tariffs.\nIt is moving production of about a half-million gasoline-powered vehicles from Mexico to factories in the U.S., according to an analysis by Abuelsamid of Telemetry. Doing so will enable GM to avoid 25 percent tariffs that the Trump administration has placed on vehicles imported from Mexico.\nFor example, the production of several full-size SUVs and pickup trucks will transfer to GM\u2019s Orion plant, north of Detroit. The gas-powered Equinox, a strong U.S. seller, will move to the Fairfax plant in Kansas City. The gas-running Blazer will go to the company\u2019s Spring Hill plant in Tennessee.\nMeanwhile, EV production will be concentrated at GM\u2019s Factory Zero, a dedicated EV plant in metro Detroit that is running far below capacity. That plant will continue making the electric Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra, alongside other large EVs made in low volumes, including the Cadillac Escalade IQ and the Hummer.\nOther EVs will be made elsewhere. Other electric Cadillacs, for example, will be made at the Spring Hill plant, while a rebooted version of the Chevy Bolt will be produced at the Fairfax plant, which the company described as the site for the \u201cnext generation of affordable EVs.\u201d\nThose changes, combined with other recent moves, make it clear that GM is laying the groundwork to produce gas-powered vehicles well into the 2030s.\nIn May, the Detroit automaker said it would ditch plans to make electric motors at its Towanda Production plant in Buffalo, New York, and instead spend $888 million to make V-8 engines.\nIn 2023, GM put $579 million toward refurbishing an engine plant in Flint, Michigan. Electric vehicles don\u2019t have engines \u2014 they rely instead on batteries for propulsion.\nEngine factories are large, fixed investments that are meant to operate for 15 years or more, according to Neal Ganguli, a managing director and auto-manufacturing expert at the business advisory firm AlixPartners.\nMeanwhile, the manufacturing lines that make finished cars \u2014 like the ones GM unveiled this week \u2014 have shorter but still lengthy lives.\n\u201cWhen you put these [manufacturing lines] in, you are planning on a five- to seven-year time horizon,\u201d Ganguli said. \u201cMaybe 10 years.\u201d\nAnalysts said General Motors\u2019 swerve back into the gasoline lane \u2014 and away from the path to all EVs by 2035 \u2014 is not a surprise, given the market and policy realities.\n\u201cIt was always a long shot at best,\u201d said Abuelsamid."]}, {"topic": 27, "name": "Trump's Military Parade and National Protests", "keywords": "parade, army, military, birthday, the, trump, armys, of, soldiers, 250th", "documents": ["Army parade, Trump birthday take over D.C., as \u2018No Kings\u2019 protests erupt across nation. 17:06\nrepublished\nArmy parade, Trump birthday take over D.C., as \u2018No Kings\u2019 protests erupt across nation\nU.S. President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump stand together at the end of the U.S Army parade on June 14, 2025 in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)\nThis report has been updated.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump on Saturday celebrated his 79th birthday reviewing a parade of tanks, armament and marching soldiers gathered in the nation\u2019s capital for the Army\u2019s 250th anniversary celebration, amid heightened political tensions across the country and anti-Trump \u201cNo Kings\u201d protests.\nThe nearly 90-minute parade cycled through the Army\u2019s history, beginning with soldiers marching in Revolutionary War uniforms and ending with symbols of the Army\u2019s future, including small robots carrying the U.S. Army flag and new West Point cadets about to be sworn in.\nMassive tactical vehicles rolled down Constitution Avenue one after another. Sherman tanks used by the military in World War II were followed by early 2000s-era howitzers and HIMARS, or High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, that can launch newly developed precision missiles that reach up to 310 miles away, according to the Army.\nHIMARS were among the weaponry the U.S. provided to Ukraine\u2019s forces under President Joe Biden.\n\u201cThe Army keeps us free,\u201d Trump said in brief remarks at the conclusion of the parade, after Vice President J.D. Vance introduced him. \u201cEvery other country celebrates their victories, it\u2019s about time America did too. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing tonight.\u201d\nBut tragedy and deep conflict marked the hours and days leading to the event. Early Saturday, a Minnesota Democratic state lawmaker and her husband were assassinated in their home in an \u201cact of political violence,\u201d said Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, while another legislator and his wife were shot and gravely wounded.\nLate Friday, dozens of veterans breached barricades around the U.S. Capitol in protest of the Army parade. On Thursday, a Democratic U.S. senator from California was handcuffed and forcibly removed from a press conference with the head of Homeland Security.\nLast weekend, multi-day protests erupted in Los Angeles after immigration raids swept across several Home Depots, typically where undocumented day laborers search for work, as Trump\u2019s mass deportations continue to be carried out.\nAnd the president is in a legal standoff with California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, after Trump ordered more than 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines to be sent to LA without Newsom\u2019s consent and Newsom sued. The Guard troops remained in LA Saturday after a federal appeals court froze a lower court\u2019s order directing Trump to return command to Newsom.\nThe city saw a large protest Saturday afternoon, according to local media reports. A curfew of 8 p.m. Pacific time remained in effect, Mayor Karen Bass\u2019 office said in a morning press release.\nAnd on Saturday night, the Salt Lake City Police Department said it was investigating a shooting that occurred during a \u201cNo Kings\u201d protest and officials urged people to disperse the demonstration.\n\u2018Yeah, I wanna be there\u2019\nIn Washington, spectators from across the country began lining barriers along the Army parade route hours before the event\u2019s start.\nScott Aiken, 59, of Athens, Georgia, drove 10 hours for the parade. Aiken, who told States Newsroom he voted for Trump in the last three presidential elections, said he wanted to support the anniversary of the Army.\n\u201cMy father was in the Army, and my wife\u2019s father was in the Army, and we\u2019re a supportive military family. And when I heard the parade was going to happen, I thought, \u2018Yeah, I wanna be there.\u2019 So we drove up from Athens on Thursday, and did the Capitol tour yesterday, and here we are.\u201d\nWhen asked about the timing of Trump\u2019s birthday, Aiken said \u201cwhether it\u2019s on his birthday or not, I don\u2019t care. That\u2019s not the purpose of this.\u201d\nMembers of Trump\u2019s Cabinet and other allies on social media posted well wishes and greetings. \u201cWishing a very happy birthday to our incredible President Donald J. Trump!\u201d Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem posted on X. Trump said on his social media site, Truth Social, \u201cPresident Putin called this morning to very nicely wish me a Happy Birthday, but to more importantly, talk about Iran,\u201d referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin and a recent attack by Israel on Iran\u2019s military leaders.\nNot everyone at the parade was wishing Trump well. Angelica Zetino, 24, and Shoshauna Brooks, 27, from Rockville and Gaithersburg, Maryland, stood out among the crowd as they carried signs protesting Trump\u2019s administration, particularly recent immigration raids.\nThe pair began their morning at a \u201cNo Kings\u201d protest in Rockville before heading to D.C.\n\u201cThey (the administration) just want to put on a show, which is OK, but we\u2019re here to support the people that can\u2019t have a voice for themselves,\u201d Brooks said.\nTom Moore, 57, of the District of Columbia,, took issue with Trump\u2019s words this week that any parade protesters would be met with force.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not acceptable. He didn\u2019t say violent protesters. I wasn\u2019t planning on coming down here before that,\u201d said Moore.\nTrump told reporters in the Oval Office on June 10 that any protests at the military parade \u201cwill be met with very heavy force.\u201d\nRallies opposing Trump\nThroughout Saturday, protests unfolded across the U.S. bearing the theme \u201cNo Kings\u201d to decry Trump\u2019s military display on his own birthday and the mass immigration arrests.\nThe \u201cNo Kings\u201d national organizers said in a press release that as of 2 p.m. Eastern, protesters had rallied at more than 1,500 sites across the country, with 600 more events scheduled through the rest of the day. \u201cNo Kings\u201d was organized by liberal groups and labor unions including Indivisible, the American Federation of Teachers, American Civil Liberties Union, Public Citizen, MoveOn, 50501, Interfaith Alliance, Stand Up America, Common Defense, Human Rights Campaign and League of Conservation Voters.\nApproximately 60 protesters were arrested outside the U.S. Capitol Friday evening, according to the U.S. Capitol Police. Veterans for Peace, a group that organized the demonstration, posted photos of the arrests and of several demonstrators wearing \u201cVeterans Against Fascists\u201d t-shirts.\nPolice said 75 people peacefully demonstrated outside of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\u201cA short time later, approximately 60 people from the group left the Supreme Court so as a precaution, our officers began establishing a perimeter,\u201d a police spokesperson told States Newsroom in an email. \u201cA few people pushed the bike rack down and illegally crossed the police line while running towards the Rotunda Steps. Our officers immediately blocked the group and began making arrests.\u201d\nAmong those arrested was an elderly Vietnam veteran using a walker, Capitol Police confirmed.\nTwo mules and a dog\nA trickle of red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats and apparel displaying support for the Army intermingled as supporters shuffled into the parade grounds Saturday afternoon.\nThe parade featured soldiers from every division, 150 vehicles, 50 aircraft, 34 horses, two mules and one dog, at a price tag in the tens of millions of dollars, according to the Army.\nAmong the vehicles and equipment that rolled down Constitution Avenue between 15th and 23rd streets were Abrams tanks, first used in 1991 for Operation Desert Storm; and 9,500-pound titanium M777 lightweight Howitzers that fire 105-pound shells up to 24 miles and are currently in use on Ukraine\u2019s battlefields.\nMilitary aircraft that could be seen above Washington in ceremonial flyovers, from AH-64 Apaches, UH-60 Blackhawks and CH-47 Chinooks. Army Golden Knights parachuted down to the White House South Lawn, red smoke in their wake, to present Trump with a folded flag. The president has never served in the military.\nD.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser expressed concern in the weeks leading up to the parade about the heavy tactical vehicles causing damage to the city\u2019s streets. The Army Corps of Engineers had installed large steel plates ahead of the event to reinforce the roads.\nThe parade coincided with the Army\u2019s 250th birthday celebration festival, which has been in the works for a year.\nThe parade appears to have been a late addition to the festivities. According to documentation obtained by local D.C. news outlet WTOP, America250 applied on March 31 for a permit for the parade. A May 21 press release about the parade from America250, which describes itself as a \u201cnonprofit supporting organization to the U.S. Semiquincentennial Commission,\u201d celebrated Trump\u2019s role in the event.\nTrump wanted a military parade during his first term, but the idea was dismissed because of cost, NBC reported at the time.\nThe last time the U.S. staged a celebratory military parade was in 1991 under former President George H.W. Bush to recognize the victory in the first Gulf War.\nImmigration enforcement and military\nThe big Army celebration early in Trump\u2019s second term came as the president has intertwined the U.S. military with his immigration policy, as shown in LA and elsewhere.\nIn his first days in office, Trump signed five executive orders that laid out the use of military forces within the U.S. borders and extended other executive powers to speed up the president\u2019s immigration crackdown.\nHe\u2019s directed the Department of Defense to use a naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba to detain migrants. Military planes have been used in deportations \u2013 rather than standard commercial airplanes.\nIn April, he signed a proclamation creating a military buffer zone that stretches across Arizona, California and New Mexico just north of the U.S.-Mexico border. It means any migrant crossing into the United States would be trespassing on a military base, therefore allowing active-duty troops to hold them until U.S. Border Patrol agents arrive.\nNational and military experts have raised concerns that giving control over the Roosevelt Reservation to the military could violate the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 law that generally prohibits the military from being used in domestic law enforcement. A statutory exception in the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, is the Insurrection Act of 1807.\nTrump has considered invoking the Insurrection Act, but has stopped short. The Insurrection Act is an existing presidential authority that would grant the president access to use all federal military forces, more than 1 million members.\nThe Insurrection Act has only been invoked 30 times, and is typically focused on an area of great civil unrest that has overwhelmed law enforcement.\nThe last time a president used it was 1992, during the Los Angeles riots, after four white police officers were acquitted in the brutal beating of Black motorist Rodney King.\nIn calling in the National Guard in LA last week, Trump cited a rarely used statute known as the protective power \u2013 10 U.S.C. 12406 \u2013 to use National Guard troops to protect federal personnel and property, but not for broad law enforcement functions.\nLast updated 9:33 p.m., Jun. 14, 2025\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

The event planned for Saturday will mark the U.S. Army\u2019s 250th birthday, with thousands of soldiers and dozens of massive military vehicles and aircraft descending on the National Mall. The estimated cost: up to $45 million. Trump has reportedly long sought this kind of celebration. Eight years ago, he witnessed France\u2019s Bastille Day parade and said the United States is \u201cgoing to have to try and top it.\u201d \u201cFor two and a half centuries, our brave soldiers have fought, bled, and died to keep us FREE, and now we will honor them with a wonderful Parade, one that is worthy of their service and sacrifice,\u201d the president, who is expected to attend the parade, said on his Truth Social account late last month. Army spokesperson Heather Hagan called the celebration a \u201conce-in-a-lifetime\u201d occasion. \u201cThis is America\u2019s Army,\u201d she told PBS News. \u201cIt\u2019s a free festival, free parade, free opportunity for all to participate in and come meet your Army.\u201d Joggers pass the parade viewing stand on June 13 in front of the White House ahead of the upcoming U.S. Army 250th anniversary celebration in Washington, D.C. Photo by Kevin Lamarque/Reuters Military parades of this scale are uncommon in the U.S. The last one happened decades ago, in 1991, to celebrate the American and allied forces\u2019 victory in the first Gulf War. Trump has gotten political blowback over the parade, including from Democrats who say the event is to celebrate himself. (The president\u2019s 79th birthday is on Saturday). Veterans are divided over the parade, with some viewing the military parade as a commemoration of the institution\u2019s history. Others have balked at the parade\u2019s price tag and how the event papers over the Trump administration\u2019s cuts to the Department of Veterans Affairs and an ongoing effort to remove transgender troops from service. Roughly 6 in 10 U.S. adults, including 80% of Democrats, 72% of independents and 35% of Republicans, said the military parade was not a good use of government money, according to a poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research earlier this month. \u201cIt\u2019s his typical personalization of national life \u2014 it\u2019s all about him, it\u2019s all about his ego, it\u2019s all about his prominence, his success at becoming president of the United States,\u201d said Richard Kohn, an emeritus professor of history and peace, war and defense at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \u201cTo adopt the military for political and egotistical terms is really, to me, a mark of weakness \u2014 weakness of his self-regard, weakness of his position in American life, and it diminishes the importance of the Army\u2019s 250 years of success.\u201d People hold a banner on June 13 that reads, \u201cHappy Birthday President Trump\u201d as preparations continue ahead of the upcoming U.S. Army 250th anniversary celebration parade, near the White House in Washington, D.C. Photo by Carlos Barria/Reuters Peter Feaver, a political science and public policy professor at Duke University, said that while a parade like this is unusual, there is something \u201cdeeper\u201d and \u201clegitimate\u201d worth celebrating. \u201cThis is a chance to remind the American people that, for 250 years, America\u2019s freedoms have been protected by men and women who are willing to serve and answer the call of duty when they\u2019re called. That\u2019s partly why we have the free republic we have today that\u2019s worth celebrating,\u201d he said. \u201cWith that in mind, that goes a long way to mollifying some of the concerns I think people might otherwise have.\u201d When and where is Trump\u2019s military parade happening? The parade kicks off at 6:30 p.m. Eastern on Saturday as part of the U.S. Army\u2019s 250th birthday celebration on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. The parade is scheduled to start at 23rd Street NW, near the Lincoln Memorial, and travel approximately 1 mile east along Constitution Avenue to 15th Street NW, near the Ellipse in front of the White House. The parade is set to last around one hour. Latest forecasts show rain and possible thunderstorms in D.C. on the day of the parade. The Army said the weather \u201cis being closely monitored and taken into consideration, but at this point nothing has changed.\u201d Who will attend? Trump and Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll are expected to be among the VIPs in attendance. While the Army has not made a list of attendees publicly available, the White House\u2019s Instagram page includes a video from Army veteran and retired mixed martial arts fighter Tim Kennedy, who shares where Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth will be standing during the parade. Why is the military parade being held on June 14? The Army calls June 14, 1775, the official date of its establishment. The Second Continental Congress adopted a resolution on that day that called for \u201csix companies of expert riflemen, be immediately raised in Pennsylvania, two in Maryland, and two in Virginia\u201d to join a New England regional army, called the Army of Observation, near Boston, according to the transcribed journals of the Continental Congress available through the Library of Congress. About two weeks later, \u201con the 3rd of July, George Washington makes it up there and assumes command of what is now called the Continental Army,\u201d made up of the units established on June 14 and the Army of Observation, said Lee Reynolds, the public affairs officer for the U.S. Army Center of Military History. June 14 is also Flag Day, a commemoration of the day in 1777 when the Continental Congress decided what the official American flag would look like. How many troops are participating in the parade?

Photo by Nathan Howard/Reuters Some 6,700 soldiers will take part in the parade, representing different eras and units from the Army\u2019s history. Many of the troops will be dressed in historic and present-day uniforms, and be accompanied by equipment and vehicles from those eras. For instance, as soldiers representing the 82d and 101st Airborne divisions from World War II march down Constitution Ave., at least one Ford GPW 1/4 Ton Jeep and one M4A1 Sherman tank are expected to ride alongside them. Aircraft from that era \u2013 the B-25 Mitchell bomber, P-51 Mustang and C-47 Skytrain transport plane \u2013 will fly over the parade. The parade will also include the Army\u2019s parachute team, the Golden Knights, jumping onto the Ellipse in front of the White House. Future members of the military will also be included. Cadets at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, those in Army basic training and students in ROTC programs at Virginia Military Institute, the Citadel and Texas A&M University will march with people who are getting ready to enlist in the Army. How many tanks and aircraft will take part in the parade? The Defense Department, writing in May about preparations for the parade, noted that \u201cofficials anticipate approximately 150 vehicles\u201d and \u201c50 aircraft\u201d will take part in the parade. Included in the Army\u2019s list of equipment for the parade: the M1A2/Abrams tank, UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter, Bradley Fighting Vehicle and AH-64 Apache helicopter. The birthday celebration festival will be located on a stretch of the National Mall near the Smithsonian Castle. It will also include equipment on display, including drones. How much will the festival and parade cost? The entire day of festivities is expected to cost between $25 million and $45 million, Hagan told PBS News. During a House Armed Services Committee hearing last week, Driscoll said the parade offers an opportunity to boost recruitment. \u201cOur marketing budget we would spend to recruit those soldiers, I think our team believes that the investment of these dollars to tell that story will directly lead to a good, measurable, quantitative outcome for the Army,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be a massive tragedy to let this moment pass where we can tell this story and inculcate an entire generation of youth into this amazing story that is the United States Army.\u201d How are federal and D.C. officials preparing for the event?

Photo by Kevin Lamarque/Reuters The parade is a National Security Special Event, the highest federal security designation. This means it is getting the same security treatment as the Super Bowl, Trump\u2019s inauguration, and the state funeral of the late President Jimmy Carter. \u201cWe\u2019re preparing for an enormous turnout \u2014 hundreds of thousands of attendees,\u201d Matt McCool, the special agent-in-charge for the U.S. Secret Service\u2019s Washington, D.C., field office, said at a security briefing on Monday. Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport said in a statement that the Federal Aviation Administration \u201cis expected to suspend airline operations\u201d at the airport, the closest to the National Mall and the site of a deadly collision between a military helicopter and a commercial flight earlier this year. \u201cCustomers with flight reservations for the evening of June 14 should check the status of their flights directly with their airline,\u201d the statement read. The Army Corps of Engineers is using temporary metal plates and soft asphalt, held down with railroad ties, at key places along the parade route to mitigate damage caused by tanks and other vehicles. \u201cPart of our contract here is to, when this is done, to remove these plates, to remove the asphalt, and to return every place on the roadway that we put these down back to exactly what it was before,\u201d Col. Jesse Curry, director of the Office of the Chief of Engineers, said in a video posted on the Corps website. \u201cOnce the parade is complete, we want to return these roadways fully to the D.C. commuters and all those that use these roads to get to and from work and to visit our capital city.\u201d Curry also noted during the Monday security briefing that the tanks have new rubber track pads to minimize any damage to the road.

Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images As protests against the Trump administration\u2019s immigration raids continued in Los Angeles and other cities across the country, federal law enforcement officials said Monday they were monitoring and preparing for possible unrest if it happens near the parade and festival. \u201cWe have no intelligence about that happening here. But if it does, we have the resources to handle it,\u201d McCool said. Several cities across the nation will be the sites of \u201cNo Kings\u201d protests against the Trump administration on Saturday. But protest organizers said there will not be a demonstration in Washington, D.C. \u201cInstead of allowing this birthday parade to be the center of gravity, we will make action everywhere else the story of America that day: people coming together in communities across the country to reject strongman politics and corruption,\u201d the movement wrote on its website. While there is no specific designated zone for protests and First Amendment activity, the National Park Service has several permits pending, and, thus far, there have been no significant concerns, U.S. Park Police Chief Jessica Taylor told reporters Monday. Meanwhile, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday that \u201cthose people who want to protest\u201d are \u201cgoing to be met with very big force.\u201d When was the last time the U.S. held a similar military parade? On June 8, 1991, approximately 200,000 people gathered on the National Mall for a parade to celebrate the United States\u2019 and its allies\u2019 victory in the Gulf War. The New York Times reported the next day that the parade was \u201cthe largest military exhibition in the capital\u201d since Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Allied commander during World War II, led a parade down Pennsylvania Avenue after the war ended. The newspaper also called the celebration \u201cthe most impressive display of war technology in recent history.\u201d Kohn said that parade had a reason behind it \u2013 the \u201castounding\u201d victory in Operation Desert Storm. The U.S. does military parades \u201cto build morale and to build a kind of showcase for the military to the American people. But it has to be done carefully. It has to be done tastefully. It has to be done economically,\u201d he said. \u201cBut to make a splash with it that\u2019s corrupted by the president of the United States\u2019 age and birthday, strikes many of us as both inappropriate and ridiculous.\u201d Dan Sagalyn contributed reporting for this story.

The event planned for Saturday will mark the U.S. Army\u2019s 250th birthday, with thousands of soldiers and dozens of massive military vehicles and aircraft descending on the National Mall. The estimated cost: up to $45 million. Trump has reportedly long sought this kind of celebration. Eight years ago, he witnessed France\u2019s Bastille Day parade and said the United States is \u201cgoing to have to try and top it.\u201d \u201cFor two and a half centuries, our brave soldiers have fought, bled, and died to keep us FREE, and now we will honor them with a wonderful Parade, one that is worthy of their service and sacrifice,\u201d the president, who is expected to attend the parade, said on his Truth Social account late last month. Army spokesperson Heather Hagan called the celebration a \u201conce-in-a-lifetime\u201d occasion. \u201cThis is America\u2019s Army,\u201d she told PBS News. \u201cIt\u2019s a free festival, free parade, free opportunity for all to participate in and come meet your Army.\u201d Joggers pass the parade viewing stand on June 13 in front of the White House ahead of the upcoming U.S. Army 250th anniversary celebration in Washington, D.C. Photo by Kevin Lamarque/Reuters Military parades of this scale are uncommon in the U.S. The last one happened decades ago, in 1991, to celebrate the American and allied forces\u2019 victory in the first Gulf War. Trump has gotten political blowback over the parade, including from Democrats who say the event is to celebrate himself. (The president\u2019s 79th birthday is on Saturday). Veterans are divided over the parade, with some viewing the military parade as a commemoration of the institution\u2019s history.

Watch the parade and celebration in our video player above. The Republican president, on his 79th birthday, sat on a special viewing stand south of the White House to watch the display of American military might, which began early and moved swiftly as light rain fell and clouds shrouded the Washington Monument. The procession, with more than 6,000 soldiers and 128 Army tanks, was one Trump tried to make happen in his first term after seeing such an event in Paris in 2017, but the plans never came together until the parade was added to an event recognizing the Army\u2019s 250th anniversary. \u201cEvery other country celebrates their victories. It\u2019s about time America did too,\u201d Trump declared in brief remarks at the parade\u2019s end. The president praised the strength of the military\u2019s fighting forces and said U.S. soldiers \u201cfight, fight fight and they win, win win\u201d \u2014 putting a new twist on a line that Trump regularly delivered during his 2024 campaign rallies after he survived an assassination attempt. Early in the evening\u2019s pageantry, the Army\u2019s Golden Knights parachute team descended from overcast skies toward the reviewing stand. The team had been scheduled to appear at the end of the parade, but jumped earlier than planned in the drizzly skies above the National Mall. At times, Trump stood and saluted as troops marched past the reviewing stand. But attendance appeared to fall far short of early predictions that as many as 200,000 people would attend the festival and parade. There were large gaps between viewers near the Washington Monument on a day when steamy weather and the threat of thunderstorms could have dampened turnout.

They criticized Trump for using the military to respond to people protesting his deportation efforts and for the muscular military show in the U.S. capital. Displays of military might The daylong display of America\u2019s Army came as Trump has shown his willingness to use the nation\u2019s military might in ways other U.S. presidents have typically avoided. In the last week, he has activated the California National Guard over the governor\u2019s objections and dispatched the U.S. Marines to provide security during Los Angeles protests related to immigration raids, prompting a state lawsuit to stop the deployments. READ MORE: What U.S. law says about Trump\u2019s deployment of active duty troops to Los Angeles As armored vehicles rolled down the street in front of the president, on the other side of the country, the Marines who Trump deployed to Los Angeles appeared at a demonstration for the first time, standing guard outside a federal building. Dozens of Marines stood shoulder to shoulder in full combat gear beside the National Guard, Homeland Security officers and other law enforcement. Hundreds of protesters facing them jeered in English and Spanish, telling the troops to go home. A previously calm demonstration in downtown Los Angeles turned chaotic when police on horseback charged at the crowd, striking some with rods and batons as they cleared the street in front of the federal building and fired tear gas and crowd control projectiles. In Washington, hundreds protesting Trump carried signs with messages that included \u201cWhere\u2019s the due process?\u201d and \u201cNo to Trump\u2019s fascist military parade\u201d as they marched toward the White House. A larger-than-life puppet of Trump was wheeled through the crowd, a caricature of the president wearing a crown and sitting on a golden toilet. WATCH: Millions turn out nationwide for \u2018No Kings\u2019 protests against Trump administration Other protesters waved pride flags and hoisted signs, some with pointed messages such as \u201cI prefer crushed ICE,\u201d referring to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. Other messages included \u201cThe invasion was HERE Jan. 6th, NOT in L.A.\u201d and \u201cFlip me off if you\u2019re a FASCIST.\u201d \u201cNo Kings\u201d rallies unfolded in hundreds of cities, designed to counter what organizers said were Trump\u2019s plans to feed his ego on his 79th birthday and Flag Day. Organizers said they picked the name to support democracy and speak out against what they call the authoritarian actions of the Trump administration.

Price, Associated Press Michelle L. Price, Associated Press\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The grand military parade that President Donald Trump had been wanting for years barreled down Constitution Avenue on Saturday with tanks, troops and a 21-gun salute, playing out against a counterpoint of protests around the country by those who decried the U.S. leader as a dictator and would-be king. Watch the parade and celebration in our video player above. The Republican president, on his 79th birthday, sat on a special viewing stand south of the White House to watch the display of American military might, which began early and moved swiftly as light rain fell and clouds shrouded the Washington Monument. The procession, with more than 6,000 soldiers and 128 Army tanks, was one Trump tried to make happen in his first term after seeing such an event in Paris in 2017, but the plans never came together until the parade was added to an event recognizing the Army\u2019s 250th anniversary. \u201cEvery other country celebrates their victories. It\u2019s about time America did too,\u201d Trump declared in brief remarks at the parade\u2019s end. The president praised the strength of the military\u2019s fighting forces and said U.S. soldiers \u201cfight, fight fight and they win, win win\u201d \u2014 putting a new twist on a line that Trump regularly delivered during his 2024 campaign rallies after he survived an assassination attempt. Early in the evening\u2019s pageantry, the Army\u2019s Golden Knights parachute team descended from overcast skies toward the reviewing stand. The team had been scheduled to appear at the end of the parade, but jumped earlier than planned in the drizzly skies above the National Mall. At times, Trump stood and saluted as troops marched past the reviewing stand. But attendance appeared to fall far short of early predictions that as many as 200,000 people would attend the festival and parade. There were large gaps between viewers near the Washington Monument on a day when steamy weather and the threat of thunderstorms could have dampened turnout.

They criticized Trump for using the military to respond to people protesting his deportation efforts and for the muscular military show in the U.S. capital. Displays of military might The daylong display of America\u2019s Army came as Trump has shown his willingness to use the nation\u2019s military might in ways other U.S. presidents have typically avoided. In the last week, he has activated the California National Guard over the governor\u2019s objections and dispatched the U.S. Marines to provide security during Los Angeles protests related to immigration raids, prompting a state lawsuit to stop the deployments.

Dozens of Marines stood shoulder to shoulder in full combat gear beside the National Guard, Homeland Security officers and other law enforcement. Hundreds of protesters facing them jeered in English and Spanish, telling the troops to go home. A previously calm demonstration in downtown Los Angeles turned chaotic when police on horseback charged at the crowd, striking some with rods and batons as they cleared the street in front of the federal building and fired tear gas and crowd control projectiles. In Washington, hundreds protesting Trump carried signs with messages that included \u201cWhere\u2019s the due process?\u201d and \u201cNo to Trump\u2019s fascist military parade\u201d as they marched toward the White House. A larger-than-life puppet of Trump was wheeled through the crowd, a caricature of the president wearing a crown and sitting on a golden toilet. WATCH: Millions turn out nationwide for \u2018No Kings\u2019 protests against Trump administration Other protesters waved pride flags and hoisted signs, some with pointed messages such as \u201cI prefer crushed ICE,\u201d referring to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. Other messages included \u201cThe invasion was HERE Jan. 6th, NOT in L.A.\u201d and \u201cFlip me off if you\u2019re a FASCIST.\u201d \u201cNo Kings\u201d rallies unfolded in hundreds of cities, designed to counter what organizers said were Trump\u2019s plans to feed his ego on his 79th birthday and Flag Day. Organizers said they picked the name to support democracy and speak out against what they call the authoritarian actions of the Trump administration.

By \u2014 Hillel Italie, Associated Press Hillel Italie, Associated Press Leave your feedback Share Copy URL https://www.pbs.org/newshour/arts/brian-wilson-visionary-leader-of-the-beach-boys-dies-at-82 Email Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Tumblr Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Brian Wilson, visionary leader of the Beach Boys, dies at 82 Arts Jun 11, 2025 1:25 PM EDT Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys\u2019 visionary and fragile leader whose genius for melody, arrangements and wide-eyed self-expression inspired \u201cGood Vibrations,\u201d \u201cCalifornia Girls\u201d and other summertime anthems and made him one of the world\u2019s most influential recording artists, has died at 82. Wilson\u2019s family posted news of his death to his website and social media accounts Wednesday. Further details weren\u2019t immediately available. Since May 2024, Wilson had been under a court conservatorship to oversee his personal and medical affairs, with Wilson\u2019s longtime representatives, publicist Jean Sievers and manager LeeAnn Hard, in charge. The eldest and last surviving of three musical brothers \u2014 Brian played bass, Carl lead guitar and Dennis drums \u2014 he and his fellow Beach Boys rose in the 1960s from local California band to national hitmakers to international ambassadors of surf and sun. Wilson himself was celebrated for his gifts and pitied for his demons. He was one of rock\u2019s great Romantics, a tormented man who in his peak years embarked on an ever-steeper path to aural perfection, the one true sound. The Beach Boys rank among the most popular groups of the rock era, with more than 30 singles in the Top 40 and worldwide sales of more than 100 million. The 1966 album \u201cPet Sounds\u201d was voted No. 2 in a 2003 Rolling Stone list of the best 500 albums, losing out, as Wilson had done before, to the Beatles\u2019 \u201cSgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band.\u201d The Beach Boys, who also featured Wilson cousin Mike Love and childhood friend Al Jardine, were voted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988. Wilson feuded with Love over songwriting credits, but peers otherwise adored him beyond envy, from Elton John and Bruce Springsteen to Smokey Robinson and Carole King. The Who\u2019s drummer, Keith Moon, fantasized about joining the Beach Boys. Paul McCartney cited \u201cPet Sounds\u201d as a direct inspiration on the Beatles and the ballad \u201cGod Only Knows\u201d as among his favorite songs, often bringing him to tears. Wilson moved and fascinated fans and musicians long after he stopped having hits. In his later years, Wilson and a devoted entourage of younger musicians performed \u201cPet Sounds\u201d and his restored opus, \u201cSmile,\u201d before worshipful crowds in concert halls. Meanwhile, The Go-Go\u2019s, Lindsey Buckingham, Animal Collective and Janelle Mon\u00e1e were among a wide range of artists who emulated him, whether as a master of crafting pop music or as a pioneer of pulling it apart. An endless summer The Beach Boys\u2019 music was like an ongoing party, with Wilson as host and wallflower. He was a tall, shy man, partially deaf (allegedly because of beatings by his father, Murry Wilson), with a sweet, crooked grin, and he rarely touched a surfboard unless a photographer was around. But out of the lifestyle that he observed and such musical influences as Chuck Berry and the Four Freshmen, he conjured a golden soundscape \u2014 sweet melodies, shining harmonies, vignettes of beaches, cars and girls \u2014 that resonated across time and climates. Decades after its first release, a Beach Boys song can still conjure instant summer \u2014 the wake-up guitar riff that opens \u201cSurfin\u2019 USA\u201d; the melting vocals of \u201cDon\u2019t Worry Baby\u201d; the chants of \u201cfun, fun, fun\u201d or \u201cgood, good, GOOD, good vibrations\u201d; the behind-the-wheel chorus \u201c\u2019Round, \u2019round, get around, I get around.\u201d Beach Boys songs have endured from turntables and transistor radios to boom boxes and iPhones, or any device that could lay on a beach towel or be placed upright in the sand. The band\u2019s innocent appeal survived the group\u2019s increasingly troubled back story, whether Brian\u2019s many personal trials, the feuds and lawsuits among band members or the alcoholism of Dennis Wilson, who drowned in 1983. Brian Wilson\u2019s ambition raised the Beach Boys beyond the pleasures of their early hits and into a world transcendent, eccentric and destructive. They seemed to live out every fantasy, and many nightmares, of the California myth they helped create. From the suburbs to the national stage Brian Wilson was born June 20, 1942, two days after McCartney. His musical gifts were soon obvious, and as a boy he was playing piano and teaching his brothers to sing harmony. The Beach Boys started as a neighborhood act, rehearsing in Brian\u2019s bedroom and in the garage of their house in suburban Hawthorne, California. Surf music, mostly instrumental in its early years, was catching on locally: Dennis Wilson, the group\u2019s only real surfer, suggested they cash in. Brian and Love hastily wrote up their first single, \u201cSurfin,\u2019\u201d a minor hit released in 1961. They wanted to call themselves the Pendletones, in honor of a popular flannel shirt they wore in early publicity photos. But when they first saw the pressings for \u201cSurfin,\u2019\u201d they discovered the record label had tagged them \u201cThe Beach Boys.\u201d Other decisions were handled by their father, a musician of some frustration who hired himself as manager and holy terror. By mid-decade, Murry Wilson had been displaced and Brian, who had been running the band\u2019s recording sessions almost from the start, was in charge, making the Beach Boys the rare group of the time to work without an outside producer. Their breakthrough came in early 1963 with \u201cSurfin\u2019 USA,\u201d so closely modeled on Berry\u2019s \u201cSweet Little Sixteen\u201d that Berry successfully sued to get a songwriting credit. It was their first Top 10 hit and a boast to the nation: \u201cIf everybody had an ocean / across the USA / then everybody\u2019d be surfin,\u2019 / like Cali-for-nye-ay.\u201d From 1963-66, they were rarely off the charts, hitting No. 1 with \u201cI Get Around\u201d and \u201cHelp Me, Rhonda\u201d and narrowly missing with \u201cCalifornia Girls\u201d and \u201cFun, Fun, Fun.\u201d For television appearances, they wore candy-striped shirts and grinned as they mimed their latest hit, with a hot rod or surfboard nearby. READ MORE: This waltz is the unofficial soundtrack of floating through space. Soon it will beam through the cosmos Their music echoed private differences. Wilson often contrasted his own bright falsetto with Love\u2019s nasal, deadpan tenor. The extroverted Love was out front on the fast songs, but when it was time for a slow one, Brian took over. \u201cThe Warmth of the Sun\u201d was a song of despair and consolation that Wilson alleged \u2014 to some skepticism \u2014 he wrote the morning after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. \u201cDon\u2019t Worry Baby,\u201d a ballad equally intoxicating and heartbreaking, was a leading man\u2019s confession of doubt and dependence, an early sign of Brian\u2019s crippling anxieties. Stress and exhaustion led to a breakdown in 1964 and his retirement from touring, his place soon filled by Bruce Johnston, who remained with the group for decades. Wilson was an admirer of Phil Spector\u2019s \u201cWall of Sound\u201d productions and emulated him on Beach Boys tracks, adding sleigh bells to \u201cDance, Dance, Dance\u201d or arranging a mini-theme park of guitar, horns, percussion and organ as the overture to \u201cCalifornia Girls.\u201d By the mid-1960s, the Beach Boys were being held up as the country\u2019s answer to the Beatles, a friendly game embraced by each group, transporting pop music to the level of \u201cart\u201d and leaving Wilson a broken man. The Beach Boys vs. The Beatles The Beatles opened with \u201cRubber Soul,\u201d released in late 1965 and their first studio album made without the distractions of movies or touring. It was immediately praised as a major advance, the lyrics far more personal and the music far more subtle and sophisticated than such earlier hits as \u201cShe Loves You\u201d and \u201cA Hard Day\u2019s Night.\u201d Wilson would recall getting high and listening to the record for the first time, promising himself he would not only keep up with the British band, but top them. Wilson worked for months on what became \u201cPet Sounds,\u201d and months on the single \u201cGood Vibrations.\u201d He hired an outside lyricist, Tony Asher, and used various studios, with dozens of musicians and instruments ranging from violins to bongos to the harpsichord. The air seemed to cool on some tracks and the mood turn reflective, autumnal. From \u201cI Know There\u2019s an Answer\u201d to \u201cYou Still Believe in Me,\u201d many of the songs were ballads, reveries, brushstrokes of melody, culminating in the sonic wonders of \u201cGood Vibrations,\u201d a psychedelic montage that at times sounded as if recorded in outer space. The results were momentous, yet disappointing. \u201cGood Vibrations\u201d was the group\u2019s first million-seller and \u201cPet Sounds,\u201d which included the hits \u201cSloop John B\u201d and \u201cWouldn\u2019t It Be Nice,\u201d awed McCartney, John Lennon and Eric Clapton among others. Widely regarded as a new kind of rock LP, it was more suited to headphones than to the radio, a \u201cconcept\u201d album in which individual songs built to a unified experience, so elaborately crafted in the studio that \u201cPet Sounds\u201d couldn\u2019t be replicated live with the technology of the time. Wilson was likened not just to the Beatles, but to Mozart and George Gershwin, whose \u201cRhapsody in Blue\u201d had inspired him since childhood. But the album didn\u2019t chart as highly as previous Beach Boys releases and was treated indifferently by the U.S. record label, Capitol. The Beatles, meanwhile, were absorbing lessons from the Beach Boys and teaching some in return. \u201cRevolver\u201d and \u201cSgt. Pepper,\u201d the Beatles\u2019 next two albums, drew upon the Beach Boys\u2019 vocal tapestries and melodic bass lines and even upon the animal sounds from the title track of \u201cPet Sounds.\u201d The Beatles\u2019 epic \u201cA Day in the Life\u201d reconfirmed the British band as kings of the pop world and \u201cSgt. Pepper\u201d as the album to beat. All eyes turned to Wilson and his intended masterpiece \u2014 a \u201cteenage symphony to God\u201d he called \u201cSmile.\u201d It was a whimsical cycle of songs on nature and American folklore written with lyricist Van Dyke Parks. The production bordered on method acting; for a song about fire, Wilson wore a fire helmet in the studio. The other Beach Boys were confused, and strained to work with him. A shaken Wilson delayed \u201cSmile,\u201d then canceled it. Remnants, including the songs \u201cHeroes and Villains\u201d and \u201cWind Chimes\u201d were re-recorded and issued in September 1967 on \u201cSmiley Smile,\u201d dismissed by Carl Wilson as a \u201cbunt instead of a grand slam.\u201d The stripped down \u201cWild Honey,\u201d released three months later, became a critical favorite but didn\u2019t restore the band\u2019s reputation. The Beach Boys soon descended into an oldies act, out of touch with the radical \u201960s, and Wilson withdrew into seclusion.

Give Now By \u2014 Hillel Italie, Associated Press Hillel Italie, Associated Press\nBrian Wilson, the Beach Boys\u2019 visionary and fragile leader whose genius for melody, arrangements and wide-eyed self-expression inspired \u201cGood Vibrations,\u201d \u201cCalifornia Girls\u201d and other summertime anthems and made him one of the world\u2019s most influential recording artists, has died at 82. Wilson\u2019s family posted news of his death to his website and social media accounts Wednesday. Further details weren\u2019t immediately available. Since May 2024, Wilson had been under a court conservatorship to oversee his personal and medical affairs, with Wilson\u2019s longtime representatives, publicist Jean Sievers and manager LeeAnn Hard, in charge. The eldest and last surviving of three musical brothers \u2014 Brian played bass, Carl lead guitar and Dennis drums \u2014 he and his fellow Beach Boys rose in the 1960s from local California band to national hitmakers to international ambassadors of surf and sun. Wilson himself was celebrated for his gifts and pitied for his demons. He was one of rock\u2019s great Romantics, a tormented man who in his peak years embarked on an ever-steeper path to aural perfection, the one true sound. The Beach Boys rank among the most popular groups of the rock era, with more than 30 singles in the Top 40 and worldwide sales of more than 100 million. The 1966 album \u201cPet Sounds\u201d was voted No. 2 in a 2003 Rolling Stone list of the best 500 albums, losing out, as Wilson had done before, to the Beatles\u2019 \u201cSgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band.\u201d The Beach Boys, who also featured Wilson cousin Mike Love and childhood friend Al Jardine, were voted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988. Wilson feuded with Love over songwriting credits, but peers otherwise adored him beyond envy, from Elton John and Bruce Springsteen to Smokey Robinson and Carole King. The Who\u2019s drummer, Keith Moon, fantasized about joining the Beach Boys. Paul McCartney cited \u201cPet Sounds\u201d as a direct inspiration on the Beatles and the ballad \u201cGod Only Knows\u201d as among his favorite songs, often bringing him to tears. Wilson moved and fascinated fans and musicians long after he stopped having hits. In his later years, Wilson and a devoted entourage of younger musicians performed \u201cPet Sounds\u201d and his restored opus, \u201cSmile,\u201d before worshipful crowds in concert halls. Meanwhile, The Go-Go\u2019s, Lindsey Buckingham, Animal Collective and Janelle Mon\u00e1e were among a wide range of artists who emulated him, whether as a master of crafting pop music or as a pioneer of pulling it apart. An endless summer The Beach Boys\u2019 music was like an ongoing party, with Wilson as host and wallflower. He was a tall, shy man, partially deaf (allegedly because of beatings by his father, Murry Wilson), with a sweet, crooked grin, and he rarely touched a surfboard unless a photographer was around. But out of the lifestyle that he observed and such musical influences as Chuck Berry and the Four Freshmen, he conjured a golden soundscape \u2014 sweet melodies, shining harmonies, vignettes of beaches, cars and girls \u2014 that resonated across time and climates. Decades after its first release, a Beach Boys song can still conjure instant summer \u2014 the wake-up guitar riff that opens \u201cSurfin\u2019 USA\u201d; the melting vocals of \u201cDon\u2019t Worry Baby\u201d; the chants of \u201cfun, fun, fun\u201d or \u201cgood, good, GOOD, good vibrations\u201d; the behind-the-wheel chorus \u201c\u2019Round, \u2019round, get around, I get around.\u201d Beach Boys songs have endured from turntables and transistor radios to boom boxes and iPhones, or any device that could lay on a beach towel or be placed upright in the sand. The band\u2019s innocent appeal survived the group\u2019s increasingly troubled back story, whether Brian\u2019s many personal trials, the feuds and lawsuits among band members or the alcoholism of Dennis Wilson, who drowned in 1983. Brian Wilson\u2019s ambition raised the Beach Boys beyond the pleasures of their early hits and into a world transcendent, eccentric and destructive. They seemed to live out every fantasy, and many nightmares, of the California myth they helped create. From the suburbs to the national stage Brian Wilson was born June 20, 1942, two days after McCartney. His musical gifts were soon obvious, and as a boy he was playing piano and teaching his brothers to sing harmony. The Beach Boys started as a neighborhood act, rehearsing in Brian\u2019s bedroom and in the garage of their house in suburban Hawthorne, California. Surf music, mostly instrumental in its early years, was catching on locally: Dennis Wilson, the group\u2019s only real surfer, suggested they cash in. Brian and Love hastily wrote up their first single, \u201cSurfin,\u2019\u201d a minor hit released in 1961. They wanted to call themselves the Pendletones, in honor of a popular flannel shirt they wore in early publicity photos. But when they first saw the pressings for \u201cSurfin,\u2019\u201d they discovered the record label had tagged them \u201cThe Beach Boys.\u201d Other decisions were handled by their father, a musician of some frustration who hired himself as manager and holy terror. By mid-decade, Murry Wilson had been displaced and Brian, who had been running the band\u2019s recording sessions almost from the start, was in charge, making the Beach Boys the rare group of the time to work without an outside producer. Their breakthrough came in early 1963 with \u201cSurfin\u2019 USA,\u201d so closely modeled on Berry\u2019s \u201cSweet Little Sixteen\u201d that Berry successfully sued to get a songwriting credit. It was their first Top 10 hit and a boast to the nation: \u201cIf everybody had an ocean / across the USA / then everybody\u2019d be surfin,\u2019 / like Cali-for-nye-ay.\u201d From 1963-66, they were rarely off the charts, hitting No. 1 with \u201cI Get Around\u201d and \u201cHelp Me, Rhonda\u201d and narrowly missing with \u201cCalifornia Girls\u201d and \u201cFun, Fun, Fun.\u201d For television appearances, they wore candy-striped shirts and grinned as they mimed their latest hit, with a hot rod or surfboard nearby. READ MORE: This waltz is the unofficial soundtrack of floating through space. Soon it will beam through the cosmos Their music echoed private differences. Wilson often contrasted his own bright falsetto with Love\u2019s nasal, deadpan tenor. The extroverted Love was out front on the fast songs, but when it was time for a slow one, Brian took over. \u201cThe Warmth of the Sun\u201d was a song of despair and consolation that Wilson alleged \u2014 to some skepticism \u2014 he wrote the morning after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. \u201cDon\u2019t Worry Baby,\u201d a ballad equally intoxicating and heartbreaking, was a leading man\u2019s confession of doubt and dependence, an early sign of Brian\u2019s crippling anxieties. Stress and exhaustion led to a breakdown in 1964 and his retirement from touring, his place soon filled by Bruce Johnston, who remained with the group for decades. Wilson was an admirer of Phil Spector\u2019s \u201cWall of Sound\u201d productions and emulated him on Beach Boys tracks, adding sleigh bells to \u201cDance, Dance, Dance\u201d or arranging a mini-theme park of guitar, horns, percussion and organ as the overture to \u201cCalifornia Girls.\u201d By the mid-1960s, the Beach Boys were being held up as the country\u2019s answer to the Beatles, a friendly game embraced by each group, transporting pop music to the level of \u201cart\u201d and leaving Wilson a broken man. The Beach Boys vs. The Beatles The Beatles opened with \u201cRubber Soul,\u201d released in late 1965 and their first studio album made without the distractions of movies or touring. It was immediately praised as a major advance, the lyrics far more personal and the music far more subtle and sophisticated than such earlier hits as \u201cShe Loves You\u201d and \u201cA Hard Day\u2019s Night.\u201d Wilson would recall getting high and listening to the record for the first time, promising himself he would not only keep up with the British band, but top them. Wilson worked for months on what became \u201cPet Sounds,\u201d and months on the single \u201cGood Vibrations.\u201d He hired an outside lyricist, Tony Asher, and used various studios, with dozens of musicians and instruments ranging from violins to bongos to the harpsichord. The air seemed to cool on some tracks and the mood turn reflective, autumnal. From \u201cI Know There\u2019s an Answer\u201d to \u201cYou Still Believe in Me,\u201d many of the songs were ballads, reveries, brushstrokes of melody, culminating in the sonic wonders of \u201cGood Vibrations,\u201d a psychedelic montage that at times sounded as if recorded in outer space. The results were momentous, yet disappointing. \u201cGood Vibrations\u201d was the group\u2019s first million-seller and \u201cPet Sounds,\u201d which included the hits \u201cSloop John B\u201d and \u201cWouldn\u2019t It Be Nice,\u201d awed McCartney, John Lennon and Eric Clapton among others. Widely regarded as a new kind of rock LP, it was more suited to headphones than to the radio, a \u201cconcept\u201d album in which individual songs built to a unified experience, so elaborately crafted in the studio that \u201cPet Sounds\u201d couldn\u2019t be replicated live with the technology of the time. Wilson was likened not just to the Beatles, but to Mozart and George Gershwin, whose \u201cRhapsody in Blue\u201d had inspired him since childhood. But the album didn\u2019t chart as highly as previous Beach Boys releases and was treated indifferently by the U.S. record label, Capitol. The Beatles, meanwhile, were absorbing lessons from the Beach Boys and teaching some in return. \u201cRevolver\u201d and \u201cSgt. Pepper,\u201d the Beatles\u2019 next two albums, drew upon the Beach Boys\u2019 vocal tapestries and melodic bass lines and even upon the animal sounds from the title track of \u201cPet Sounds.\u201d The Beatles\u2019 epic \u201cA Day in the Life\u201d reconfirmed the British band as kings of the pop world and \u201cSgt. Pepper\u201d as the album to beat. All eyes turned to Wilson and his intended masterpiece \u2014 a \u201cteenage symphony to God\u201d he called \u201cSmile.\u201d It was a whimsical cycle of songs on nature and American folklore written with lyricist Van Dyke Parks. The production bordered on method acting; for a song about fire, Wilson wore a fire helmet in the studio. The other Beach Boys were confused, and strained to work with him. A shaken Wilson delayed \u201cSmile,\u201d then canceled it. Remnants, including the songs \u201cHeroes and Villains\u201d and \u201cWind Chimes\u201d were re-recorded and issued in September 1967 on \u201cSmiley Smile,\u201d dismissed by Carl Wilson as a \u201cbunt instead of a grand slam.\u201d The stripped down \u201cWild Honey,\u201d released three months later, became a critical favorite but didn\u2019t restore the band\u2019s reputation. The Beach Boys soon descended into an oldies act, out of touch with the radical \u201960s, and Wilson withdrew into seclusion.

Amanda Becker, reporter for The 19th, and Colleen Long, editor for NBC News, presented their post-Dobbs books at the 2025 Gaithersburg Book Festival in Gaithersburg, Maryland, May 17. Becker\u2019s \u201cYou Must Stand Up: The Fight for Abortion Rights in Post-Dobbs America\u201d and Long and Rebecca Little\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m Sorry for My Loss: An Urgent Examination of Reproductive Care in America,\u201d were both published in 2024. (Photo by Sofia Resnick/States Newsroom)\nDuring the pandemic, when many people were reevaluating their life goals, Colleen Long texted her childhood best friend and fellow journalist Rebecca Little to see if, together, they could write a relatable, even funny, book about pregnancy loss.\n\u201cMy friend Rebecca \u2026 she likes to say she kind of had the pu pu platter of loss,\u201d Long said during an author panel at the 2025 Gaithersburg Book Festival in Gaithersburg, Maryland, on May 17. \u201cShe had all sorts of terrible things happen: a stillbirth; she had to end the pregnancy of twins; she had several miscarriages. And I had a stillbirth.\u201d\nThey wanted to understand why it was so hard to talk about pregnancy loss in public, and thus difficult to process.\n\u201cShe and I started talking about how what we would really like to do is to write a book about why we are so bad at talking about pregnancy loss,\u201d said Long, a senior editor at NBC News. \u201cWhat is it about our culture that makes it impossible to sort of discuss this, and yet, when it happens to you, then all of these people come out of the woodwork and talk about it. We\u2019re saying it\u2019s like \u2018Fight Club,\u2019 but maybe we should be taking fewer cues, you know, from Brad Pitt.\u201d\nLong and Little ended up speaking to about 100 people who experienced some form of pregnancy loss and continue to hear from people with experiences since their book, \u201cI\u2019m Sorry for My Loss: An Urgent Examination of Reproductive Care in America,\u201d came out last year. Their book is also about how the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s reversal of federal abortion rights in June 2022, with the Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization decision, has exacerbated the consequences when pregnancy doesn\u2019t go the way it\u2019s supposed to. In the book, Little and Long document how pregnant and miscarrying women have been denied standard medical treatments because of state abortion bans, and how many people \u2014 disproportionately people of color \u2014 have been criminalized for decisions made while pregnant, long before Dobbs.\n\u201cIn some ways, reproduction in America has been stripped back to basics, but we don\u2019t find ourselves suddenly reliving a colonial life,\u201d they write. \u201cWe would argue it\u2019s more perverse in some ways because the advances in medicine are available, but they\u2019re being withheld. Like the Back to the Future timeline where Biff Tannen runs a dystopian Hill Valley, we\u2019re going back to a place we never really were.\u201d\nSubscribe to Reproductive Rights Today\nWant a better understanding of abortion policy in the states? Sign up for our free national newsletter. Reproductive Rights Today is a comprehensive daily wrap-up of changes to reproductive rights in the states, the front lines in the fight over abortion access in a Post-Roe America.\nJoining the panel was The 19th\u2019s Amanda Becker, whose \u201cYou Must Stand Up: The Fight for Abortion Rights in Post-Dobbs America,\u201d also published in 2024, tells the story of the first year after Roe v. Wade was overturned, from the perspective of abortion providers and reproductive rights activists.\n\u201cI truly think a lot of the people I feature in my book are heroes,\u201d Becker said. \u201cBeing around them was just so incredibly inspiring, and how hard they\u2019re working to help people and take care of people and preserve the ability to access care where people can still get it, and fighting to get it back where they can\u2019t.\u201d\nStates Newsroom reporter Sofia Resnick moderated the Q&A with the authors. The version below has been edited for brevity and clarity. The full conversation is scheduled to be broadcast on C-SPAN 2 Book TV on June 8.\nStates Newsroom: You both were working on these books before the Dobbs decision and you\u2019ve been both covering major national stories. Why did you both decide to dedicate so much time to this particular story?\nColleen Long: When Roe fell, it really sort of informed our reporting in a different way, because a lot of the procedures that are used to treat pregnancy loss are used to treat abortion. So, our book was focused more on pregnancy loss. But really, our sort of principle for the book is, what has happened in the past 50 years \u2014 since Roe has been codified and now fallen \u2014 is that we sort of hold out everything that isn\u2019t a perfect pregnancy or the end of an unwanted pregnancy. But there\u2019s this vast middle ground that a lot of people tend to experience. \u2026 When Roe fell, everybody was like, \u201cOh, this is not going to affect miscarriage care. This could possibly not affect a woman who is wanting a pregnancy and is unable to continue her pregnancy.\u201d And so what we\u2019ve seen, obviously, since the fall of Roe, is that actually these things are all very much intertwined. So our idea was to better inform everyone.\nAmanda Becker: My background is as a political reporter, not a health care reporter. So I was more interested in how reproductive rights, and abortion specifically, have really reordered our politics. It\u2019s the biggest political story of my lifetime, and because I\u2019m a person that was capable of giving birth, I also thought it was the most important story overall that affects more than half of this country directly. And I would argue that it affects everyone indirectly in some way.\nI just knew it was going to be a very big year, and that\u2019s why I decided to structure the book \u2014 it literally starts with the decision in June, and it ends the next June \u2014 because it was just such a sprawling story that I knew would affect every single state in a different way, and the residents in those states in different ways.\nSN: What were the parts of your books that were hardest to write?\nLong: Rebecca trained at [the famed Chicago improv theater] Second City, so she\u2019s funny, she will be the first to tell you. We wanted to make this book readable \u2026 so we worked on the tone a lot. That said, the hardest part about writing this book was interviewing the people. We interviewed 100 different people, and they ran the gamut. Some experienced a miscarriage, some had a stillbirth, some had multiple stillbirths. Some had to end their pregnancies because of a host of reasons. We interviewed people from every religion, conservative people, liberal people, all kinds of different people, and it was hard. As a journalist, you are used to listening to people and hearing stories that are upsetting, but I think the thing that was most upsetting for us was how common a lot of their stories were in that they all felt, like, alone, unsure, didn\u2019t know where to go.\nBecker: I was trying to write a book that was ultimately hopeful. \u2026 I would say the most difficult points were just, like, the overwhelmingness of what was happening that year. And because my book is kind of looking at the loss of abortion rights as happening in tandem with the erosion of our democracy, which is something I care a lot about, it just would start to feel overwhelming sometimes. Like, how are we going to fix these things that have been happening over the last 100 years, you know? How can we get reproductive rights back unless we fix gerrymandering?\nSN: In your respective historical research, what were some things that surprised you?\nBecker: I was floored when I found out that the American Medical Association came into being to elevate male doctors over female midwives and then go on an anti-abortion crusade over the next 30 years that eventually changed the laws in almost every state in this country.\n[Addressing Long:]And you get into this in your book, too: The father of gynecology did non-consensual experiments without anesthesia on enslaved women. And I\u2019m learning this history of women\u2019s healthcare and gynecological care and being like, this is how we ended up here.\nLong: We have a long history in the beginning of our book \u2014 it\u2019s literally called \u201cHow We Got Here\u201d \u2014 to sort of explain how our attitudes have changed over the years on pregnancy and pregnancy loss. Because, for example, the way we view pregnancy \u2014 this was really surprising to me \u2014 the way we view pregnancy today is really only like 47 to 48 years old, and it has to do so much with modern medical advances, sonograms, the home pregnancy test. Our ideas about how we bond and the way we discuss pregnancy is just so different.\nSN: What have been some of the impacts of increased anti-abortion laws on health care and grief and loss?\nLong: My OB-GYN came from Oklahoma [where abortion is banned] because she was, like, \u201cI feel as though I can\u2019t practice safely.\u201d \u2026 And the other thing we\u2019re noticing is that doctors \u2014 not OB-GYNs, but like any doctors \u2014 they\u2019re considering where to go to medical school. And the states in which the abortion laws are very strict, they\u2019re sort of looking away from those states because \u2026 they\u2019re afraid of their own medical care. So I would expect us in \u2014 I don\u2019t know, five years, maybe, let\u2019s say six years \u2014 we\u2019re going to start seeing like a real disparate situation in the United States, where we have some states with very good medical care, and other states, which, let\u2019s face it, already had poor medical care, are going to have worse medical care.\nBecker: You don\u2019t find out about a lot of really bad fetal abnormalities until the 20- to 21-week anatomy scan, so [people] made really difficult decisions, and a lot of them that I\u2019ve spoken to feel like they can\u2019t even grieve that openly because of what\u2019s in the public discourse right now about abortion and abortion bans. Yes, they had an abortion, but they\u2019re grieving a pregnancy that they very much wanted and a child that they very much wanted, and I think it\u2019s just making it more difficult for people to talk about.\nLong: This is where politics is tricky. \u2026 We interviewed a lot of women who identified as politically left-leaning who felt they weren\u2019t allowed to mourn their miscarriage because they didn\u2019t want to be seen as a traitor to the cause of abortion rights, which is hard.\nAnd then \u2026 you have what has happened with the restrictions and the fetal personhood laws. \u2026 This is a very new concept, to have the sort of baby and the mother have the same legal rights, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing play out in some of these places. And it plays out in really strange ways. Because when you have a life or death situation and you have these two entities, one does not exist without the other. And like, who is worth saving more? It\u2019s just a really complicated morass.\nBecker: If you talk to experts, both legal and medical, in fetal personhood and what it means in practice, they will tell you that in a fetal personhood situation where you\u2019re putting at odds the rights of a fetus versus the right of the gestational parent, the fetus always wins when we apply fetal personhood. And so we\u2019re going to see more and more of that.\nAudience Member: It seems to me that in the last political campaign, we started to hear a lot about the impact of these laws on women, and somehow that\u2019s fallen out of the news. And so how do we mobilize around this issue?\nBecker: I think we were hearing about it in part because it was an election season and a presidential election, and I would expect that to come back around for the midterms and the next time we have a lot of abortion ballot measures on ballots. \u2026 Politicians pay attention to what gets them elected or not elected. So if that\u2019s a reason you\u2019re going to elect someone or not elect them, let them know that.\nLong: I covered the [presidential] campaign, and like even during the campaign, I felt like these issues sort of only caught fire when they thought it could be a winning issue. And the Democrats are in a weird rebuilding phase right now, and so I think they\u2019re trying to figure out what works and what doesn\u2019t. \u2026 They were really hoping that reproductive rights and reproductive health was going to drive people to the polls, in particular women, and in the end, they lost. \u2026 And the conversation is no longer happening. But if you think about it, the conversation was never happening. It only just started happening, and then it was a blip. And then now we\u2019re sort of back to where we were, which is super annoying.\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

Inside the legal fight over the telehealth clinics that help women defy abortion bans\nEvery month, thousands of women evade abortion bans in their home states by turning to telehealth clinics willing to send them pregnancy-ending drugs through the mail\nEvery month, thousands of women thwart abortion bans in their home states by turning to telehealth clinics willing to prescribe pregnancy-ending drugs online and ship them anywhere in the country.\nWhether this is legal, though, is a matter of debate. Two legal cases involving a New York doctor could wind up testing the shield laws some states have passed to protect telehealth providers who ship abortion pills nationwide.\nDr. Margaret Carpenter faces a felony charge in Louisiana for supplying abortion medication through the mail to a pregnant teen in that state. The patient's mother also faces criminal charges. A Texas judge fined the same physician $100,000 after the state accused her of prescribing abortion medication for a woman near Dallas.\nSo far, the prosecution hasn't progressed thanks to New York's shield law, which has protected Carpenter from extradition to Louisiana. But other telehealth centers operating in states with similar legal protections for abortion providers are watching closely.\n\"We have great legal counsel who have advised us that what we are doing is legal,\u201d said Dr. Angel Foster, co-founder of The Massachusetts Medication Abortion Access Project, which is among a handful of telehealth providers that facilitate abortions from afar in states with bans.\nAs more states consider enacting shield laws or expanding existing ones, whether one state can shield providers from liability for breaking another state's laws around abortion is still an unsettled area of law.\nErik Baptist, senior counsel for the Alliance Defending Freedom, which opposes abortion, said shield laws violate a constitutional requirement that states respect the laws and legal judgments of other states.\n\"What these shield law states are doing are undermining the prerogative of these pro-life states to implement and enforce pro-life laws,\u201d said Baptist, director of the group\u2019s Center for Life. \u201dAnd so I think the Supreme Court ultimately will want to take this.\u201d\n\u201cThat is inherently a challenge with shield laws and telehealth,\u201d said Carmel Shachar, faculty director of the Health Law and Policy Clinic at Harvard Law School. \u201cAt a certain point, for the purposes of abortion bans, the courts will need to decide: Do we treat a telehealth abortion as happening within the state of the provider or within the state of the patient?\u201d\nDecades ago, the FDA approved the use of two prescription medicines \u2014 mifepristone and misoprostol \u2014 to terminate pregnancies.\nBut it wasn't until 2023 that telehealth abortions across states became more popular, after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.\nThe Society of Family Planning, which supports abortion rights, said that between April and June 2024 there were an average of 7,700 telehealth abortions performed each month in states that either ban abortion totally or after six weeks of pregnancy.\nThe prescribing process at telehealth clinics varies by provider, but usually takes place entirely online, with the patient answering a series of health-related questions and consent forms.\nAt some telehealth clinics, medical providers don't come face-to-face with patients, even via videoconferencing, and patients don't necessarily know the prescriber's name unless requested.\nFor instance, when Foster's clinic, also known as The MAP, puts pills in the mail, only the name of the practice appears on the label, as allowed under the Massachusetts shield law. If patients have follow-up questions, they can talk or text the doctor working that day, but may not know that doctor's name either.\nPills can arrive in a less than a week.\n\u201cThis has been the safety net, post-Dobbs, of allowing people who don\u2019t have the ability to travel out of state to get abortion care,\u201d said Greer Donley, a University of Pittsburgh law professor and abortion law expert.\nWhen dealing with medications not related to abortion, doctors are often able to write prescriptions for patients in other states. However, in most states, if the patient is located within its borders, the doctor must have a license issued by that state, according to Mei Wa Kwong, executive director of the The Center for Connected Health Policy.\nTwenty three states and Washington, D.C., currently have shield laws protecting abortion providers.\nOf those, eight have specific provisions protecting them from criminal prosecution or civil lawsuits even if the patient is in another state, according to the nonprofit research organization KFF. They include California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.\nLouisiana\u2019s request to extradite Carpenter hit a roadblock when New York Gov. Kathy Hochul rejected it, citing the state\u2019s shield law.

The decision comes as Trump's quick-changing tariff policies with top trade partners have spooked businesses and investors for the past several months. CME FedWatch, which anticipates interest-rate changes based on market moves, had projected a 99% chance of steady rates in June.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell has expressed concern that Trump's trade plans will negatively impact US companies and consumers, and said that the central bank is waiting to see the clear impact of these policies before making a rate-cut decision.\nDuring Wednesday's press conference, Powell said \"uncertainty is unusually elevated\" but he \"remains squarely focused\" on fostering maximum US employment and stable prices. He hopes that holding rates will make the Fed \"well positioned to respond in a timely way\" to economic developments \u2014 especially changes in trade, federal immigration policy, and global conflicts.\nIn its quarterly release of economic projections, the Fed still penciled in two cuts for this year, but when (and if) those cuts occur depends on economic conditions. The call to keep rates at steady this month comes alongside a modest rise in inflation. The year-over-year inflation rate ticked up in May to 2.4% from 2.3%, a figure lower than expected but still above the Fed's 2% goal. Wednesday's projections show the Fed's outlook has worsened since March, notably that expectations for inflation and unemployment have risen, and forecasts for GDP have declined.\n\"We expect a meaningful amount of inflation to arrive in the coming months,\" Powell said Wednesday, adding, \"Someone has to pay for the tariffs.\"\nStill, he said that the job market is healthy and stable. Unemployment is low and the US added jobs last month. While the labor market is slowing due to low quit and job vacancy rates, there's \"nothing that's troubling at this time\" and \"AI should be creating jobs at the same time it may be replacing\" others.\nSoft data indicators, like the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index, have fluctuated in recent months, further indicating that Americans are feeling the heat of high prices and tariff whiplash. And major events \u2014 like Israel's attack on Iran last week \u2014 could also impact inflation rates and the price of in-demand resources like oil going forward.\nThe president has repeatedly pushed for the Fed to lower rates sooner rather than later: \"'Too Late' Jerome Powell is a FOOL, who doesn't have a clue. Other than that, I like him very much!\" Trump wrote in a May 8 Truth Social post. \"Oil and Energy way down, almost all costs (groceries and 'eggs') down, virtually NO INFLATION, Tariff Money Pouring Into the U.S.\"\nFollowing a meeting with Trump at the end of May, Powell said in a statement that, \"he and his colleagues on the FOMC will set monetary policy, as required by law, to support maximum employment and stable prices and will make those decisions based solely on careful, objective, and non-political analysis.\"\nWhen asked about Trump's comments, Powell said that he's solely focused on the Fed's public service mission: \"That's what matters to us,\" he said Wednesday. \"That's all that matters.\"", "Fed rate decision: How it affects your bank accounts, loans, credit cards, and investments.

The cash is moving in and out of your account as you earn an income and pay bills. It's the convenience of liquidity that limits your earning power.\nThe national average of interest paid on checking accounts remains at 0.07%.

Who wants to talk about 'em? The only popular conversation begins with \"when will mortgage rates go back down to 3%?\"\nHome loan rates are still lingering in the upper-6% range.\nThe Fed's manipulation of overnight interest rates charged to banks doesn't directly steer mortgage rates. Those are more influenced by the bond market, particularly the 10-year Treasury note. The bond market reacts to forecasts for economic growth \u2014 or the lack of it.\nBad economic news, such as a resurgence of inflation or a recession, can move rates down. But who is hoping for that?\nHousing industry analysts with the Mortgage Bankers Association, Redfin, Realtor.com, and Zillow expect mortgage rates to remain in the 6% to 7% range through the end of this year.\nDig deeper: When will mortgage rates go down?\nPersonal loans\nPersonal loan interest rates have been hovering in the 12% range for well more than a year. They were around 9.5% for three years, from 2020 to 2022. Like mortgage rates, it will take time for them to get close to that again.\nWhat happens to credit cards when the Fed holds interest rates\nCredit card interest impacts everyone \u2014 except those who pay off their balance each month.\nOf course, that's a good thing to aim for, but in the meantime, c'mon, Fed, give us a break. Credit card rates have spiraled from around 15% in 2021 to over 21% in 2025.\nCredit card companies are clinging to the high interest that consumers are apparently still willing to pay. There's been no movement downward, even with last year's Fed rate cuts.\nYahoo Finance tip: The best way to earn a lower credit card interest rate right away is to ask. If you make regular payments and have seen your credit score improving, it's a good time to call your credit card provider and ask for a lower interest rate.\nHow the Fed's interest rate policy impacts your investments\nStock prices often react to the Fed\u2019s rate actions, but they are only one factor among many affecting the investing climate and stock prices.\nIf you intend to manage your investments to suit the current environment, keep watch on broader economic and corporate profit trends alongside interest rates. If you prefer to stay conservative, fill your portfolio with high-quality stocks that have proven themselves in all economic cycles.\nThen, wait patiently for long-term growth.", "WATCH LIVE: Powell holds news briefing amid new attacks by Trump.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak at 2:30 p.m. ET. Watch in the player above. The Fed kept its key rate unchanged for the fourth straight meeting Wednesday, and said the economy is expanding at \u201ca solid pace.\u201d Changes to the Fed\u2019s rate typically \u2014 though not always \u2014 influence borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, credit cards, and business loans. WATCH: Powell delivers remarks as Trump pushes budget that could add $5.1 trillion in debt The central bank also released its latest quarterly projections for the economy and interest rates. It expects noticeably weaker growth, higher inflation, and slightly higher unemployment by the end of this year than it had forecast in March, before President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs April 2. Most of those duties were then postponed April 9. The Fed also signaled it would cut rates just once in 2026, down from two cuts projected in March. Fed officials see inflation, according to its preferred measure, rising to 3% by the end of this year, from 2.1% in April. It also projects the unemployment rate will rise to 4.5%, from 4.2% currently. Growth is expected to slow to just 1.4% this year, down from 2.5% last year. Despite the gloomier outlook, Fed chair Jerome Powell and other officials have underscored that they are holding off from any changes to their key rate because of the uncertainty surrounding the impact of the tariffs and economic outlook. Some of the Fed\u2019s policymakers have expressed particular concern that the duties could boost prices, creating another surge of inflation just a couple of years after the worst inflation spike in four decades. Many economists say that without the higher import taxes, the Fed would likely be cutting its rate further. Yet so far, inflation has cooled this year to just 2.1% in April, essentially back at the central bank\u2019s target of 2%. Core inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy categories, remains elevated at 2.5%. Trump has pointed to the mild inflation figures to argue that the Fed should lower borrowing costs and has repeatedly criticized Powell for not doing so. On Wednesday he called Powell \u201cstupid\u201d and accused him of being \u201cpolitical\u201d for not cutting rates. Trump has previously argued that a rate cut would boost the economy. Now his focus has shifted to the federal government\u2019s borrowing costs, which have shot higher since the pandemic, with interest payments running at an annual rate of more than $1 trillion. Pushing the Fed to cut rates simply to save the government on its interest payments typically raises alarms among economists, because it would threaten the Fed\u2019s congressional mandate to focus on stable prices and maximum employment. One of Trump\u2019s complaints is that the Fed isn\u2019t cutting rates even as other central banks around the world have reduced their borrowing costs, including in Europe, Canada, and the U.K. On Tuesday, the Bank of Japan kept its key short-term rate unchanged at 0.5%, after actually raising it recently. But the European Central Bank, Bank of Canada, and Bank of England have reduced their rates this year in part because U.S. tariffs are weakening their economies. So far the U.S. economy is mostly solid, with the unemployment rate low. The Bank of England has cut its rate twice this year but is expected to keep it unchanged at 4.25% when it meets Thursday.

Give Now By \u2014 Christopher Rugaber, Associated Press Christopher Rugaber, Associated Press\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Federal Reserve officials expect inflation to worsen in the coming months but they still foresee two interest rate cuts by the end of this year, the same as they projected in March. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak at 2:30 p.m. ET. Watch in the player above. The Fed kept its key rate unchanged for the fourth straight meeting Wednesday, and said the economy is expanding at \u201ca solid pace.\u201d Changes to the Fed\u2019s rate typically \u2014 though not always \u2014 influence borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, credit cards, and business loans. WATCH: Powell delivers remarks as Trump pushes budget that could add $5.1 trillion in debt The central bank also released its latest quarterly projections for the economy and interest rates. It expects noticeably weaker growth, higher inflation, and slightly higher unemployment by the end of this year than it had forecast in March, before President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs April 2. Most of those duties were then postponed April 9. The Fed also signaled it would cut rates just once in 2026, down from two cuts projected in March. Fed officials see inflation, according to its preferred measure, rising to 3% by the end of this year, from 2.1% in April. It also projects the unemployment rate will rise to 4.5%, from 4.2% currently. Growth is expected to slow to just 1.4% this year, down from 2.5% last year. Despite the gloomier outlook, Fed chair Jerome Powell and other officials have underscored that they are holding off from any changes to their key rate because of the uncertainty surrounding the impact of the tariffs and economic outlook. Some of the Fed\u2019s policymakers have expressed particular concern that the duties could boost prices, creating another surge of inflation just a couple of years after the worst inflation spike in four decades. Many economists say that without the higher import taxes, the Fed would likely be cutting its rate further. Yet so far, inflation has cooled this year to just 2.1% in April, essentially back at the central bank\u2019s target of 2%. Core inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy categories, remains elevated at 2.5%. Trump has pointed to the mild inflation figures to argue that the Fed should lower borrowing costs and has repeatedly criticized Powell for not doing so. On Wednesday he called Powell \u201cstupid\u201d and accused him of being \u201cpolitical\u201d for not cutting rates. Trump has previously argued that a rate cut would boost the economy. Now his focus has shifted to the federal government\u2019s borrowing costs, which have shot higher since the pandemic, with interest payments running at an annual rate of more than $1 trillion. Pushing the Fed to cut rates simply to save the government on its interest payments typically raises alarms among economists, because it would threaten the Fed\u2019s congressional mandate to focus on stable prices and maximum employment. One of Trump\u2019s complaints is that the Fed isn\u2019t cutting rates even as other central banks around the world have reduced their borrowing costs, including in Europe, Canada, and the U.K. On Tuesday, the Bank of Japan kept its key short-term rate unchanged at 0.5%, after actually raising it recently. But the European Central Bank, Bank of Canada, and Bank of England have reduced their rates this year in part because U.S. tariffs are weakening their economies. So far the U.S. economy is mostly solid, with the unemployment rate low. The Bank of England has cut its rate twice this year but is expected to keep it unchanged at 4.25% when it meets Thursday.

The claim by the General Staff of the Ukrainian armed forces, which came on a holiday celebrating Russia\u2019s sovereignty, is in line with Western intelligence estimates. President Vladimir Putin marked Russia Day by hosting a Kremlin meeting with soldiers decorated for their service in Ukraine, but neither he nor any other officials commented on the Ukrainian claim. The U.K. Defense Ministry also said in a statement posted Thursday on X that Russia has suffered over 1 million casualties, including roughly 250,000 killed since it launched the full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022. On June 3, the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington said Russia likely would hit the mark of 1 million casualties this summer in what it called \u201ca stunning and grisly milestone.\u201d Russia last reported its military casualties early in the war when it acknowledged that about 6,000 soldiers had been killed. Earlier this year, the General Staff of the Russian armed forces claimed that Ukrainian military losses had topped 1 million. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last spoke of Ukrainian military losses in February, when he said in an interview that 45,100 troops had been killed and about 390,000 injured. The mutual claims of the other side\u2019s losses couldn\u2019t be independently verified. Russia launches more drone strikes The casualty estimates came as Russian forces pummeled Ukraine with drones and other weapons, killing three people and injuring scores of others despite international pressure to accept a ceasefire. According to the Ukrainian air force, Russia launched 63 drones and decoys at Ukraine overnight. It said that air defenses destroyed 28 drones while another 21 were jammed. Ukrainian police said two people were killed and six were injured in the past 24 hours in the eastern Donetsk region, the focus of the Russian offensive. One person was killed and 14 others were also injured in the southern Kherson region, which is partly occupied by Russian forces, police said. The authorities in Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, said 18 people, including four children, were injured by Russian drone attacks overnight.

Russia has launched waves of drones and missiles in recent days, with a record bombardment of almost 500 drones on Monday and a wave of 315 drones and seven missiles overnight on Tuesday. Ukraine responded to the Russian attacks with drone raids. Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said that air defenses downed 52 Ukrainian drones early Thursday, including 41 over the Belgorod region that borders Ukraine. Regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said a 2-year-old boy was killed Thursday in a Ukrainian drone attack, which also injured his grandmother. He previously reported three other injuries. Russia pushes its slow offensive in Ukraine\u2019s east The recent escalation in aerial attacks has come alongside a renewed Russian battlefield push along eastern and northeastern parts of the more than 1,000-kilometer (over 600-mile) front line. While Russian missile and drone barrage have struck regions all across Ukraine, regions along the front line have faced daily Russian attacks with short-range exploding drones and glide bombs. On Thursday, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed its troops captured two more villages in the Donetsk region, Oleksiivka and Petrivske. The Ukrainian military had no immediate comment on the Russian claim. The attacks have continued despite discussions of a potential ceasefire in the war. During their June 2 talks in Istanbul, Russian and Ukrainian negotiators traded memorandums containing sharply divergent conditions that both sides see as nonstarters, making a quick deal unlikely. Russia and Ukraine exchange more POWs The only tangible outcome of the talks was an agreement to exchange prisoners of war and the bodies of fallen soldiers. Russia and Ukraine conducted another POW swap on Thursday that included severely wounded and gravely ill captives, although the sides did not report the numbers. \u201cOur people are coming home,\u201d Zelenskyy said in a statement on Telegram. \u201cAll of them require medical treatment, and they will receive the necessary help.

Ukrainian and Western officials have been anticipating a Russian response to Kyiv\u2019s audacious June 1 drone attack on distant Russian air bases. Russia has been launching a record-breaking number of drones and missiles in recent days, despite both sides trading memoranda during direct peace talks in Istanbul on June 2 that set out conditions for a potential ceasefire. However, the inclusion of clauses that both sides see as nonstarters make any quick deal unlikely, and a ceasefire, long sought by Kyiv, remains elusive. The only tangible outcome of the talks has been in the exchange of prisoners of war, with a swap that began Monday for soldiers aged between 18 and 25.

Give Now By \u2014 Vasilisa Stepanenko, Associated Press Vasilisa Stepanenko, Associated Press By \u2014 Samya Kullab, Associated Press Samya Kullab, Associated Press\nKYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 Russia attacked two Ukrainian cities with waves of drones and missiles early Tuesday, killing three people and wounding at least 13 in what President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called \u201cone of the biggest\u201d strikes in the 3-year-old war. The attack struck Kyiv and the southern port city of Odesa. In an online statement, Zelenskyy said that Moscow\u2019s forces fired over 315 drones, most of them Shaheds, and seven missiles overnight. \u201cRussian missile and Shahed strikes are louder than the efforts of the United States and others around the world to force Russia into peace,\u201d Zelenskyy wrote, urging \u201cconcrete action\u201d from the U.S. and Europe in response to the attack.

Two people were killed and nine injured, according to the regional prosecutor\u2019s office. Another person was killed in Kyiv\u2019s Obolon district, regional head Tymur Tkachenko wrote on Telegram. \u201cRussian strikes are once again hitting not military targets but the lives of ordinary people. This once again shows the true nature of what we are dealing with,\u201d he said. Explosions and the buzzing of drones were heard around the city for hours. Attacks continue despite talks but POWs swapped The fresh attacks came a day after Moscow launched almost 500 drones at Ukraine in the biggest overnight drone bombardment in the war. Ukrainian and Western officials have been anticipating a Russian response to Kyiv\u2019s audacious June 1 drone attack on distant Russian air bases. Russia has been launching a record-breaking number of drones and missiles in recent days, despite both sides trading memoranda during direct peace talks in Istanbul on June 2 that set out conditions for a potential ceasefire. However, the inclusion of clauses that both sides see as nonstarters make any quick deal unlikely, and a ceasefire, long sought by Kyiv, remains elusive. The only tangible outcome of the talks has been in the exchange of prisoners of war, with a swap that began Monday for soldiers aged between 18 and 25.

Your personal data is probably being sold right now. Scam calls, junk emails, and weird login alerts aren't random. They're warning signs that your information is being circulated through data brokers, often without your knowledge or consent.\nMajor breaches, like the recent Adidas hack, have exposed millions of names, emails, phone numbers, and home addresses. Once this data is leaked, it's fed into a vast marketplace of data brokers who package, sell, and resell your information to advertisers, spammers, scammers and even cybercriminals.\nThink it hasn't happened to you? Here are 10 red flags that your data is already out there and the steps you can take to stop it from spreading further.\nSign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report\nGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide free when you join.\nBe proactive about your privacy\nIf your personal information appears on people-finder sites or in sketchy online databases, it stays there until you remove it. This means your full name, home address, email, and phone number are available to anyone, including scammers and stalkers. You can manually opt out of each site, but that takes time and patience. Instead, consider an automated privacy service that scans data broker sites and sends removal requests on your behalf. The less data floating around, the less likely it is to be misused.\n11 EASY WAYS TO PROTECT YOUR ONLINE PRIVACY IN 2025\nOVER 8M PATIENT RECORDS LEAKED IN HEALTHCARE DATA BREACH\n10 signs your data is being bought and sold\nIf any of these are happening to you, your data is likely already floating around the broker and scammer economy. Here's what to watch for:\n1. You're suddenly flooded with spam emails\nIf your inbox is overflowing with shady product offers, sketchy promotions, or strange marketing emails you never signed up for, it's a good bet your email address has been sold. This kind of spam typically results from your address being added to mass marketing lists purchased in bulk.\n2. You're getting nonstop scam calls\nMore calls than usual from unknown numbers? Telemarketers, fake IRS agents, and car warranty scammers often use brokered phone lists. If you're getting several calls a day, it likely means your number is being recycled by different call centers and fraud operations.\n3. You receive password-reset emails you didn't request\nUnfamiliar password-reset prompts are a sign someone is attempting to access your account. They may have found your email address and other leaked credentials and are now probing for weak points. It's a key signal that your digital footprint is being exploited.\n4. You notice strange charges on your bank account\nTiny charges can be a test by cybercriminals to see if stolen card info works. If even one unrecognized charge shows up, it's critical to act fast. These small transactions often lead to bigger, more damaging fraud if ignored.\n5. You're locked out of your own accounts\nLosing access to your email, bank, or social media accounts may mean hackers have already reset your passwords. With enough personal data, criminals can bypass security questions and fully take over your identity online.\nWHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?\n6. Friends say they got weird messages from you\nIf your contacts report strange DMs, fake money requests, or odd links coming from your accounts, that's a strong sign someone else has gained access. Cybercriminals use this tactic to trick your friends into clicking dangerous links or handing over money.\n7. Sketchy social media accounts start following you\nA wave of fake profiles suddenly following or messaging you is more than annoying; it could be a coordinated attempt to gather more information about you or impersonate you later. These accounts may also be bots programmed to phish for details or direct you to scam pages.\n8. Personal info is already filled in on new websites\nIf your name, email, or phone number shows up on a form before you even touch the keyboard, that website may have purchased your information. Some sites share consumer data with partners, and this pre-fill behavior can indicate that your data is being sold and shared.\n9. You find your profile on people-search websites\nSites like Spokeo or Whitepages can display your full name, home address, phone number, family members, and more often scraped from public records or sold by data brokers. This makes you a target for identity theft, scams, and unwanted contact.\n10. You're denied credit or insurance for unclear reasons\nRejections for loans, insurance, or rental applications can stem from inaccurate or outdated data in broker databases. If your reputation or credit score is being shaped by information you didn't even know existed, that's a clear signal that your data is out of your hands.\nCUSTOM DATA REMOVAL: WHY IT MATTERS FOR PERSONAL INFO ONLINE\nHow to stay safe: Steps to protect your data now\nNoticing just a few of these signs means it's time to take action. The more proactive you are, the better you can limit future damage and prevent your data from spreading further.\n1. Invest in a personal data removal service: Personal data removal services can request that your information be taken down from hundreds of data broker sites. It's an effective way to remove your name from public listings and stop new profiles from popping up. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.\nGet a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.\n2. Strengthen your passwords: Use long, unique passwords that are different for every account. Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.\n3. Turn on two-factor authentication: Adding a second step to your login process, like a text code or app confirmation, can stop hackers even if they know your password. Turn this on for email, banking, and any service that stores your sensitive info.\n4. Monitor your financial accounts regularly: Check your bank and credit card statements every few days. Set up alerts for any activity, and if you're not actively applying for credit, consider freezing your credit reports with all three bureaus.\n5. Use alias email addresses: Create separate email addresses for things like online shopping, sign-ups, and banking. This helps keep your primary inbox private and makes it easier to trace which services may be leaking or selling your information. If one alias starts receiving junk mail or suspicious messages, you can simply delete it without affecting your main account. It's one of the simplest ways to reduce spam and protect your digital identity. See my review of the best secure and private email services here.\n6. Don't click suspicious links or attachments, and use strong antivirus software: Phishing attempts often look convincing, especially if scammers already know your name or other details. If something feels off, delete the message and go directly to the website instead of clicking the link. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.\n7. Be cautious about what you post publicly: Avoid sharing your birthday, hometown, full name, or photos of your home or license plates. Social media platforms are heavily scraped by bots and bad actors looking to compile detailed profiles.\n8. Block robocalls and filter scam numbers: A surge in robocalls is a strong sign your phone number is being sold or shared by data brokers. These calls often come from spoofed or international numbers and may include fake IRS agents, tech support scams, or phony insurance offers. To fight back, enable your phone carrier's spam call protection (AT&T ActiveArmor, Verizon Call Filter, or T-Mobile Scam Shield). You can also use third-party apps like RoboKiller, Hiya, or Truecaller to screen calls, block known scam numbers, and report suspicious callers. Be sure to avoid answering unknown calls, even pressing a button to \"opt out\" can confirm your number is active and lead to more spam. Check out how to get rid of robocalls with apps and data removal services.\nWHAT HACKERS CAN LEARN ABOUT YOU FROM A DATA BROKER FILE\nKurt's key takeaways\nYour personal data is valuable, and once it's out there, it's difficult, sometimes impossible, to claw it back. But you're not powerless. The more proactive you are, the safer you'll be. Start by cleaning up your digital footprint and removing your information from people finder and data broker sites. Whether you go manual or use a trusted service, acting now can help you avoid bigger problems later.

Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide free when you join.\nFacebook scam warning: How Pamela almost fell for a tech support hoax\n\"I was working on my Facebook and it suddenly had a screen flash and voice that said the computer was locked and I needed to call a number to report the breach. I thought it was Microsoft so I called the number. The guy was good. He gave me a name and employee number and we went through some things on my computer which brought up a screen that said 'scammers were listening' and my IP was being used on the Porn Hub. I thought, how could that be? But still, I was obtuse.\n\"The screen listed what he said were all my credit cards that had been compromised, but only the beginning numbers: 3xxx, 4xxx, 5xxx, etc. He said in order to make a report to the FTC I needed to tell him all of the numbers. I told him I was not going to do that even though he insisted I had to for the 'report.' Then he said he would transfer me to the FTC and gave me a number in case we were disconnected. A different guy answered, gave me his name and said he was Andrew Ferguson, head of the FTC.\n\"I've been in politics and business for over 50 years. I looked him up while still on the phone and realized the head of the FTC wouldn't be answering a support line. When I refused to give him my information, he yelled that my IP was being used on porn sites and didn't want to stop it. I hung up.\n\"I have great virus software on all my devices and use two-step authentication for almost everything - but I still almost fell for it. I'm sharing this story to help others.\"\nPamela was fortunate. Her security measures and quick thinking saved her, but these tactics are becoming more common and more aggressive. Here's what you can do to stay safe.\nBeware of pop-up scams that impersonate Microsoft or the FTC\nScammers often use alarming pop-up messages or automated voices claiming your device is compromised, urging you to call a number for help. As described in Pamela's experience, a pop-up claimed her computer was locked and played a voice message directing her to call what appeared to be a Microsoft support number. The scammer then impersonated both a Microsoft employee and a government official, using fake names and employee numbers, and tried to pressure her into revealing sensitive information.\nIf you ever receive a pop-up or voice message claiming your device is at risk, do not call the number provided or share any personal information. Instead, contact the organization directly using official contact details from their website. Legitimate companies and government agencies will never ask you to provide sensitive information or credit card numbers over the phone in response to unsolicited pop-ups or calls.\nProtect your online accounts with strong, unique passwords\nMake sure each of your online accounts has a unique password. This prevents scammers from accessing multiple accounts if one gets compromised. While password generators provide secure passwords, you can also easily create one that's hard to crack by looking at three random things in the room and using them to form a password. Consider using a password manager for strong, unique passwords. A password manager helps you generate and securely store complex, unique passwords for each of your accounts. This prevents you from reusing passwords and makes it much harder for scammers to access multiple accounts if one is compromised.

Take your time to verify any urgent requests, especially those involving money or personal information. Don't act on impulse.\nCheck URLs carefully before you click them, and use strong antivirus software\nVerify links before clicking them, especially if they come from someone who randomly contacted you on the internet. Scammers often use URLs that look similar to legitimate sites, but they typically contain slight misspellings or different domains (e.g., payepal.com or Microsoft.xyz). Also, install and update strong antivirus software.\nProtect all your devices, including computers, tablets, and smartphones, with strong antivirus software. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.\nDON\u2019T CLICK THAT LINK! HOW TO SPOT AND PREVENT PHISHING ATTACKS IN YOUR INBOX\nAlways update the software you use\nBe sure each operating system, browser, and security software you use is updated on your computers and mobile devices. These updates often include patches that fix security vulnerabilities that scammers might exploit.\nBe cautious with personal information on social media\nThink twice before sharing personal details, such as your birthday, address, or even your pet's name. Scammers can use information from your social media profiles to guess passwords or craft personalized phishing attacks.\nHOW HACKERS ARE BREAKING INTO APPLE DEVICES THROUGH AIRPLAY\nEnable multifactor authentication (MFA) on all accounts\nDon't limit MFA to just your main accounts. Enable it wherever possible, including email, social media, and financial services. Multifactor authentication adds an extra step to the login process, making it significantly harder for scammers to gain access, even if they have your password.\nUse a personal data removal service to clean up your online footprint\nScammers often scour the internet for your personal information. Using a personal data removal service can help reduce the amount of your sensitive data available online, making it harder for scammers to target you with convincing attacks. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy.\nThese services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.

Early detection is key. If you spot something suspicious, report it immediately to your financial institution and the proper authorities.\nBack up your important data regularly\nRansomware and other attacks can lock you out of your files. Regularly back up your important data to an external hard drive or a secure cloud service. This ensures you can recover your information if your device is compromised.\nReport online scams to these official authorities\nIf you encounter a scam, reporting it to the proper authorities can help you recover lost funds and prevent others from falling victim to the same scam. By reporting scams, you contribute to a database that allows law enforcement to track patterns and catch criminals. Places you can report to include the FTC, your local FBI office, the IC3 and your state's consumer protection office.\nKurt's key takeaways\nKeep in mind that scammers are constantly evolving their tactics. You must always be on guard. Do not rely too heavily on technology to protect you, since there is a psychological aspect to their methods as well. Have a skeptical mindset and trust your instincts.

Don\u2019t overshare: Even with AI tools like ChatGPT\nAI chatbots like ChatGPT are useful, but they're not private journals. The platform owners may have privacy policies and use the latest security measures, but that doesn't mean you should let your guard down. When using these tools, refrain from sharing any personal information, such as your name, address, birthdate, passwords, financial details or sensitive conversations. Remember that AI systems store and process your inputs, and despite security promises, data breaches can occur.\nSCAMMERS CAN EXPLOIT YOUR DATA FROM JUST 1 CHATGPT SEARCH\nTip: Treat all online forms of AI interaction like public forums. Keep your examples generic and use caution with anything that could identify you.\nIf you're going to input your personal information while using these AI tools, ensure there is an option to prevent them from sharing it. On ChatGPT, for instance, do the following:\n- Go to Settings.\n- Click Data controls.\n- Tap Improve the model for everyone.\n- Toggle off Improve the model for everyone.\n- Click Done.\nWhy it matters: AI tools may seem personal, but they\u2019re not secure vaults. Guarding what you share helps prevent misuse, identity theft or data leaks from breaches.\nCLEAN UP YOUR PHONE: SPEED, STORAGE AND PRIVACY BOOST IN MINUTES\n2. Use alias email addresses\nYour email is often the key to your online identity and a common target for spam. By creating disposable email aliases that forward messages to your main inbox, you can keep your real address hidden from websites and services. These unique aliases act as shields, so if one starts getting spammed or is involved in a data breach, you can simply deactivate it without affecting your main email account.\nMy top recommendation to avoid being inundated with spam emails is to use an alias email address. An alias email address is an additional email address that can be used to receive emails in the same mailbox as the primary email address. It acts as a forwarding address, directing emails to the primary email address.\nIn addition to creating throwaway email accounts for online sign-ups and other circumstances where you would not want to disclose your primary email address, alias email addresses are helpful for handling and organizing incoming communications.\nSometimes, it's best to create various email aliases so that you don't have to worry about getting tons of spam mail or having your information taken in a data breach. An alias email address is a great way for you to stop receiving constant spam mail by simply deleting the email alias address. See my review of the best secure and private email services here.\nWhy it matters: You stay anonymous, avoid data leaks and never have to change your main email address again.\nBEST ANTIVIRUS FOR MAC, PC, IPHONES AND ANDROIDS \u2013 CYBERGUY PICKS\n3. Take advantage of Facebook\u2019s privacy checkup\nMeta frequently updates its privacy settings, so it's best to check regularly to see how you can improve your privacy. Use Facebook's Privacy Checkup tool to review and adjust crucial settings, including post visibility, app permissions, search visibility and friend-request settings. This comprehensive tool helps ensure your profile remains as private as you want it to be. You can find the tool by following these steps:\n- Log in to your Facebook app on your phone.\n- Then click the menu icon in the bottom right.\n- Tap Settings.\n- Click Privacy Checkup.\nOnce you open the Privacy Checkup, you'll be guided through several key areas to customize your privacy preferences and better control your information.\n- Who can see what you share: Adjust who can view your posts, photos and profile details to limit access to only people you trust.\n- How people can find you on Facebook: Manage who can send you friend requests, look you up using your email or phone number, and decide whether your profile appears in search engines.\n- Your data settings on Facebook: Review which apps and websites have access to your Facebook data and remove any you no longer use or trust.\n- How to keep your account secure: Set up two-factor authentication, update your password and monitor login alerts to protect your account from unauthorized access.\n- Your ad preferences on Facebook: Control how Facebook uses your activity to show you personalized ads and opt out of categories that feel too intrusive.\nQuick tip: Set a reminder to run a privacy checkup every few months, especially after major Facebook updates. This way, you\u2019ll always be in control of your information.\nWhy it matters: Social media platforms thrive on your personal data. Adjusting your settings regularly puts you back in control of what others and Facebook can see and use.\nHOW TO PROTECT YOUR ONLINE PRIVACY AND SECURITY ON YOUR NEXT CRUISE VACATION\n4. Scrub yourself off the internet automatically\nYour name, phone number and home address may already be listed on people-search sites like Spokeo, Whitepages and BeenVerified. These data brokers collect and sell your personal information without you even knowing it. Fortunately, personal data removal services are available to protect your privacy. They automatically send legal removal requests to hundreds of data brokers. They also go above and beyond by continuously monitoring them in case these third parties happen to get your information again.\nWhile no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.\nGet a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.\nWhy it matters: The less personal information available about you online, the harder it is for scammers and identity thieves to target you and the more peace of mind you'll have.\n10 SIMPLE STEPS TO IMPROVE YOUR SMARTPHONE\u2019S SECURITY AND PRIVACY\n5. Use a privacy-focused messaging app\nIf you're still using standard texting apps or platforms like Facebook Messenger, it's time to upgrade to a more secure option. Apps like Signal and Session offer end-to-end encryption, no ads and no metadata tracking, meaning they can't see who you're talking to or what you're saying. Both apps support disappearing messages, giving you more control over how long your conversations stick around.\nWhy it matters: Your messages stay private and can't be accessed by hackers, advertisers or the app developers themselves.\n6. Stop Google from tracking your every move\nGoogle collects a massive amount of data from your searches, YouTube views, Gmail activity and location history, all of which fuels targeted advertising. You can stop much of this tracking by turning off Ad Personalization and deleting your activity history. Here's what to do:\n- Go to Google's My Ad Center.\n- Find the Ad Personalization section.\n- Toggle the switch to turn off ad personalization. This stops Google from using your activity to tailor ads.\nManage activity history\n- In My Ad Center or via your Google Account, go to Data & Privacy.\n- Under History Settings, review and pause or delete: Web & App Activity, YouTube History and Location History (if applicable).\nDelete existing activity data\n- Select Manage all Web & App Activity, Manage all YouTube History, etc.\n- Delete past activity by choosing a time range (e.g., \"All time\") and confirming deletion for each category.\nOpt out of third-party ad personalization\n- Scroll to Ad settings and look for third-party ad personalization options.\n- Opt out of partner sites' ad personalization if available.\n- If you have multiple Google accounts, repeat these steps for each account.\nWhy it matters: Cutting down on ad tracking reduces how much of your online behavior is used to build a profile on you, often without your knowledge.\n7. Turn off location tracking on your smartphone\nApps don't need to know your every move. Disabling or limiting location tracking is one of the simplest ways to protect your physical privacy. Here's what to do:\niPhone:\n- Go to Settings.\n- Tap Privacy & Security.\n- Click Location Services.\n- Scroll down and tap the app you want to manage.\n- Choose your preferred setting: Never to block location access completely; Ask Next Time Or When I Share to allow location only with your permission; While Using the App to allow location only when the app is open.\nFor apps like Maps, toggle Precise Location off to prevent pinpoint tracking.\nTo disable location tracking entirely, toggle Location Services off at the top of the Location Services page (this will stop all apps from using your location).\nAndroid:\nSettings may vary depending on your Android phone\u2019s manufacturer.\n- Go to Settings.\n- Tap Location.\n- Tap App permissions or App location permissions.\n- You will see a list of apps grouped by their location access: Allowed all the time; Allowed only while in use; Ask every time; Not allowed.\n- Tap any app to change its location permission. Choose from: Allow all the time; Allow only while using the app; Ask every time; Don't allow.\nFor apps that have location access, you can also turn Precise location on or off if you want to limit accuracy. Repeat for each app you want to manage.\nTip: If you want to stop all apps from accessing your location, you can turn off Location at the top of the Location settings page.\nWhy it matters: Prevents apps, advertisers and even your OS from building a detailed map of your daily routines.\nWHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?\n8. Change the default admin password on your router\nMost routers ship with default admin usernames and passwords like \"admin\" or \"1234,\" and these are publicly available online. Hackers know this and often scan networks looking for unprotected routers. Here's what to do:\n- Log in to your router's settings via its IP address (often 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1).\n- Change the admin username and password to something strong and unique.\n- Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.\nWhy it matters: Prevents intruders from hijacking your home network and spying on your devices.\n9. Enable WPA3 encryption on your Wi-Fi router\nWPA3 is the newest wireless encryption protocol and offers much stronger protection than WPA2. If your router supports WPA3, enabling it is a no-brainer. How to check:\n- Log into your router settings and look under Wireless Security.\n- If WPA3 is available, enable it.\n- If not, consider upgrading to a newer, security-focused router. Check out our top routers for best security 2025.\nWhy it matters: Stronger encryption means hackers can't easily intercept or crack your Wi-Fi traffic.\n10. Set up a guest network for visitors and smart devices\nYour friends don't need access to your entire home network and neither do your smart lights and doorbells. Creating a guest network adds a safety barrier between your personal devices and less trustworthy ones. Steps to take:\n- Log into your router settings.\n- Create a separate guest network with its own password.\n- Connect smart devices, TVs and guests to this network only.\n- Keep your main network just for personal computers and phones.\nWhy it matters: Even if a smart device gets compromised, the attacker won't have access to your main network or sensitive devices.\n11. Use a secure, private browser for sensitive browsing\nNot all browsers treat your privacy equally. Switching to a browser designed for privacy like Brave, Firefox or DuckDuckGo's browser can drastically cut down on the amount of data collected about you while you browse. Also, use incognito/private mode for sensitive searches.\nWhy it matters: Reduces digital fingerprints and helps stop advertisers and data brokers from building a profile on you based on your browsing behavior.\nSUBSCRIBE TO KURT\u2019S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICES\nKurt\u2019s key takeaways\nStaying private online isn't about being paranoid; it's about making smart, intentional choices.

Defense says the move hurts jury\u2019s diversity Nation Jun 16, 2025 4:06 PM EDT NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 A judge dismissed a juror in the sex trafficking trial of Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs on Monday after concluding that his conflicting answers about where he lives might indicate he had an agenda or wanted to stay on the jury for a purpose. Judge Arun Subramanian made the ruling after rejecting arguments by Combs\u2019 attorneys that it would disrupt the diversity of the jury to replace the Black man with a white juror. READ MORE: A timeline of Diddy\u2019s career and legal troubles Combs, 55, has pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy charges after his September arrest at a New York hotel. He was denied bail multiple times and has remained incarcerated at a federal lockup in Brooklyn ever since. Subramanian had first announced late Friday that he was dismissing the juror after questions arose over whether he resided in New York or New Jersey most of the time, but multiple defense lawyers protested and the judge waited until Monday to announce his final decision. The judge said a review of the juror\u2019s answers to questions about his residency during jury selection, along with his subsequent responses to similar questions in the robing room, revealed \u201cclear inconsistencies.\u201d \u201cTaking these all together, the record raised serious concerns as to the juror\u2019s candor and whether he shaded answers to get on and stay on the jury,\u201d he said. Subramanian said to leave the juror on the panel could threaten the integrity of the judicial process, and he rejected a defense request that he question him further, saying it could lead to \u201canother set of shifting answers. \u2026 In other words, there\u2019s nothing that the juror can say at this point that would put the genie back in the bottle and restore his credibility.\u201d The judge expressed disappointment that the defense asked him again in a weekend letter to consider the racial makeup of the jury in his ruling as it accused prosecutors of misconduct. \u201cThe court should not, indeed cannot, let race factor into the decision of what happens. Here, the answer is clear. Juror No. 6 is excused,\u201d Subramanian said before the jury, minus Juror No. 6, was brought into the courtroom for the resumption of testimony. Defense lawyers in the letter also accused prosecutors of misconduct in a \u201ccoordinated effort to try to destroy one of the most successful Black men in American history.\u201d \u201cThe government\u2019s case is all about his personal life, and what he and his romantic partners have done in the privacy of the bedroom,\u201d the lawyers wrote. \u201cThere has been no evidence of prosecutorial misconduct brought to the court\u2019s attention. Zero,\u201d the judge said, rejecting the defense\u2019s third request for a mistrial. Prosecutors have said they expect to rest sometime this week. The trial is in its sixth week. On Monday, prosecutors called what\u2019s known as a summary witness to read aloud numerous text messages that jurors hadn\u2019t previously heard. They included exchanges in which the woman who testified under the pseudonym \u201cJane\u201d complained to Combs about their \u201chotel night\u201d and \u201cwild king night\u201d sex marathon lifestyle and to his chief of staff, Kristina Khorram, about his threats to release explicit videos of her having sex with other men. Jane, who dated Combs from 2021 until his arrest last year, excoriated the hip-hop star in a series of text messages after his former longtime girlfriend Cassie, the R&B singer whose legal name is Casandra Ventura, filed a lawsuit against him alleging years of sexual abuse, control and violence. On Nov. 28, 2023, about two weeks after Combs settled the lawsuit, Jane told him that she felt he exploited her with their \u201cdark and humiliating lifestyle.\u201d She wrote that for the three years they were together, she felt confused by their relationship and that being with Combs had deprived her of work opportunities. A month later, Jane texted Khorram that Combs \u201cjust threatened me about my sex tapes that he has on two phones. He said he would send them to my baby daddy.\u201d Jane noted that she didn\u2019t typically involve Khorram in such matters, but said she needed help because Combs was having one of his \u201cevil-ass psychotic bipolar\u201d episodes and, along with threatening her, was saying he\u2019d call the police on her. Jane told Khorram that she was heavily drugged in the tapes. Support PBS News Hour Your donation makes a difference in these uncertain times. Give Now By \u2014 Michael R.

Give Now", "17 biggest Diddy trial bombshells &mdash; as the prosecution readies to rest its case. - It's the sixth week of testimony in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' sex-trafficking and racketeering trial.\n- Combs' two sex-trafficking accusers have testified, and the prosecution will soon rest.\n- Here are 17 of the biggest revelations from the trial so far.\nIt's week six of the Sean \"Diddy\" Combs sex-trafficking and racketeering trial.\nA federal jury in Manhattan has heard R&B singer Cassie Ventura \u2014 Combs' ex-girlfriend and the catalyst for his public downfall \u2014 tearfully testify about the humiliating \"freak offs\" she says she endured throughout their 11-year relationship.\nA second sex-assault accuser, who testified as \"Mia,\" described four times she says Combs attacked her, and a third accuser. The third accuser, \"Jane,\" testified about the alleged violence underlying what prosecutors say were her three years as Combs' sex-trafficking victim.\nAlong the way, there have been numerous celebrity mentions, including pop icon Britney Spears, actor Michael B. Jordan, rapper Kid Cudi, and late music legend Prince.\nCombs was arrested in September on charges of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution \u2014 the culmination of months of lawsuits and public accusations of sexual assault and other misconduct.\nThe music tycoon is arguing through his defense team that all sexual encounters were consensual, including the alleged drug-fueled freak offs at the trial's center \u2014 and that any violence fell short of sex trafficking.\nHere are some of the most striking moments from the trial so far.\nKanye West granted VIP courtroom access\nYe, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, has been given special access to attend his pal Combs' trial.\nThe \"Jesus Walks\" rapper has been added to Combs' friends and family trial guest list, according to two sources with knowledge of the document.\nYe showed up to court to support Combs during the trial's fifth week, but was denied entry to the Manhattan courtroom.\n\"He did not wait in line like everybody else from the public,\" a court source previously told BI. \"No one gets special treatment.\"\nYe was instead seated in an overflow room on the courthouse's 23rd floor \u2014 three floors below where Combs' trial is unfolding \u2014 and left after listening to about half an hour of testimony.\nIt's not clear whether Ye will be back to support Combs at his trial, but if he does, he will have a seat available alongside Combs' family members in the courtroom.\nDiddy's ex says he beat her a month after he apologized for Cassie abuse\nIn May 2024, shortly after CNN aired hotel surveillance video showing Combs dragging Ventura down a hallway and beating her, the rapper posted an apology on Instagram.\nOn video, Combs told his followers that his behavior that day was \"inexcusable\" \u2014 and that he began therapy soon after the 2016 hotel incident.\n\"I take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I'm disgusted. I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now,\" he said in his Instagram video.\nOn June 9, however, Combs' ex testified that exactly one month after he posted that apology, he abused her, leaving her face covered in bruises.\nAfter the abuse, she said, Combs leaned close to her and asked her: \"Is this coercion?\"\nThe woman, who testified under the pseudonym \"Jane,\" said he then demanded she put on makeup, pop an ecstasy pill, and have sex with a male escort.\n\"Take this fucking pill. You're not going to ruin my fucking night,\" Jane said Combs demanded as she screamed, \"I don't want to! I don't want to!\"\nProsecutors say Combs sex trafficked Ventura and Jane by means of false promises, violence, and coercion.\nJane's and other trial witnesses' testimony contradicts the story she says Combs told people close to him after the CNN video was released.\nJane testified that when the news broke, Combs \"huddled\" with his team and his family.\n\"He said that that was the only time that they had physical violence like that,\" Jane said of the abuse between Combs and Ventura. \"He said that she was a hitter and she would hit.\nAt trial, the jury has heard testimony from multiple witnesses describing more than a dozen times they said Combs physically abused Ventura between 2008 and 2018.\nA witness said Combs personally counted a $100K bribe to kill the Cassie hotel video\nA former security guard described Combs personally pulling $100,000 out of a paper bag and counting it, painting an image that's both surprising and legally significant.\nThe guard said Combs hoped the cash \u2014 prosecutors call it a bribe \u2014 would bury forever a 15-minute video showing him beating Ventura in the hallway of the InterContinental Hotel in Los Angeles in March, 2016.\nCombs fed \"stacks of $10,000 at a time\" into a money-counting machine, then stuffed it back in the paper bag, according to the ex-guard, Eddy Garcia.\nThe ex-guard said Combs then handed him the bag as payment for a USB thumb drive containing what both men believed was the only copy of the incriminating footage.\n\"Eddy, my angel,\" the guard said Combs called him after the transaction.\n\"Something like this would ruin him,\" he said Combs told him.\nEight years later, a surviving copy of the video was first made public by CNN. Now, it's the single most important piece of evidence in the trial, both sides say.\nProsecutors say the video shows Combs in the very act of sex-trafficking Ventura, meaning coercing her through physical force into engaging in sex at the hotel with a male sex worker known only as \"Jewels.\"\nThe first charge in Combs' indictment accused him of racketeering, a charge that requires proof of at least two underlying crimes. Prosecutors may argue that the video alone is proof of three underlying crimes: sex trafficking, bribery, and obstruction of justice.\nProsecutors hope the video will also clinch the second charge in Combs' indictment, which accuses him of sex trafficking Ventura. Both racketeering and sex trafficking carry maximum sentences of life in prison.\nCombs raped his PA, \"Mia,\" as she slept in the staff room at his Beverly Hills mansion, she said\nOne of Combs' former personal assistants testified under the pseudonym \"Mia,\" telling jurors he sexually attacked her four times between 2009 and 2017, when she was in her mid-20s and early 30s.\nShe said that two of the attacks were at the sprawling glass and concrete mansion he rented in Beverly Hills, including a rape in the staff bedroom. She described waking to feeling Combs on top of her. \"Be quiet,\" she said he told her.\n\"I knew his power and I knew his control over me,\" she told the jury, her voice hushed and halting.\n\"And I didn't want to lose everything that I worked so hard for \u2014 or this, like, this world that was the only thing I had anymore.\"\nCombs beat Ventura outside a Prince party, Mia also told jurors\nCombs once attacked Ventura during a party thrown by music icon Prince, the former personal assistant also testified.\nThe ex-PA, who used the pseudonym \"Mia,\" told the jury she and Ventura had snuck out to Prince's Los Angeles home after learning he would be performing for a small gathering \u2014 a \"once-in-a-lifetime\" experience, as Ventura described it on the stand.\nPrince did not disappoint. Mia said that as he played music, they danced atop his backyard pool, which was backlit and covered in purple plexiglas.\nThen Combs showed up, she said.\n\"I saw his bucket hat come through the entrance and then made eye contact with him,\" Mia said of Combs. \"Me and Cass just booked it.\"\nThey ran through Prince's house and into the woods out front, where \"Puff caught Cass,\" and started beating her, Mia said, until Prince's security intervened.\nLater that night, Ventura testified that Combs continued to beat her back at her hotel, leaving her with \"bruising on my face, knots on my head.\"\nEx-employee Capricorn Clark testified Combs kidnapped her at gunpoint\nCapricorn Clark, another former personal assistant and one who became one of his top marketing executives, kicked off week three of the trial by telling jurors that he once kidnapped her at gunpoint.\nIt was December 2011, after Combs learned of rapper Kid Cudi's brief relationship with Ventura, Clark testified on May 27.\nCombs was \"furious\" with Clark for keeping him in the dark about Ventura's romance with the \"Pursuit of Happiness\" rapper, she said.\nClark told the jury that Combs, armed with a gun, went to her house in a rage and banged on the door.\n\"He just said, 'Get dressed, we're going to go kill'\" him, Clark testified that Combs told her, using the N-word to refer to Kid Cudi.\nCombs then took Clark to Kid Cudi's Los Angeles home, she told the jury, describing it as being \"kidnapped.\"\n\"The way he was acting, I just felt like anything could happen,\" a tearful Clark testified.\nEx-exec says years before \"freak offs\" Combs took Kim Porter to hotels too \u2014 with candles and baby oil\nIn the first week of trial testimony, Ventura told jurors that starting in late 2008, she was coerced by Combs into a decade's worth of near-weekly \"freak offs\" \u2014 dayslong sex performances, usually at luxury hotels, involving male escorts, Glade candles, and numerous bottles of baby oil.\nClark told jurors that in the years she was Combs personal assistant, from 2004 until 2006, she would set up and clean up the hotel rooms where Combs took another longterm girlfriend, model Kim Porter, the mother of four of Combs' children.\nDuring those years, Combs and Porter would stay for days at luxury hotels in Atlanta, Los Angeles, and New York. Clark said, as a personal assistant, she made sure Combs' suite was stocked with ecstasy, baby oil, and pricey Diptyque candles.\nCleanup was tricky, Clark told jurors, who mentioned \"handprints left in oil on the, like, ultra-suede wall\" as a particular problem. \"It was just a lot of baby oil. It was just everywhere.\"\nThese were not \"freak offs,\" Porter's former family attorney, Suzanne Kimberly Bracker, told Business Insider.\n\"He was madly in love with Kim,\" said Bracker, who helped negotiate Combs' child support settlement and who said that Porter had two children with Combs at the time.\n\"There is absolutely no way that he would share her with another man,\" she said. \"He would tell her 'I'm not gonna pay for an apartment with my kids in one room while you're with another guy in the other bedroom.'\"\nKid Cudi said Combs broke into his house and probably torched his Porsche\nKid Cudi took the witness stand in Combs' trial on May 22, telling jurors that in December 2011, the music tycoon broke into his Hollywood Hills home, enraged after finding out about the rival rapper's short-lived romance with Ventura.\nKid Cudi, given name Scott Mescudi, told the jury that he returned home after the break-in to find the Christmas gifts he'd planned to give his family unwrapped and opened. His dog, he said, had been shut in the bathroom.\n\"Motherfucker, you in my house?\" Mescudi recalled telling Combs over the phone as he raced home to confront him.\nCombs was gone by the time he arrived, Mescudi said.\nMescudi also told the jury that some two weeks later, his Porsche was firebombed while in his driveway.\nThe Porsche \"arson\" is a specific element in the racketeering charges against Combs. Prosecutors alleged in court papers that Combs ordered his underlings to torch a vehicle \"by slicing open the car's convertible top and dropping a Molotov cocktail inside the interior.\"\nCassie's mom describes 'trying to hit' Combs in a fight over her daughter's stolen phone\nRegina Ventura corroborated her daughter's testimony, telling jurors she witnessed the aftermath of two of Combs' violent, jealous rages over romantic rivals.\nThe first was in 2011. The mom said Cassie Ventura came home to Connecticut for the Christmas holidays with a large bruise on her back.\nCassie Ventura had told jurors the week before that the bruise was from being kicked to the ground by Combs during a fight over Mescudi.\nRegina Ventura also confirmed a 2016 incident from shortly before the younger Ventura's 30th birthday. Combs had swiped her cellphone, Cassie Ventura testified, after learning about her affair with an unnamed professional NFL player.\nWhen she returned to her Los Angeles apartment without her phone, her mother, who was visiting, called the police and confronted Combs outside the building as her daughter remained upstairs, the elder Ventura testified.\n\"I was yelling and screaming and trying to hit him,\" the mom told jurors. \"He did give it back,\" she told jurors of the missing phone.\nCassie screamed, 'Isn't anybody seeing this?' as Combs attacked her on his private jet, ex-assistant says\nA former Combs personal assistant described watching \u2014 and doing nothing \u2014 as his boss brutally attacked a cowering Ventura in the bedroom of the rapper's private jet.\nGeorge Kaplan, 34, said the attack happened on a crowded flight to Las Vegas in the latter half of 2015. Kaplan said he heard the sound of screams and shattering glass coming from the jet's bedroom.\nHe said he turned to see Combs standing over Ventura with a \"whiskey rock glass\" in his hand, as she cowered on the bed.\n\"After the glass crashed, Ventura screamed, 'Isn't anybody seeing this?'\" Kaplan told the jury.\n\"Did you look away?\" asked a federal prosecutor, Assistant US Attorney Maurene Comey. Kaplan said he did.\n\"And after you looked away, what did you hear?\" the prosecutor asked.\n\"Further glass crashing and chaos.\"\nWhen the prosecutor asked what, if anything, the Combs security staff did in response, Kaplan answered, \"Nothing.\"\nNo one, he said, went back to check on Ventura after Combs left the bedroom to rejoin his employees.\n\"I was 23 years old,\" Kaplan said in explanation of his own inaction. \"All I wanted to do was have a great job in the entertainment industry.\"\nUltimately, he told the jury, this and similar domestic violence incidents drove him to quit.\nAnother former personal assistant told of the night he said Diddy went looking for Suge Knight\nCombs' former personal assistant spent two days on the witness stand, and in his most dramatic testimony, described how a 2008 run for cheeseburgers at an all-night diner nearly escalated the East Coast-West Coast rap wars.\nIt started at 4 a.m. in the parking lot at Mel's Drive-In in Los Angeles, the ex-assistant, David James, testified.\nCombs' trusted security guard, Damian \"D-Roc\" Butler, noticed that Suge Knight, cofounder of rival recording studio Death Row Records, was sitting in an Escalade just a few parking spots away.\nJames, Combs' personal assistant from 2007 to 2009, testified that he was at the wheel of Combs' silver Lincoln Navigator when Knight and D-Roc faced off.\n\"What are you doing in my city?\" James, according to his testimony, remembered hearing Knight asking Combs' security guard, who had introduced himself as \"D-Roc, Biggie's boy,\" a reference to the rapper Notorious B.I.G.\nWithin moments, James and the bodyguard saw someone pass a gun to Knight and watched as four SUVs pulled up into different corners of the parking lot, he told jurors.\nJames testified that he was ordered by D-Roc to speed back to Combs' Hollywood Hills estate. There was no mention of whether they drove back with or without the cheeseburgers.\nOnce back home, and as Ventura protested in tears, Combs grabbed three guns for the ten-minute drive with D-Roc back to Mel's, testified James, who said he was still the driver.\nKnight was nowhere to be found upon their return, James said.\n\"It was the first time I realized my life was in danger,\" the former PA testified, telling jurors that he sent in his resignation soon after.\nDawn Richard testified about a brutal beating, an alleged death threat, and flowers\nDanity Kane singer Dawn Richard was the fifth prosecution witness, and her testimony on May 16 alleged that in 2009, Combs brutally beat Ventura after she took too long to cook him dinner.\n\"Where's my fucking egg?\" Richard recounted to the jury Combs shouting in 2009, as he stormed into the kitchen of his rented Los Angeles mansion.\n\"He took the skillet with the eggs in it and tried to hit her in the head, and she fell to the ground,\" Richard testified.\nVentura cowered on the floor \"in a fetal position\" as Combs punched her and kicked her, she testified. Then he dragged her upstairs by her hair, she said, adding that she then heard the sound of screaming and breaking glass from the third floor.\nThe next day, Combs called Ventura and Richard into the mansion's first-floor recording studio, she said.\n\"He said that what we saw was passion, and it was what lovers in a relationship do,\" Richard said.\nShe said Combs told the two women that \"he was trying to take us to the top, and that, where he comes from, people go missing if they say things like that, like, if people talk. And then he gave us flowers.\"\nWhile back on the stand on May 19, Richard re-emphasized that she felt this was a threat to her life.\nThe details in the testimony came as a surprise to Combs' lead defense attorney Marc Agnifilo, who called it prejudicial and \"just a drop dead lie.\"\n\"It didn't happen,\" the lawyer complained to the judge. \"And the reason we know it didn't happen is that Ms. Ventura didn't talk about it\" during her four days on the witness stand.\nOn cross-examination on May 19, Richard agreed that she only recalled the alleged death threat in speaking with prosecutors earlier this month. It had gone unmentioned, she agreed, during a half-dozen prior interviews with prosecutors.\nCombs attacked Ventura over bathroom use, prosecutor and ex-bestie say\nVentura was beaten by Combs for the most minor of perceived infractions, including taking too long in the bathroom, prosecutor Emily Johnson said in her opening statement.\n\"He beat her when she didn't answer the phone when he called. He beat her when she left a freak off without his permission,\" Johnson said.\nVentura's ex-best friend, Kerry Morgan, was called to the witness stand on May 19 and told jurors about two attacks on Ventura she witnessed, including one while on vacation in Jamaica in 2013.\nMorgan said Ventura at one point went to the bathroom at the residence where they were staying, and Combs said, \"She's taking too long.\"\n\"A few minutes later, I heard her screaming \u2014 like guttural. Terrifying,\" Morgan said. \"He was dragging her by her hair on the floor.\"\nMorgan told jurors that she saw Combs push Ventura to the ground, causing her to hit her head on the paving bricks.\n\"She didn't move. She fell on her side,\" Morgan said, adding, \"I thought she was knocked out.\"\nVentura, too, had testified that arguments with Combs would regularly result in physical abuse.\nVentura \u2014who dated Combs on and off from 2007 to 2018 \u2014 described six separate times when Combs' attacks left her with injuries, with the most severe beating occurring in Los Angeles in 2009 following a party Combs had hosted at a club called Ace of Diamonds.\nVentura said she punched Combs in the face after he called her a \"slut or a bitch\" for talking to a record producer. Combs retaliated in the back seat of a chauffeured luxury vehicle by punching and kicking Ventura throughout a ten-minute ride to the rapper's rented mansion, she said.\nShe said she hid under the back seat to escape the attack. Combs demanded she stay hidden in a hotel for a week so her bruises could heal, she said.\nThe surprising things Combs kept in his luxury NYC hotel room while waiting to be arrested\nThe prosecution's fourth witness took the witness stand briefly on May 16 to detail what she and other Homeland Security investigators say they found inside Combs' suite at Manhattan's Park Hyatt New York after his September arrest.\nCombs had checked into the luxury Midtown hotel, his lawyers have said, in case federal prosecutors in Manhattan had asked him to surrender voluntarily.\nSpecial Agent Yasin Binda told the Combs jury she photographed what her colleagues found inside the room.\nThose items included a clear plastic bag of baby oil bottles found inside a duffle bag. There were three more bottles of baby oil in his bathtub, alongside two bottles of personal lubricant.\nTwo more bottles of lubricant were recovered from a nightstand drawer, next to a prescription pill bottle she said held two small baggies containing a pink powder.\nOn the living room floor was a large blue party light of the kind Ventura testified were used to illuminate freak offs.\nSimilar bags of pink powder have previously been seized from Combs and tested positive for ecstasy and other drugs, a prosecutor had said in court the day after Combs was arrested.\nVentura's big settlements after her lawsuit and that infamous hallway-beatdown video\nIn some of her final moments on the witness stand, Ventura was asked by the defense about a legal settlement that she said she is on the verge of receiving from the InterContinental Hotel in Century City, Los Angeles.\n\"I think it was $10 million,\" Ventura said of the settlement, hesitating when asked for the total amount agreed to.\nThe InterContinental is where security cameras captured Combs beating Ventura in a hallway in 2016, as she tried to flee what prosecutors say was one of Combs' freak offs.\nThe jury was shown the infamous footage at the beginning of the trial.\nJohnson, the prosecutor, said in her opening statements that at the time of the attack, Combs paid a security guard at the hotel $100,000 in a brown paper envelope in exchange for the footage.\nCombs apologized for his actions in the video after CNN published the footage last year.\nIt was the second big-money settlement revealed in Ventura's testimony.\nEarlier in her testimony, Ventura told jurors that Combs paid her $20 million to settle her civil suit against him in 2023.\nBritney Spears and Michael B. Jordan were among the celebrities mentioned at the trial\nPop icon Britney Spears and actor Michael B. Jordan were both name-dropped on May 15, on Ventura's third day of testimony.\nDuring a cross-examination, Ventura was asked to tell the jury about the 21st birthday party Combs threw for her in 2007, at a club in Las Vegas.\nThe party was a significant moment in the Combs-Ventura story. Ventura testified that Combs, who recently signed her to his record label, gave her an uninvited kiss in a bathroom, sparking their relationship.\n\"I believe there were other celebrities there in attendance?\" defense attorney Anna Estevao asked Ventura, who answered yes, there were.\n\"Sean was there, and he brought Dallas Austin, he brought Britney Spears,\" Ventura said, referring to the \"Oops!\u2026 I Did It Again\" singer and the record producer. \"I think those were the two people that stand out to me,\" Ventura added.\nAsked how a 21-year-old of limited fame was able to attract such big names to her party, Ventura credited Combs, saying, \"That was all him.\"\nJordan's name came up as the cross-examination focused on 2015, when Combs became suspicious that she was having an affair with the actor.\n\"Is Michael B. Jordan a celebrity?\" Estevao asked.\n\"I would say so,\" Ventura answered, sounding surprised.\nVentura said she first joined Diddy's freak offs out of love\nVentura testified on May 13 that she was initially nervous, but felt a sense of responsibility to participate in Combs' freak offs.\n\"I was just in love and wanted to make him happy,\" Ventura told the jury.\nVentura testified that in 2007, Combs first proposed \"this sexual encounter that he called voyeurism, where he would watch me have a sexual encounter with a third man, specifically another man.\"\n\"I didn't want to upset him if I said it scared me or if I said anything aside from, 'OK, let's try it,'\" she said.\nJohnson said in her opening statements that Combs eventually made it Ventura's job to find and book escorts to participate in the sex encounters.\nWhile on the stand, Ventura described in detail what went on during freak offs. Prosecutors say Combs arranged, directed, and often electronically recorded the sex performances.\nVentura testified that Combs would urinate and ask escorts to urinate on her during the freak offs.\n\"It was disgusting. It was too much. It was overwhelming,\" she said. \"I choked.\"\nIf you are a survivor of sexual assault, you can call the National Sexual Assault Hotline (1-800-656-4673) or visit its website to receive confidential support.", "Harvey Weinstein convicted of top charge in sex crimes retrial.

The split verdict meted out a measure of vindication to his accusers and prosecutors \u2014 but also to Weinstein \u2014 after the landmark case was thrown into limbo. Weinstein\u2019s initial conviction five years ago seemed to cement the downfall of one of Hollywood\u2019s most powerful men in a pivotal moment for the #MeToo movement. But that conviction was overturned last year, and the case was sent back for retrial in the same Manhattan courthouse. This time, a majority-female jury convicted the former studio boss of forcibly subjecting one to a criminal sex act in 2006. But jurors acquitted Weinstein of another criminal sex act charge from 2006. And jurors were to continue deliberating on a charge that he raped another woman in 2013. Under New York law, the third-degree rape charge carries a lesser penalty than the first-degree criminal sex act offense. Weinstein, 73, denies sexually assaulting or raping anyone. Jury deliberations had teetered Wednesday as the foreperson again requested to speak to the judge about \u201ca situation\u201d he found troubling. The man \u2014 who complained Monday that other jurors were pushing people to change their minds and talking about information beyond the charges \u2014 was being questioned in private, at his request. While the jury was in court to hear the answer to an earlier request to re-hear the text of a rape law, the foreperson signaled to Judge Curtis Farber that he wanted to talk. \u201cHe said words to the effect of \u2018I can\u2019t go back in there with the other jurors,\u2019\u201d Farber explained later. The foreperson was sent to wait in a separate room, where he penned a note saying, \u201cI need to talk to you about a situation.\u201d When briefly brought into court, the foreperson said he wanted to speak in private. He, the judge, prosecutors and Weinstein\u2019s lawyers then went behind closed doors. The discussion was closed to the press and public, but Farber later said the foreperson had expressed that he didn\u2019t want to change his position \u2014 whatever it may be \u2014 and was being bullied. \u201cHe did indicate that at least one other juror made comments to the effect of \u2018I\u2019ll meet you outside one day,\u2019 and there\u2019s yelling and screaming,\u201d the judge said. Weinstein lawyer Arthur Aidala characterized the foreperson\u2019s concerns more severely, saying that the man had said he was concerned for his safety after his fellow panelist talked about meeting him outside and added, \u201cyou don\u2019t know me.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think the court is protecting this juror.

Some jurors appeared to take fresh notes Wednesday, while others sat impassively as court stenographers read aloud the requested parts of Mann\u2019s days-long testimony.

Astronomers reported Monday that the probability of the two spiral galaxies colliding is less than previously thought, with a 50-50 chance within the next 10 billion years. That\u2019s essentially a coin flip, but still better odds than previous estimates and farther out in time. \u201cAs it stands, proclamations of the impending demise of our galaxy seem greatly exaggerated,\u201d the Finnish-led team wrote in a study appearing in Nature Astronomy. While good news for the Milky Way galaxy, the latest forecast may be moot for humanity. \u201cWe likely won\u2019t live to see the benefit,\u201d lead author Till Sawala of the University of Helsinki said in an email. Already more than 4.5 billion years old, the sun is on course to run out of energy and die in another 5 billion years or so, but not before becoming so big it will engulf Mercury, Venus and possibly Earth. Even if it doesn\u2019t swallow Earth, the home planet will be left a burnt ball, its oceans long since boiled away. Sawala\u2019s international team relied on the latest observations by NASA\u2019s Hubble Space Telescope and the European Space Agency\u2019s Gaia star-surveying spacecraft to simulate the possible scenarios facing the Milky Way and next-door neighbor Andromeda. Both already collided with other galaxies in their ancient past and, according to many, seemed destined for a head-on crash.

Some predictions had that happening within 5 billion years, if not sooner. For this new study, the scientists relied on updated galaxy measurements to factor in the gravitational pull on the Milky Way\u2019s movement through the universe. They found that the effects of the neighboring Triangulum galaxy increased the likelihood of a merger between the Milky Way and Andromeda, while the Large Magellanic Cloud decreased those chances. Despite lingering uncertainty over the position, motion and mass of all these galaxies, the scientists ended up with 50-50 odds of a collision within the next 10 billion years. \u201cThe fate of our Milky Way galaxy is a subject of broad interest \u2014 not just to astronomers,\u201d said Raja GuhaThakurta of the University of California, Santa Cruz, who was not involved in the study, A full-on collision, he noted, would transform our home galaxy from a disk of stars seen as a milky band of diffuse light across the sky into a milky blob. A harmless flyby of the two galaxies could leave this stellar disk largely undisturbed, thus preserving our galaxy\u2019s name. More work is needed before the Milky Way\u2019s fate can be predicted with accuracy, according to the researchers. Further insight should help scientists better understand what\u2019s happening among galaxies even deeper in the cosmos. While our galaxy\u2019s fate remains highly uncertain, the sun\u2019s future is \u201cpretty much sealed,\u201d according to Sawala. \u201cOf course, there is also a very significant chance that humanity will bring an end to itself still much before that, without any need for astrophysical help.\u201d Support PBS News Hour Your donation makes a difference in these uncertain times.

For this new study, the scientists relied on updated galaxy measurements to factor in the gravitational pull on the Milky Way\u2019s movement through the universe. They found that the effects of the neighboring Triangulum galaxy increased the likelihood of a merger between the Milky Way and Andromeda, while the Large Magellanic Cloud decreased those chances. Despite lingering uncertainty over the position, motion and mass of all these galaxies, the scientists ended up with 50-50 odds of a collision within the next 10 billion years. \u201cThe fate of our Milky Way galaxy is a subject of broad interest \u2014 not just to astronomers,\u201d said Raja GuhaThakurta of the University of California, Santa Cruz, who was not involved in the study, A full-on collision, he noted, would transform our home galaxy from a disk of stars seen as a milky band of diffuse light across the sky into a milky blob. A harmless flyby of the two galaxies could leave this stellar disk largely undisturbed, thus preserving our galaxy\u2019s name. More work is needed before the Milky Way\u2019s fate can be predicted with accuracy, according to the researchers. Further insight should help scientists better understand what\u2019s happening among galaxies even deeper in the cosmos. While our galaxy\u2019s fate remains highly uncertain, the sun\u2019s future is \u201cpretty much sealed,\u201d according to Sawala. \u201cOf course, there is also a very significant chance that humanity will bring an end to itself still much before that, without any need for astrophysical help.\u201d Support PBS News Hour Your donation makes a difference in these uncertain times.

Israeli-supported group says they were aid workers World Jun 12, 2025 2:38 PM EDT CAIRO (AP) \u2014 A unit of Gaza\u2019s Hamas-run police force said it killed 12 members of an Israeli-backed Palestinian militia after detaining them early Thursday. An Israel-supported aid group, however, said the dead were its aid workers, eight of whom were killed when Hamas attacked their bus. It was not immediately possible to verify the competing claims or confirm the identities of those killed. The militia, led by Yasser Abu Shabab, said its fighters had attacked Hamas and killed five militants but made no mention of its own casualties. It also accused Hamas of detaining and killing aid workers. The deaths were the latest sign of turmoil surrounding the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a private contractor that Israel says will replace the U.N. in distributing food to Gaza\u2019s more than 2 million people. The past two weeks, dozens of Palestinians have been killed and hundreds wounded in near daily shootings as they try to reach GHF centers, with witnesses saying Israeli troops nearby have repeatedly opened fire. On Wednesday, at least 13 people were killed and 170 wounded when Israeli forces fired toward a crowd of Palestinians near a GHF center in central Gaza, according to al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. The military said it fired warning shots overnight at a gathering that posed a threat, hundreds of meters (yards) from the aid site. Internet and phone lines, meanwhile, were down across Gaza, according to telecom provider Paltel and the Palestinian telecoms authority. They said a key line was severed during an Israeli operation and that the military would not allow technicians into the area to repair it. The Israeli military said it was looking into the reports. The U.N. humanitarian office, known as OCHA, said emergency services were cut off because of the outage, and civilians cannot call ambulances. It said most U.N. agencies and aid groups could not reach their staff on the ground. \u2018They were aid workers\u2019 Israel has barred international journalists from entering Gaza, making it difficult to confirm what happened in the killings early Wednesday near the southern city of Khan Younis. GHF said Hamas attacked a bus carrying more than two dozen of its Palestinian aid workers, killing at least eight and wounding others. It said it feared some had been abducted. \u201cWe condemn this heinous and deliberate attack in the strongest possible terms,\u201d it said. \u201cThese were aid workers. Humanitarians. Fathers, brothers, sons, and friends, who were risking their lives every day to help others.\u201d The Israeli military circulated GHF\u2019s statement but declined to provide its own account of what happened. Rev. Johnnie Moore, a Christian evangelical adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump who was recently appointed head of GHF, called the killings \u201cabsolute evil.\u201d READ MORE: Gaza health officials say 55,000 Palestinians have died in Israel-Hamas war The U.N.\u2019s OCHA said it could not confirm the circumstances of the killings but said \u201ccivilians must never be attacked, let alone those trying to access or provide food amid mass starvation.\u201d GHF says its staff at the centers include unarmed Palestinian employees. Much of the staff are armed international contractors, mainly Americans, guarding the centers. The Abu Shabab group fighters are deployed inside the Israeli military zones that surround the GHF centers, according to witnesses. Earlier this week, witnesses said Abu Shabab militiamen had opened fire on people en route to a GHF aid hub, killing and wounding many. GHF says it does not work with the Abu Shabab group. Last week, Israel acknowledged it is supporting armed groups of Palestinians opposed to Hamas. Hamas says it killed traitors Hamas has rejected the GHF system and threatened to kill any Palestinians who cooperate with the Israeli military. The Sahm police unit, which Hamas says it established to combat looting, released video footage showing several dead men lying in the street, saying they were Abu Shabab fighters who had been detained and killed for collaborating with Israel. It was not possible to verify the images or the claims around them. Mohammed Abu Amin, a Khan Younis resident who was at the scene, said a crowd celebrated the killings, shouting \u201cGod is greatest\u201d and condemning those killed as traitors. Ghassan Duhine, who identifies himself as deputy commander of the Abu Shabab group and a major in the Palestinian Authority\u2019s security forces, issued a statement saying Abu Shabab fighters had clashed with Sahm and killed five. He denied that the bodies in Sahm\u2019s images were the group\u2019s fighters. The Palestinian Authority, led by rivals of Hamas and based in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, has denied any connection to the Abu Shabab group. But many of the militiamen identify themselves as PA officers. Aid initiative already marred by controversy Aid workers say Gaza is at risk of famine because of Israel\u2019s renewed military campaign and its 2 1/2 month ban o n imports of food, fuel, medicine to Gaza, which was slightly eased in mid-May. OCHA warned that fuel \u201cmay very soon run out\u201d at 67 of the 85 remaining partially functioning hospitals and health care centers in Gaza, meaning vital equipment would go dead. Despite the easing of the blockade, Israel has still not allowed fuel to enter. OCHA said the military gave it permission to retrieve fuel stored in northern Gaza after weeks of denials, but the team sent Wednesday had to turn back because of Israeli shelling in the area. The United Nations and major aid groups have rejected the GHF distribution system. They say it is unable to meet Gaza\u2019s needs and allows Israel to use food as a weapon to enact its military objectives, including plans to move Gaza\u2019s entire population to southern Gaza near the GHF hubs.

Give Now By \u2014 Samy Magdy, Associated Press Samy Magdy, Associated Press By \u2014 Kareem Chehayeb, Associated Press Kareem Chehayeb, Associated Press\nCAIRO (AP) \u2014 A unit of Gaza\u2019s Hamas-run police force said it killed 12 members of an Israeli-backed Palestinian militia after detaining them early Thursday. An Israel-supported aid group, however, said the dead were its aid workers, eight of whom were killed when Hamas attacked their bus. It was not immediately possible to verify the competing claims or confirm the identities of those killed. The militia, led by Yasser Abu Shabab, said its fighters had attacked Hamas and killed five militants but made no mention of its own casualties. It also accused Hamas of detaining and killing aid workers. The deaths were the latest sign of turmoil surrounding the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a private contractor that Israel says will replace the U.N. in distributing food to Gaza\u2019s more than 2 million people. The past two weeks, dozens of Palestinians have been killed and hundreds wounded in near daily shootings as they try to reach GHF centers, with witnesses saying Israeli troops nearby have repeatedly opened fire. On Wednesday, at least 13 people were killed and 170 wounded when Israeli forces fired toward a crowd of Palestinians near a GHF center in central Gaza, according to al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. The military said it fired warning shots overnight at a gathering that posed a threat, hundreds of meters (yards) from the aid site. Internet and phone lines, meanwhile, were down across Gaza, according to telecom provider Paltel and the Palestinian telecoms authority. They said a key line was severed during an Israeli operation and that the military would not allow technicians into the area to repair it. The Israeli military said it was looking into the reports. The U.N. humanitarian office, known as OCHA, said emergency services were cut off because of the outage, and civilians cannot call ambulances. It said most U.N. agencies and aid groups could not reach their staff on the ground. \u2018They were aid workers\u2019 Israel has barred international journalists from entering Gaza, making it difficult to confirm what happened in the killings early Wednesday near the southern city of Khan Younis. GHF said Hamas attacked a bus carrying more than two dozen of its Palestinian aid workers, killing at least eight and wounding others. It said it feared some had been abducted. \u201cWe condemn this heinous and deliberate attack in the strongest possible terms,\u201d it said. \u201cThese were aid workers. Humanitarians. Fathers, brothers, sons, and friends, who were risking their lives every day to help others.\u201d The Israeli military circulated GHF\u2019s statement but declined to provide its own account of what happened. Rev. Johnnie Moore, a Christian evangelical adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump who was recently appointed head of GHF, called the killings \u201cabsolute evil.\u201d READ MORE: Gaza health officials say 55,000 Palestinians have died in Israel-Hamas war The U.N.\u2019s OCHA said it could not confirm the circumstances of the killings but said \u201ccivilians must never be attacked, let alone those trying to access or provide food amid mass starvation.\u201d GHF says its staff at the centers include unarmed Palestinian employees. Much of the staff are armed international contractors, mainly Americans, guarding the centers. The Abu Shabab group fighters are deployed inside the Israeli military zones that surround the GHF centers, according to witnesses. Earlier this week, witnesses said Abu Shabab militiamen had opened fire on people en route to a GHF aid hub, killing and wounding many. GHF says it does not work with the Abu Shabab group.

John Boozman, for example, indicated the Senate may rewrite a proposal in the House-passed bill that would shift some of the cost of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides food aid to low-income people, to state governments.\n\u201cWe can do whatever we want to do,\u201d the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee chairman said when asked by States Newsroom about amending that policy.\nThe final deal \u2014 intended to extend the 2017 tax cuts \u2014 cannot lose more than three GOP senators and still make it back across the Capitol to the House for final approval, since all Democrats are expected to oppose the bill. Thune only needs a majority vote in the Senate for the special process being used by Republicans.\nInternal debates about just how to rework the Trump-backed tax and spending cuts measure began in the first week of June during meetings on Capitol Hill and at the White House, as GOP senators began critiquing the House-passed package line-by-line to ensure it complies with their strict rules for the complex reconciliation process and their policy goals.\nRepublicans said during interviews that several provisions in the House version likely won\u2019t comply with the chamber\u2019s Byrd rule, which could force lawmakers to toss out some provisions.\nComplicating all of it was the very public back-and-forth between not just Trump but GOP leaders and former White House adviser Musk over the bill, which Musk on social media labeled \u201ca disgusting abomination\u201d and a \u201cbig, ugly spending bill\u201d for its effect on the deficit and debt limit. \u201cKILL the BILL,\u201d Musk said on X, the platform he owns. Senate leaders so far have dismissed Musk\u2019s criticisms.\nFragile House coalition\nThe talks, and whatever the legislation looks like after a marathon amendment voting session expected in late June, have already raised deep concerns among House GOP lawmakers, who will have to vote on the bill again in order to send it to Trump.\nThe extremely narrow majorities mean House Republican leaders cannot lose more than four of their own members if all the lawmakers in that chamber vote on the party-line bill.\nAny changes the Senate makes could unbalance the fragile coalition of votes Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., cobbled together last month for a 215-214 vote. But GOP senators are adamant they will amend the legislation.\nComplicating matters is a new report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that shows the proposed changes to tax law, Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and higher education aid wouldn\u2019t actually help to reduce deficits during the next decade but raise them by more than $2.4 trillion.\nThe numbers are the exact opposite for what Republicans hoped their sweeping tax and spending cuts package would accomplish.\nScrutiny begins\nThe first stop for the House-passed reconciliation package in the Senate appears to be the parliamentarian\u2019s office, where staff have begun evaluating whether each provision in the current version of the bill complies with the upper chamber\u2019s strict rules.\nBoozman said staff on his panel have already begun meeting with the parliamentarian to go over the House provisions within its jurisdiction.\nHe expects that section of the package will have to change to comply with the strict rules that govern the reconciliation process in the Senate and to better fit that chamber\u2019s policy goals.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t really decide exactly what we want to use in the House version until we know what\u2019s eligible,\u201d Boozman said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some other ideas too that we asked them about. But we need to know, of the ideas that we have, what would be viable options as far as being Byrd eligible.\u201d\nThe Byrd rule, which is actually a law, requires reconciliation bills to address federal revenue, spending, or the debt limit. This generally bars lawmakers from using the special budget process to change policies that don\u2019t have a significant impact on those three areas.\nAlabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville, who is campaigning to become his home state\u2019s next governor, said pushing some of the cost of the nutrition program to states may be problematic.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to send more costs to the states. Most states can\u2019t afford that, so we want to take care of people, but we need people to go back to work,\u201d Tuberville said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a forever entitlement. It\u2019s for part-time, you know, take care of yourself until you get a job, go back to work and let people that need it really, really get it.\u201d\nRural hospitals on edge\nSenate GOP leaders will have to navigate how best to reduce federal spending on Medicaid, the state-federal health program for lower-income people and some with disabilities, that is relied on by tens of millions of Americans, many of whom are loyal Republican voters.\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects that 7.8 million people would lose access to Medicaid during the next decade if the House\u2019s policy changes are implemented as written.\nThere are also concerns among GOP lawmakers about how losing the revenue that comes with treating Medicaid patients would impact rural health care access and hospitals.\nMissouri Sen. Josh Hawley said under no circumstances would he vote for a bill that cuts benefits to Medicaid recipients and is worried about how provisions in the House package would affect rural hospitals.\n\u201cThey\u2019re very concerned about it, rightly so,\u201d Hawley said, referring to conversations he\u2019s had with health care systems in his home state.\n\u201cThis is something that we need to work on. I don\u2019t know why we would penalize rural hospitals,\u201d he added. \u201cIf you want to reduce health care spending, then cap the price of prescription drugs. I mean, that\u2019s the way to do it. If you want to get major savings in the health care sector, don\u2019t close rural hospitals, don\u2019t take away benefits from working people. Cap the costs, cap the price that (the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) is going to pay for prescription drugs.\u201d\nWest Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito said she\u2019s not yet come to a decision about whether to keep, amend, or completely scrap some of the House changes to Medicaid.\n\u201cI talked to a lot of our hospitals when I was home to see what the impacts would be, because we have a very high Medicaid population,\u201d Capito said. \u201cI want to see it work and be preserved, but I want it to be there for future generations. And it\u2019s just getting way out of control on the spend side. So right now, we\u2019re looking at everything.\u201d\nLouisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy \u2014 chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee \u2014 said he doesn\u2019t expect all of the health care provisions in the House bill make it through the \u201cByrd bath\u201d with the parliamentarian. But he declined to go into detail.\n\u201cSome of it is more regulatory, that\u2019s all I can say,\u201d Cassidy said.\nWest Virginia\u2019s Sen. Jim Justice said he is in favor of requiring some Medicaid enrollees to work, participate in community service, or attend an educational program at least 80 hours a month to stay on the program, a sentiment shared by many of his GOP colleagues.\n\u201cI\u2019m good with every bit of that,\u201d he said.\nBut Justice expects the Senate will make its own changes to the package and that it will be \u201cproud of their own pond.\u201d\n\u201cAny frog that\u2019s not proud of your own pond\u2019s not much of a frog,\u201d Justice said.\nHe did not go into detail on what those changes would entail.\nSALT shakers\nThe state and local tax deduction, or SALT, represents another tightrope for Thune, who is no fan of the changes made in the House. But he has said repeatedly this week he understands altering that language too much could mean a Senate-amended version of the bill never makes it back through the House to actually become law.\nThune said outside the White House following a June 4 meeting with Trump and others that there will very likely be changes to SALT.\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a single Republican senator who cares much about the SALT issue,\u201d Thune said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not an issue that plays.\u201d States that are most affected generally don\u2019t elect Republicans to the Senate.\nThe House tax-writing panel originally proposed raising the SALT cap from $10,000 to $30,000, but Johnson had to raise that to $40,000 in order to secure votes from House Republicans who represent higher tax states like California, New Jersey and New York. The revised cap would benefit more high-income taxpayers in their states.\n\u201cIn 2017, that was one of the best reforms we had in the bill,\u201d Thune said. \u201cBut we understand it\u2019s about 51 and 218. So we will work with our House counterparts and with the White House to try to get that issue in a place where we can deliver the votes and get the bill across the finish line.\u201d\nRepublicans hold 53 seats in the Senate, but can rely on Vice President J.D. Vance to break a tied vote if necessary.\nAt least 218 House lawmakers must vote to pass bills when all 435 seats are filled. But with three vacancies at the moment, legislation can move through that chamber with 216 votes. The GOP has 220 seats at the moment, meaning Johnson can afford four defections on party-line bills.\nNorth Dakota Sen. John Hoeven told reporters this week that he\u2019d like to see GOP senators rework the SALT section of the bill, even if that causes challenges for Speaker Johnson\u2019s ability to pass a final version.\n\u201cLet\u2019s talk about SALT, for example. The House has a very large SALT number. The Senate is probably going to take a look at that,\u201d Hoeven said. \u201cThere\u2019ll be a lot of areas we can look at. There\u2019ll be other things we\u2019re going to look at. We\u2019d like to get to $2 trillion in savings.\u201d\nOhio Sen. Bernie Moreno joined in putting his House colleagues on notice that they likely won\u2019t get the agreement they struck with the speaker in the final version of the bill.\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to make common-sense changes. For example, the SALT cap, by the way, something that definitely helps very wealthy people in blue states,\u201d Moreno said. \u201cI think that cap, the 400% increase, is too much, so we\u2019re going to work on tweaking that.\u201d\nHawley, of Missouri, speaking more generally about the tax provisions, said he would like the Senate to make sure middle-class Americans benefit from the tax changes, just as much as companies.\n\u201cI want to be clear, I\u2019m in favor of additional tax relief for working people. So my view is this corporate tax rate, which they lowered in 2017, they made that permanent back then. I know some workers that would like permanent tax relief,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cSo I think it\u2019s imperative that we do some addition to tax relief for workers. So I think that\u2019s important.\u201d\nA new $4 trillion debt limit\nDeficit hawks in the Senate have also voiced objections to raising the nation\u2019s debt limit by $4 trillion, arguing that GOP leaders haven\u2019t done enough to assuage their concerns about the nation\u2019s fiscal trajectory.\nKentucky Sen. Rand Paul argued that the debt limit increase is more about next year\u2019s midterm elections than good governance.\n\u201cThis is really about avoiding having to talk about the debt during election times because people like to go home and talk to the Rotary or the Lions Club and tell them how they\u2019re fiscally conservative and they\u2019re against debt,\u201d Paul said. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing to them to have to vote to keep raising the debt. But they\u2019re unwilling to have the courage to actually look at all spending.\u201d\nPaul suggested that House Republicans created problems by inflating some of the spending levels in their package, including to continue construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Paul is chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n\u201cThe $46.5 billion for the wall is eight times higher than the current cost of the wall. If you\u2019re going to do 1,000 miles, you can actually do it for $6.5 billion. They want $46.5 billion,\u201d Paul said. \u201cWe can\u2019t be fiscally conservative until it comes to the border, and then we\u2019re no longer fiscally conservative.\u201d\nThe border wall has been a constant focus for Trump, who made it a central part of his 2016 presidential campaign, when he said repeatedly that the United States would build it and Mexico would pay for it.\nSouth Carolina\u2019s Lindsey Graham, chairman of the Budget Committee, hinted during a brief interview that Congress can only cut so much spending without going near programs like Social Security, which accounted for $1.5 trillion in expenditures last year, or Medicare, which spent $865 billion. Both are normally considered untouchable.\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to make some changes to try to find more spending reductions. I think that\u2019s a fair criticism of the bill, but you can\u2019t do Social Security by law,\u201d Graham said, referring to one of the many rules that govern the reconciliation process. \u201cNobody\u2019s proposed anything in the Medicare area.\u201d\nGraham added that \u201ctrying to make the bill more fiscally responsible is a good thing, but we need to pass it.\u201d\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

The \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act\u201d (let\u2019s say \u201cOBBBA\u201d) is President Donald Trump\u2019s signature agenda item in Congress. It will affect the daily lives of tens of millions of Americans. It is a massive project, with potentially the largest tax cuts, spending cuts and additions to the national debt in U.S. history. WATCH: Can Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d make it through the Senate? This week, we have a critical, new development to dive into: the Senate Finance Committee\u2019s own draft of how it wants to handle tax cuts and Medicaid cuts. (For the most adventurous among us, all 549 pages can be found here.) The big picture Tax cuts. The Senate draft would add and lengthen some tax cuts, both for businesses and individuals. Green energy cuts. It would slightly delay the elimination of tax credits for solar and wind energy. The Senate draft would push back cuts for nuclear, geothermal and hydropower far more significantly. Medicaid cuts. It would cut Medicaid more than the House-passed bill. OK, let\u2019s go a little deeper.

Photo by Nathan Howard/Reuters Some tax specifics Individual tax rates. Senate and House Republicans are in sync on this. They would make current tax rates permanent. Without action, nearly all individuals will see a tax increase. Standard deductions. The Senate draft would give most adults a bigger tax deduction from the start. Without extending Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts, the standard deduction that many individuals take to lower their tax burden is slated to decrease nearly in half at the end of the year. The Senate would not just keep but raise the deduction amounts \u2014 to $16,000 for individuals and $32,000 for married couples filing jointly. Child tax credit. The current tax credit of $2,000 per child is set to drop to $1,000 at the end of the year. The Senate would raise the credit to $2,200 permanently. The House would raise the credit to $2,500, but only until 2028. Green energy A slash to green energy funds. The House and Senate are both moving to eliminate major tax credits for wind and solar from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. But the Senate gives a slightly longer phase-out, allowing a partial tax credit for projects that start construction next year or in 2027. The House would end the credit almost as soon as the bill is enacted. Medicaid Targeting the \u201cprovider\u201d tax. This is the most notable cut that the Senate draft is adding. Right now, states use a loophole to help them get more federal dollars for Medicaid. They tax hospitals and doctors (a \u201cprovider tax\u201d) and spend that money back with the hospitals and doctors. The more states spend, the more the federal government will match. A cut on this tax. For states that expanded Medicaid, the Senate draft would gradually reduce the maximum amount of provider taxes, which is currently up to 6%, until it reaches a 3.5% threshold by 2031. Many Republicans like this reform, but others say it would significantly cut funds available for Medicaid. The House bill would block new provider taxes. Work requirements. Both the House and Senate would add an 80-hours-a-month work requirement for \u201cable-bodied\u201d adults, or those without disabilities, on Medicaid. The Senate makes one significant change: exempting parents of children under 14 years old from the requirement. (There currently is no federal work requirement for Medicaid.) What now? This Senate version is experiencing some initial turbulence. Four Republican senators have openly questioned the Medicaid cuts in the House bill: Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Jerry Moran of Kansas, Susan Collins of Maine and Josh Hawley of Missouri. And now, West Virginia Sen. Jim Justice has told a Semafor reporter that he wants the Senate\u2019s Medicaid section to revert to the House version, which would ban new or increased provider taxes. Hawley told me Tuesday that the cut to the provider tax was a total surprise to him and others. Trump, too, was surprised when alerted about the change and its ramifications for rural hospitals, Hawley said. This is not unusual. Big bills often have big problems when they are released. But. Republicans are trying to get this historic legislation through Congress \u2014 not just the Senate \u2014 in the next two weeks. At this point in the process, similar large bills (think the Affordable Care Act) usually take months to get through the Senate and back through the House again. Republicans are determined to pass a version of the bill, but increasingly my sources are saying the question is \u201cnot if, but when.\u201d Support PBS News Hour Your donation makes a difference in these uncertain times.

Give Now", "Speaker Johnson launches sales mission as \u2018big, beautiful bill\u2019 hits the Senate. Speaker Johnson launches sales mission as \u2018big, beautiful bill\u2019 hits the Senate\nSpeaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) is on a sales mission for the \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d full of President Trump\u2019s legislative priorities, defending its contents amid a wave of criticism from his party about the depth of spending cuts, significance of Medicaid changes and the rollback of green-energy tax credits.\nJohnson said in multiple interviews that he sent a \u201clong text message\u201d to Elon Musk vouching for the bill after the billionaire tech mogul said he was disappointed with the legislation, complaining that it undermines the cost-cutting work of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), his brainchild.\nThe Speaker has also gone on a cable news blitz, pushing back on concerns Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) are voicing about the deficit impact of the bill, tearing into the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office\u2019s math, and arguing that the benefits of the package outweigh its shortcomings.\nAnd now, Speaker Johnson is looking to ease concerns of conservatives by promising to quickly stage a vote on a bill that would claw back billions of dollars in federal funding \u2014 reflecting some of the cuts DOGE has made \u2014 and signaling there may be more to come after the \u201cone big, beautiful bill\u201d gets to the president\u2019s desk.\n\u201cThis is not the only reconciliation bill,\u201d Johnson said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a second budget reconciliation bill that follows after this, and we\u2019re beginning next week the appropriations process, which is the spending bills for government.\u201d\nThe full-court press comes as the bill is making its debut in the Senate, where Republicans say they plan to make changes to the sprawling package, threatening to erode the delicate support for the legislation in the narrow House GOP majority.\nJohnson has publicly and privately urged his upper chamber colleagues to keep their alterations minimal.\nAt least on one issue, the Senate appears to be listening.\nSen. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.), a former House member who has acted as a liaison between the two chambers, told The Hill last week that he does not expect the Senate to change the $40,000 state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap in the bill, which had emerged as a major sticking point in the House.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we can change that,\u201d Mullin said. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can drop it. I think if you go below $40,000, I think it causes issues.\u201d\nSALT had been one of the biggest questions heading into the Senate\u2019s turn with the bill. While quadrupling the deduction cap from $10,000 to $40,000 was a central priority for moderate House Republicans from high-tax blue states like New York, New Jersey and California, the issue has no GOP advocates in the Senate \u2014 a dynamic those in the upper chamber openly recognized.\nAs of now, the House is winning the argument.\n\u201cIn the Senate, we don\u2019t have any dog in the fight, right? Zero,\u201d Mullin said. \u201cBut in the House, it does, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a do-or-die on our side.\u201d\nWhile the SALT question may be adjudicated, the Senate still has to make decisions on a host of high-stakes issues, including whether to beef up spending cuts, water down Medicaid changes or minimize the rollback of green-energy tax credits \u2014 any of which could derail the House\u2019s tenuous equilibrium.\nMullin, for his part, said the entire Republican trifecta has been closely coordinating throughout the process.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been talking together the whole time,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, the House and the Senate and the White House have been talking this whole time together, so I don\u2019t see there being a huge difference between us.\u201d\nBut to keep the trains on the track in the House, Johnson will have to continue his messaging blitz and put out any fires that arise as the Senate parses the package\u2019s particulars.\nIt is a role shift for Johnson, who spent months in closed-door meetings corralling the fractious House Republican Conference around the behemoth bill \u2014 culminating in a through-the-night saga on the House floor to pass it out of the chamber as fast as possible after securing the support it needed.\nBut while Johnson met his Memorial Day deadline to pass the bill out of the House after last-minute negotiations, the rest of the Republican ecosystem is not yet on board with its contents \u2014 or up to speed on what made the cut and what did not.\nThat\u2019s led to Johnson\u2019s blitz being as much of an education campaign as it is an advocacy mission.\n\u201cThis is not a spending bill. This is a reconciliation package. It is reconciling the budget,\u201d Johnson said on \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re beginning next week the appropriations process, which is the spending bills for government. And you\u2019re going to see a lot of the DOGE cuts and a lot of this new fiscal restraint reflected in what Congress does next,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cSo stay tuned, this is not the end-all, be-all.\u201d\nIn a show of that commitment, Johnson has pledged to swiftly act on a package from the White House expected to hit Congress this week that would mark the first codification of DOGE cuts \u2014 action that the outraged conservative base had been clamoring for. The $9.4 billion rescission package would claw back spending from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds NPR and PBS, as well as from the largely dismantled U.S. Agency for International Development.\nAnd as for those pesky budget projections forecasting the bill adds trillions to the national debt over a decade, Johnson argues the budget scorers don\u2019t adequately assess the impact of economic growth spurred by the tax cut extension or other Trump policies.\n\u201cThe president\u2019s extraordinary policies are producing great things for the country. The tariff policy that was so controversial in the beginning is having an extraordinary effect on the U.S. economy,\u201d Johnson said, in contrast to numerous analysts who say the tariffs will damage economic growth.\nDespite the looming fights in the Senate, Johnson remains confident the party will meet its self-imposed deadline of enacting the package by July 4 \u2014 betting he will be able to pull another rabbit out of his hat.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve always discounted us,\u201d Johnson said Sunday. \u201cI mean, I said I would do it out of the House before Memorial Day, and I was laughed at when I said that back early part of the year. But we beat it by four days, OK? We\u2019re going to get this done, the sooner the better.\u201d\n\u201cBecause all these extraordinary benefits that we\u2019re talking about have to happen as soon as possible,\u201d he added. And I\u2019m convinced that the Senate will do it, do the right thing, send it back to us. We\u2019re going to get it to the president\u2019s desk, and we\u2019re all going to have a glorious celebration on Independence Day, by July Fourth when he gets this signed into law.\u201d\nAl Weaver contributed.\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc.

We need to set the record straight and see that we are stronger united.\u201d\nEducators in the United States unwilling to turn their lessons into press releases for Israel\u2019s far-right prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu have faced harsh censure, especially since Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people. Since then, Israel has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, enforced collective starvation, bombed schools and hospitals, and committed a host of other war crimes\u2014atrocities that honest educators believe students have a right to learn about.\nRadhika Sainath, a senior staff attorney at Palestine Legal, which defends the free speech rights of Palestine advocates, revealed the alarming escalation in these attacks: \u201cWe\u2019ve had an exponential surge in requests for legal help. It has been like nothing we\u2019ve seen before.\u201d In just the month of October 2023, the organization responded to nearly two hundred reports of \u201csuppression of Palestinian rights advocacy\u201d\u2014almost as many incidents as they addressed in all of the previous year.\nThe repression of education about Palestine has contributed to the proliferation of violence against Palestinian youth. Six-year-old Wadea Al-Fayoume was stabbed by his family\u2019s landlord twenty-six times and killed in October 2023. In November 2023, Hisham Awartani, Tahseen Ali, and Kenan Abdulhamid, three Palestinian college students, were walking together in Burlington, Vermont\u2014two of them wearing kaffiyehs\u2014when a hateful assailant shot and wounded all three and left Awartani paralyzed from the waist down.\nThe crackdown on advocates for Palestinian rights has taken various forms. According to Sainath, individuals have faced consequences ranging from job terminations due to supportive tweets or social media messages about Palestinian human rights to student critics of Israel being doxed and listed on a website called \u201cCollege Terror List,\u201d aiming to render them unemployable. Death threats have even been made to students and teachers.\nAn elementary charter school in Los Angeles fired two teachers for sharing \u201ca lesson on the genocide in Palestine.\u201d A school in Illinois banned students from wearing a kaffiyeh scarf\u2014a Palestinian cultural symbol. In Palm Beach County, Florida, a first-grade teacher was investigated by the school district and put on administrative leave for asking the superintendent to \u201cpublicly recognize the Palestinian community\u201d while communicating about the violence in the Middle East. Four teachers in Montgomery County, Maryland, were placed on administrative leave for public expressions of support for Palestinians. The Decatur, Georgia, school district suspended their equity coordinator for sharing \u201cResources for Learning & Actions to Support Gaza.\u201d In Fort Lauderdale, Florida, fifteen-year-old Palestinian American Jad Abuhamda was expelled from Pine Crest School because of social media posts\u2014not from him, but from his mother who wrote about the \u201ccollective brutality\u201d that Israel was waging against Palestinians.\nSeveral universities have suspended campus chapters of Students for Justice in Palestine, including Columbia, Brandeis, George Washington, and Rutgers. Many politicians\u2014both Republicans and Democrats\u2014were more outraged by the students who camped out in tents on college campuses in the spring of 2024 to protest genocide than they were by Israel bombing Palestinian refugees in their tents. Many of these peaceful college student protesters were arrested, suspended, or denied graduation because they spoke out against genocide.\nThese neo-McCarthyist tactics to prohibit honest education about Palestine aren\u2019t new, even if they are intensified. Steven Salaita was fired from the University of Illinois after he publicly criticized Israel\u2019s 2014 military assault on Gaza with tweets such as, \u201cOnly Israel can murder around 300 children in the span of a few weeks and insist that it is the victim.\u201d Bahia Amawai was an educator who worked for a school in a suburban district outside of Austin, Texas, as a speech-language pathologist working with elementary school children with autism, disabilities, and speech impediments. She was fired in 2018 when she refused to sign what amounted to a pro-Israel loyalty oath that demanded she \u201cnot boycott Israel during the term of the contract.\u201d\nAnd it isn\u2019t only red states that have attacked educators critical of Israeli policies or education that seeks to allow students to see the full humanity of Palestinians. Nearly fifty years after the Third World Liberation Front strikes at San Francisco State and University of California, Berkeley, created the first ethnic studies courses, California governor Gavin Newsom signed a bill in September 2016 to create an Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, which would \u201cprovide direction for districts interested in implementing high school ethnic studies courses.\u201d\nIn August 2019, the draft curriculum went up for public comment. However, a \u201cwell-organized right-wing campaign headed by a pro-Israel lobby committed to preventing any critical discussion of Israel, flooded the CDE [California Department of Education] demands to remove the Arab American curriculum\u2014especially all mention of Palestine\u2014and the anti-colonial, anti- racist framing of the entire curriculum.\u201d\nThen the California Department of Education and Governor Newsom caved. A formidable coalition in support of California\u2019s Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum emerged, including the Association for Asian American Studies, the Arab American Studies Association, Black Lives Matter, Jewish Voice for Peace, veterans of the 1968 student strikes for ethnic studies, and many internationally recognized scholars, such as Angela Davis and Robin D. G. Kelley. \u201cProgressive Jewish educators and activists made it clear that the pro-Israel lobby does not speak for them,\u201d wrote truth teacher and co-coordinator of the Teach Palestine Project, Jody Sokolower.\nDuring this struggle, a student named Hedaia addressed California\u2019s Instructional Quality Commission, the body charged with overseeing the process. \u201cI am a Palestinian Arab student,\u201d she said, adding:\nDo you know how it feels to be called a terrorist by your teacher and classmates? It\u2019s dehumanizing. As much as I tried to assimilate at my high school, I was always a scary Arab with a hard name to pronounce. This is how I grew up, facing Islamophobic and Arab slurs in and out of school. Explaining myself in classes where Arabs and Muslims are mentioned for one day each year: on Sept. 11. My people are not the stereotypes. We are teachers, students, health care workers, politicians, everything. By removing Arab American studies from the central curriculum, you are removing the existence of people who have contributed to this society and need to be represented in a positive light. Representation matters.\nThere is no question that antisemitism is also on the rise; but it\u2019s important to understand that the uncritical race theorists who have attacked antiracist teaching are the same ones who are primarily responsible for the rise in anti-Jewish sentiment\u2014not Palestinians or hundreds of millions of people around the world who have participated in the movement for a ceasefire in Gaza. Remember that when protestors confronted the neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, North Carolina, who chanted, \u201cJews will not replace us,\u201d then president Donald Trump said there were \u201cfine people on both sides.\u201d This contributed to the fact that when Trump attacked CRT in the wake of the 2020 uprising for Black lives, anti-Black education policy also coincided with a rise in antisemitism.\nIn 2022, the McMinn County School Board in Tennessee voted unanimously to ban the Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning graphic novel Maus. In Texas, the Carroll Independent School District held a training for educators, where the executive director of curriculum and instruction explained in an online forum to teachers how to determine which books teachers can keep in classroom libraries.\nIn despicable remarks captured on an audio recording, the director instructed teachers to remember the requirements of the new Texas anti-CRT law, \u201cand make sure that if you have a book on the Holocaust, that you have one that has an opposing, that has other perspectives\u201d\u2014an abhorrent, antisemitic expression of uncritical race theory that asserts there could be a legitimate way to deny the Holocaust happened or show support for the Nazi genocide of more than six million Jewish people.\nIn the context of Governor Ron DeSantis\u2019s \u201cStop WOKE\u201d act, a school in Indian River County, Florida, banned the book Anne Frank\u2019s Diary: The Graphic Adaptation\u2014a 2019 retelling of the diary Anne Frank wrote while hiding out for two years with her family during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands. In addition, DeSantis directed his department of education to ban two textbooks about the Holocaust.\nAt the same time DeSantis\u2019s policies have bolstered antisemitism, the governor is one of the most zealous defenders of Israel\u2019s genocide of Palestinians. For example, he has called for banning Palestinian refugees from entering the United States and boasted that he sent weapons and ammunition to Israel from the state of Florida to aid the destruction of Gaza.\nAdditionally, despite his outrage over cancel culture, DeSantis issued a ban on Students for Justice in Palestine on Florida\u2019s college campuses. This aligns with a larger trend where the right suppresses educational initiatives that aim to honestly confront antisemitism while unequivocally endorsing Israel\u2019s attack on Palestinians. This support for Israel isn\u2019t rooted in genuine concern for the Jewish community; rather, it serves to bolster the Israeli state as a strategic ally to the United States in the oil-rich Middle East.\nChristopher Rufo demonstrated this when he offered his colonial strategy for using education to help maintain Israeli and US military power: \u201cConservatives need to create a strong association between Hamas, BLM [Black Lives Matter], DSA [Democratic Socialists of America], and academic \u2018decolonization\u2019 in the public mind. Connect the dots, then attack, delegitimize, and discredit. Make the center-left disavow them. Make them political untouchables.\u201d\nThe strategy of trying to make anyone who opposes genocide in Gaza a \u201cpolitical untouchable\u201d has largely been advanced by attacking supporters of Palestine as being antisemitic. In doing so, they not only disregard the outpouring of Jewish activists nationwide advocating for a ceasefire but also dangerously intertwine the fate of the Jewish diaspora with the Israeli government\u2019s war crimes\u2014thus fueling actual antisemitism.\nThe largest and most influential human rights organizations in the world\u2014including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch\u2014have described Israel as an apartheid state. South Africa brought Israel up on charges of genocide at the International Court of Justice, arguing that Israel has been \u201cintentionally directing attacks against the civilian population, civilian objects and buildings dedicated to religion, education, art, science, historic monuments, hospitals, and places where the sick and wounded are collected; torture; the starvation of civilians as a method of warfare; and other war crimes and crimes against humanity.\u201d\nThe International Court of Justice then issued a preliminary ruling finding the claim \u201cplausible\u201d and issued an order to Israel requiring them to take all measures within their power to prevent acts of genocide and to allow basic humanitarian services into Gaza. United Nations secretary-general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres described Israel\u2019s relentless bombing of Gaza as turning it into a \u201cgraveyard for children.\u201d\nJewish Voice for Peace issued a statement saying, \u201cThe Israeli government has declared a genocidal war on the people of Gaza. . . . This war is a continuation of the Nakba, when in 1948, tens of thousands of Palestinians fleeing violence sought refuge in Gaza. It\u2019s a continuation of 75 years of Israeli occupation and apartheid.\u201d\nOn November 7, a group of Palestinian children held a press conference outside the al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, pleading for the world to intervene to stop Israel\u2019s relentless bombing campaign. \u201cSince October 7, we\u2019ve faced extermination, killing, bombing over our heads\u2014all of this in front of the world,\u201d one young spokesperson for the group implored in English. \u201cThey lied to the world that they kill the fighters, but they kill the people of Gaza, their dreams and their future. Kids of Gaza run out of their hopes and wants.\u201d\nThe children of Gaza are asking the world to stop lying. Honest educators believe that those who oppose Israeli repression and genocide\u2014a movement made up of hundreds of millions of people all over the world\u2014 should not be censored in the classroom and that students have a right to learn about the movement for a free Palestine. \u201cYoung people are now watching genocide live streamed on social media as we speak, thousands more children are starved, injured, and murdered with weapons purchased with our United States tax dollars,\u201d the children\u2019s book author of Our Skin, Megan Madison, told me when I asked her about why it was important to resist truthcrime laws. \u201cThey don\u2019t just want to ban books. They want to hurt trans kids. They want to silence Black progressive leadership, and they are preying on the trauma of Jewish people . . .\u201d As challenging as it can be to teach truth about Palestine in the current period, as Rethinking Schools editorialized, \u201cWe should understand and take hope in the reason this backlash has grown in intensity: More people than ever are refusing to stay quiet in the face of racism and injustice.\u201d\nKeep the press free.

We get an update on ongoing ceasefire negotiations between Hamas and Israel from former Israeli peace negotiator Daniel Levy. The latest proposal, mediated by U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, \u201cwalks back the commitment for a permanent ceasefire, Israeli withdrawal and allowing in of humanitarian aid.\u201d It\u2019s a bad deal for the Palestinians that will allow Israel to continue its ethnic cleansing of Gaza, says Levy. Meanwhile, families of Israeli hostages are protesting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s delays in securing a deal as he works toward \u201cpermanent war\u201d and the eventual annexation of Gaza. \u201cNone of this would be possible if so much of the Israeli media and society was not mobilized in support of this, and none of that would be possible if Israel wasn\u2019t treated with impunity.\u201d Levy also responds to the latest massacre of Palestinians at an aid site operated by the U.S.-Israeli aid initiative, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.\nTRANSCRIPT\nThis is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.\nAMY GOODMAN: We begin today\u2019s show with Gaza ceasefire talks, which are underway after Israeli military tanks opened fire Sunday and killed at least 30 Palestinians near Rafah in southern Gaza as they were waiting for aid. More than 170 others were wounded. Israel has denied responsibility. The aid site is operated by the U.S.-Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. This is a witness named Ibrahim Abu Saud, who described the attack to Al Jazeera.\nIBRAHIM ABU SAUD: [translated] They said there was aid, and we were supposed to enter at 5:30. We were advancing toward the Al-Alam roundabout near the sea, and there was a lot of gunfire. The quadcopters came and said there was no aid today. At 6:00, the tanks were firing, but no one was doing anything to the Israelis.\nAMY GOODMAN: Soon we\u2019ll go to Gaza to talk more about the attack with a doctor who treated survivors and with a local NGO coordinator, but first we get an update on how negotiations are continuing over a possible ceasefire.\nOver the weekend, Hamas submitted its response to a proposal by U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. Hamas is offering to release 10 living hostages and 18 bodies in return for Israel\u2019s release of Palestinian prisoners. Hamas is also seeking a complete end to Israel\u2019s war on Gaza and withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, but Witkoff has called Hamas\u2019s response \u201ctotally unacceptable.\u201d\nMeanwhile, in the United States, authorities in Boulder, Colorado, have arrested a man accused of using a makeshift flamethrower and another incendiary device to attack a crowd of people taking part in a weekly walk honoring Israeli hostages in Gaza. Eight people were injured with burns, at least one in critical condition. The FBI said the attack is being investigated as an act of terrorism.\nFor more, we\u2019re joined in London by Daniel Levy, president of the U.S./Middle East Project, a former Israeli peace negotiator under Prime Ministers Ehud Barak and Yitzhak Rabin.\nDaniel, welcome back to Democracy Now! First, if you can talk about where the ceasefire proposal stands right now?\nDANIEL LEVY: Good to be back, Amy, although the circumstances continue and worsen in terms of how dire they are.\nThat ceasefire diplomacy, first of all, let\u2019s be very clear, this doesn\u2019t have to be a partial release of the Israelis being held. That\u2019s a modality that the Israeli side has pushed for, instead of being willing to bring a total, definitive end to this, all the Israelis living and dead out, a full cessation, full withdrawal, etc. It\u2019s important to remember that the agreement reached at the very beginning of Trump\u2019s term, if people cast their minds back, Israelis being held were released. There were six weeks of a largely respected \u2014 not entirely on the Israeli side \u2014 ceasefire. That arrangement was that one would segue from a first phase into subsequent phases of releases towards a permanent ceasefire. Israel broke that ceasefire. It not only broke that ceasefire, but it launched probably the most barbaric of its assaults over the ensuing weeks, if one measures that in terms of the degree of the blockade and starvation regime imposed on Gaza. Talks resumed.\nWhere are we? The U.S. did something which should have been obvious all along, and further shame on the Biden administration that it didn\u2019t do this. It spoke directly through envoys to Hamas. Adam Boehler, the hostage envoy, and subsequently someone called Bishara Bahbah, has been in direct talks with the Hamas leadership conducting these talks. They apparently reached an arrangement. That arrangement was apparently then rewritten at Israel\u2019s assistance, put American stars and stripes on it and repackaged as an American proposal put forward by Witkoff. That seems to be Witkoff playing the regular game of America putting forward Israeli positions. That\u2019s, if you like, channeling his inner Biden or Blinken. That proposal \u2014 let\u2019s be very clear: That proposal walks back the commitment for a permanent ceasefire, Israeli withdrawal and allowing in of humanitarian aid.\nNow, given that the Israeli prime minister is basically telling us the following, that his government is telling us the following: \u201cWe can have a pause, we can get some of the Israelis back, and then we will resume our\u201d \u2014 I\u2019ll use the word \u2014 \u2018genocide.\u2019\u201d They don\u2019t quite say it, but they say everything that constitutes a genocide, that they will continue the ethnic cleansing, the squeezing of Palestinians into smaller areas in Gaza, the plans for resettlement, the killing, the destruction. By the way, they\u2019re also pursuing similar goals in the West Bank. So, Netanyahu is saying, \u201cYou give us back some, and then your people can rest. Our soldiers can rest. Our troops can rest for 60-odd days. And then we\u2019ll double down and make it even worse.\u201d That is not a deal anyone should accept. The ball is now back in Witkoff and Netanyahu\u2019s court. From what we\u2019ve seen so far, one shouldn\u2019t be hopeful. But that\u2019s where we stand, Amy.\nAMY GOODMAN: I wanted to go to what happened on Saturday in the streets of Tel Aviv, Israeli protesters demanding an immediate ceasefire and release of remaining hostages. This is Yotam Cohen, brother of hostage Nimrod Cohen.\nYOTAM COHEN: We are facing moral bankruptcy. Netanyahu is abandoning our loved ones in captivity and crushing the Israeli ethos upon which we were raised, for which, for his own political motives, we are left with no other option but to turn to the United States special envoy to the Middle East. Please, Mr. Witkoff, if the hostage deal outline is accepted, place a comprehensive deal on the table immediately, one that will end the war and ensure the return of all remaining hostages. Don\u2019t let Netanyahu torpedo this deal and resume the fighting, the fighting that will cause the living hostages their lives.\nAMY GOODMAN: That\u2019s the brother of hostage Nimrod Cohen. Also at the protest Saturday in Tel Aviv was protester Amram Zahavi.\nAMRAM ZAHAVI: And usually I want to apologize to the world to be a Jew and Israeli in a country that behaves like the Germany, the Nazis at 1940. I say that Israel is now a complete copy of what happened in Germany and the atrocity and the genocide that Israel is doing in Gaza.\nAMY GOODMAN: That\u2019s Israeli protester Amram Zahavi. If you can respond, one, to the family member of a hostage and to these Israeli protesters in the streets? And does that put pressure on Netanyahu?\nDANIEL LEVY: I wish I could tell you that it puts the requisite level of pressure on Netanyahu. So, what we have, Amy, is a situation where many of the families of the Israelis still being held, and of those who have been released already, and their supporters have taken to the streets because they have clarity on this, that the person preventing this deal \u2014 not as Witkoff tells us, Hamas, just like Blinken and Biden told us, but it\u2019s Netanyahu who\u2019s preventing a deal, because he wants a permanent war. You now have a former Israeli prime minister acknowledging what the International Criminal Court, the International Court of Justice, so much of the world has acknowledged for so many months, which is that Israel is committing war crimes. This is what former Prime Minister Olmert has said. You have 1,500-plus Israeli academics who have written to the heads of the universities, saying they must distance themselves from the war crimes that Israel is committing.\nIn the meantime, much of the Israeli official political opposition is against Netanyahu for a variety of reasons but is not calling out the crimes that are being committed, is not opposing his war. And Netanyahu sees his best political path as continuing the war, and he also sees that this is the fulfillment of the ideological vision of trying to permanently remove the Palestinians. Israel set up a directorate. I\u2019ll give you the name of it. It\u2019s the Directorate for the Voluntary Emigration of Gaza Residents, headed by a colonel, Yaakov Blitstein, inside the Defense Ministry. Now, there\u2019s nothing voluntary about trying to get rid of people when you\u2019re starving and kettling them into ever smaller areas.\nNone of this would be possible if so much of the Israeli media and society was not mobilized in support of this, and none of that would be possible, Amy, if Israel wasn\u2019t treated with impunity externally. Of course, the U.S. leads that, but beyond it, we\u2019re now hearing words. We\u2019re now hearing much more relevant rhetoric from Israel\u2019s Western allies, but we\u2019re not seeing the commensurate actions. We\u2019re not seeing Europeans, Canadians, others imposing an arms embargo, seizing Israeli foreign assets. We\u2019re not seeing Israel isolated from international sport. As long as there is impunity, these crimes will continue.\nThere are people who say, Amy, that you have this tension between America first and Israel first inside Trump world, that the kind of cultural war of Palestine-Israel fought domestically \u2014 so, what\u2019s being done with universities, with funding, with foreign students \u2014 by the way, we, of course, see the extremely courageous and very on-point messages in some of the commencement speeches. But that domestic deployment of Israel-Palestine is a little different from the geopolitical management, where the Trump administration have not gone along with Israel\u2019s position on Iran, on the continuing to strike the Houthis \u2014 they did, and then they stopped \u2014 on Syria sanctions. They visited \u2014 he visited the Gulf, but not Israel. So, there is \u2014 there is some cracks there. There are some divisions. Unfortunately, what you don\u2019t have is any acknowledgment of Palestinian humanity from this administration, but it is an administration talking to Hamas that conceivably could still put forward a ceasefire plan, but that will depend on much more pressure. That\u2019s not where they are today, and that\u2019s not the zeitgeist that we\u2019re seeing.\nAMY GOODMAN: Very quickly, because we\u2019re going to a doctor in Gaza, and you could imagine these hospitals are incredibly busy, I wanted to get your comment on Israel\u2019s denial that it was involved in the killing of at least 30 Palestinians who went to get aid, who were told by quadcopters that they can go to the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation to get aid, and then were gunned down. Israel is saying it wasn\u2019t them, the Israeli military, who did that. And also what happened in Boulder, this man, shirtless, with some kind of flamethrower, burning eight Americans who were standing in vigil for Israeli hostages?\nDANIEL LEVY: So, let me touch on that first. Of course, any attack on people exerting their right to protest, to rally anywhere, certainly including in the U.S., including in Boulder, Colorado, that\u2019s a criminal act. That person should have the full force of the law brought against them. There\u2019s no question in terms of condemning what was done there. I don\u2019t see how anyone could condemn that but think it\u2019s OK that in another part of the world a country shoots people who are desperately trying to get some aid and starves and besieges a population of 2 million-plus civilians. So, that\u2019s the Boulder situation.\nLook, in terms of the Israeli denials, we understand that approximately 75 Palestinians have been killed in the under a week that this new authority has been functioning. I call it genocide profiteering, a private company distributing aid. Israel has denied. We\u2019ve been here before, right, Amy? It\u2019s not our first rodeo. Israel immediately issues its denial, comes up with some spurious counterclaim, hopes the news cycle moves on. In the end, we find out that the denials were worth precisely nothing. One has to acknowledge that the media has been banned from there. If Israel wanted to get its story out, let the media in. And if the media took itself seriously, then it would point that out \u2014 the mainstream media, I\u2019m not talking about Democracy Now!, of course. There are citizen journalists who you can always turn to. There are people on the ground. You\u2019re about to do that. So, there\u2019s no credibility to that, to that claim.\nBut if I may, one point on this Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, so-called, there is a mechanism to get aid to the people in Gaza. It\u2019s tried and tested. It\u2019s through the U.N. and other aid delivery systems that work according to humanitarian principles. Israel\u2019s claim that Hamas has been siphoning off that aid, and that\u2019s how it stays in power, has been repeated. It\u2019s spurious. It has not been proven. What Israel is doing here by creating these zones, by making announcements on quadcopters, by sending people across great distances in Gaza, and then shooting those people, it is a layer of cruelty that tears at the very humanity of all of us, yet another layer of cruelty. And even if the Palestinians aren\u2019t what keeps you awake at night, we should be clear that what Israel is establishing here in terms of undermining the fundamentals of global principles of humanitarian assistance should matter to everyone, just as the way Israel has used AI \u2014 Lavender, they called it \u2014 robotics in such appalling ways in their strikes in Gaza, and just as genocidal actions and narratives have been normalized. We have to bring an end to it. You\u2019re about to hear the horrors of what is going on on the ground. Everyone must redouble their efforts to end this. Stop genocide, end apartheid, sanctions now.\nAMY GOODMAN: Daniel Levy, I want to thank you for being with us, president of the U.S./Middle East Project, former Israeli peace negotiator under Prime Ministers Ehud Barak and Yitzhak Rabin.\nWhen we come back, we go to Gaza to speak with a doctor who treated the wounded this weekend.

Part of the Series\nStruggle and Solidarity: Writing Toward Palestinian Liberation\nDozens of lawyers, academics, human rights advocates, and journalists from Palestine, Israel, and global civil society issued a call to conscience on May 29 from a gathering in the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Dubbed the Sarajevo Declaration, the 2,000-word document was the culmination of the three-day preliminary hearing of the Gaza Tribunal, a newly formed people\u2019s justice initiative aiming to voice \u201ccollective moral outrage\u201d over what it described as Israel\u2019s genocide of Palestinians and the decades of impunity for atrocities leading to it.\nThroughout three eight-hour days, the tribunal heard 45 back-to-back testimonies of research and analysis on the conditions of life and death in Gaza and across the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territories. The entries \u2014 about obliteration of cultural heritage, violations of reproductive and disability rights, the weaponization of accusations of antisemitism, capital accumulation on Gaza\u2019s rubble and in the West Bank, and otherwise \u2014 made a case beyond the charge of genocide, which members of the tribunal and a growing proportion of the global human rights community view as fact. Unbound by formal procedure and jurisdiction, tribunal members also brought in analysis of the context predating October 7, 2023. All together, they built an argument that the present stage of genocide in Palestine is the logical end point of a Zionism\u2019s project of domination initiated before 1948 \u2014 and that the exceptions that have allowed it have also undermined international law, global cooperation and the United Nations system for all.\nIsrael and those enabling its actions \u201cwant Gaza to be the graveyard of international law,\u201d said Raji Sourani, a Palestinian attorney from Gaza and founder and director of the Palestinian Center for Human Rights in Gaza City, in his address at the close of the tribunal\u2019s first day. \u201cNot for Gazans, not for Palestinians, but for the whole world.\u201d\nThe semi-closed session on the hushed campus of the International University of Sarajevo was the Gaza Tribunal\u2019s first meeting, with the final verdict planned for a last session in October. The proceedings \u2014 in their quasi-academic format of panels, PowerPoints, and papers \u2014 were both desperate in their desire to impede atrocities and self-conscious of the impossibility to meet the present horror: Israel\u2019s military has intensified its aerial bombardment and blockade of Gaza, in addition to opening fire on people queued for food, leading to some of the deadliest days since Israel broke the last ceasefire in March.\nAs Israel advances its campaign against Palestinians, the tribunal is among a wave of recent mobilizations attempting to intervene outside of traditional judicial, diplomatic, and humanitarian spaces. For example, the Freedom Flotilla, a civilian ship stocked with aid, was sailing through international waters in the Mediterranean Sea toward Gaza\u2019s coastline when it was intercepted by Israeli forces, and the activists onboard were detained on June 9. That day, a group of organizations and activists began the Global March to Gaza from Tunisia, hoping to cross through North Africa to the Rafah border and negotiate entrance into the besieged Strip.\nThe Gaza Tribunal\u2019s intended intervention is less direct. The initiative channels a tradition dating back to the Vietnam War, during which intellectuals and activists created the Russell Tribunal on U.S. War Crimes. Since then, people\u2019s tribunals have convened civil society dozens of times to expose and protest atrocities against communities that the law has failed to protect or rendered expendable. Despite their name, these tribunals have no legal authority; they shed the trappings of the courtroom and presume the accused \u2013 powerful states \u2013 guilty. Organizers hope that this most recent iteration will process the overwhelming evidence from Gaza into a comprehensive historical record that can provide support to other efforts on narrative, political, and legal battlegrounds.\nRichard Falk, president of the Gaza Tribunal, is a professor of law and former UN official on the Occupied Palestinian Territories who attended the first Russell Tribunal in 1967, and has since participated in and led numerous others. \u201cThe people\u2019s tribunal seeks action \u2026 ranging from pressure on governments to cease supplying weapons and funds and on other parts of society to impose solidarity initiatives,\u201d including Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions, Falk said in an interview prior to the tribunal\u2019s meeting in Sarajevo.\nExceptions Are the Rule of Law for Palestine\nBy the time the international law chamber launched the first day of the Gaza Tribunal, the fact of genocide was plain, organizers said: Consensus had already developed among independent mechanisms of the United Nations, academics, experts, and human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch that Israel is violating the 1948 Genocide Convention; there was no denying 19 months of overwhelming, livestreamed evidence, they said.\nStill, the chamber built its case, testimony laying the framework for analysis of genocide under international law followed by research and witness accounts of genocidal acts. Palestinian journalist Ahmed Abu Artema, in a pre-recorded audio entry from Gaza, described the hell of relentless forced evacuations as Israeli military demarcate neighborhoods for strikes. Thaer Ahmad and Mimi Syed, both physician volunteers who traveled to Gaza from the United States, spoke from the podium about providing medical care amid endless mass casualty incidents, medical supply shortages, and contaminated conditions. First-year university student Senad Bibanovich said their remarks were so appalling he felt ill simply from listening.\nThe Gaza Tribunal was therefore not charging Israel alone with genocide, which South Africa has already done before the International Court of Justice in a case now 17 months underway, in which the court has found it plausible that Israel is violating the Genocide Convention and ordered it in January 2024 to take measures to protect against further abuses in Gaza. Rather, the tribunal intended to spotlight how other states and the inadequacy of the international system have made genocide against Palestinians in Gaza possible.\n\u201cThere is a clear problem in current mechanisms of prevention and accountability \u2026 because they have allowed for 19 months now these kind of crimes in plain sight to be committed,\u201d said Nimer Sultany, international law scholar at SOAS University of London, author and member of the international law chamber, in an interview between sessions.\nThe task of the Gaza Tribunal is therefore \u201cnot related only to Gaza and Palestine exclusively; it\u2019s also about why \u2018Never Again\u2019 did not work,\u201d Sultany continued.\nThe diagnosis came with the next chambers, which dealt with the comparative, geopolitical, and historical dimensions of this and other genocides.\nExplaining the abject failure of \u201cNever Again\u201d requires revisiting the beginning of the post-World War II international system, Craig Mokhiber, former director of the New York office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, submitted in a virtual testimony on the tribunal\u2019s second day. In 1948, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Genocide Convention both came on the heels of the 1947 UN Partition Plan for Palestine. The first two created universal norms of self-determination and freedom from genocide; the other, Mokhiber said, ratified belligerent land theft and ethnic cleansing of the Nakba, the mass displacement of approximately 750,000 Palestinians from their homes between 1947 and 1949.\nThis confounded moment birthed what Mokhiber called \u201cthe Israel exception to international law \u2026 that has haunted [the UN] for decades, carved out space for genocide and ultimately threatened the very legitimacy and sustainability of the United Nations itself.\u201d\n\u201cSelectivity and politicization of international law \u2014 that is the rule,\u201d Palestinian human rights attorney Sourani said in his address.\nMokhiber said that the Israel exception is a symptom of what he called \u201cthe fundamental contradiction in international law: There are in fact two UNs.\u201d\nAccording to Mokhiber, the first UN is the one with deference to its own charter and human rights treaties; where colonization, apartheid, and genocide are universally prohibited. The second UN is the one that partitioned Palestine; that, during the three-decade Oslo Accords between the Palestinian Liberation Organization and Israel, \u201ctold the Palestinians they must negotiate for their rights with their oppressor\u201d in a process mediated by the United States, \u201cthe world\u2019s sole superpower, which also happened to be Israel\u2019s closest ally and arms provider\u201d; the UN that has been \u201csilent on genocide, unable to call for ceasefire or accountability.\u201d\nWhat makes the latter more often the UN in force is the fact that there is no formal method outside the Security Council of enforcing human rights instruments, UN General Assembly resolutions, or International Court of Justice orders \u2014 such as its January 2024 provisional measures or its July 2024 opinion finding Israel\u2019s occupation illegal, and requiring that other states not \u201crender aid or assistance\u201d toward maintaining occupation in the Palestinian Territories (a conclusion the United States has criticized as too broad). The Security Council enjoys a range of authorities, including imposing sanctions and military action; but its five permanent state parties \u2014 China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States \u2014 have unchecked veto power on any council decision.\n\u201cWhat then can the UN, its member states and all who support its founding principles do to end a genocide, protect its victims and hold its perpetrators to account when a veto-wielding permanent member of the Security Council is itself implicated in the perpetration of a genocide and fully committed to its continuation?\u201d Mokhiber asked.\nOn June 4, the United States vetoed a ceasefire resolution in the Security Council, bringing its total number of vetoes with respect to Palestine since October 2023 to six; since 1945, at least, the U.S. has vetoed at least 40.\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Intervention\nThese exceptions and failures, and the disconnect between unprecedented popular solidarity with Palestinians and the continued diplomatic and military support by governments of Israel, demanded a tribunal come together, organizers said.\nThe tribunal form is \u201creally key\u201d for civil society to do what states and international institutions are not: \u201ctaking to task the governments who are complicit in these crimes, not relying on the incredibly slow process of the international legal order,\u201d said Penny Green, a professor of law at Queen Mary University of London School of Law, and member of the steering committee who has participated in other tribunals past. \u201cThe wheels of international law turn so slowly, and then they are toothless.\u201d\nYet, some have questioned what the tribunal can accomplish when the world has already been saturated daily by the evidence of the horror in Gaza and has still not been able to end an active genocide. Gianni Tognoni, the secretary general of the Permanent Peoples\u2019 Tribunal, the institutional home for over 50 people\u2019s tribunals worldwide, was in attendance. He pointed out in a conversation between panels this dilemma: In other cases, tribunals have served to give visibility to an injustice that has been ignored or covered up. \u201cHere, the opposite: we have visibility in excess,\u201d he said.\nThough the tribunal doesn\u2019t have legal or enforcement power, members anticipated it could serve as a source of mass, credible documentation for others to draw on in organizing political pressure on complicit actors and in future legal efforts toward accountability. Organizers said they are collecting all the material, including members\u2019 oral testimony and reports into a single archive, from the session in Sarajevo and the second in October.\n\u201cThis entire tribunal is really a complement to the efforts of Palestinian civil society as a whole that has been ongoing throughout this genocide in particular but for decades,\u201d according to Wesam Ahmad, a human rights advocate at the Palestinian NGO Al-Haq and tribunal steering committee member. His hope is that the repository of the tribunal material could be marshaled in organizing on the ground.\nHow the tribunal specifically plans to support Palestinian and solidarity organizing was not made explicit; but one possible contribution it might make is to future criminal cases and lawsuits against Israel and other actors in formal courts, said Susan Akram, member of the tribunal\u2019s steering committee and co-chair of the international law chamber.\nEven the act of gathering together and naming the crimes can be significant if it\u2019s brought back to people in Gaza, said Akram Lilja, a professor from Gaza and project lead on damage assessment of cultural heritage sites in Gaza, which includes 30 people on the ground. He can now tell his team in Gaza that there are people from Bosnia, New York, California, Turkey, \u201cfrom every place around the world who know about you\u2026. You are not alone.\u201d\nTo some, the potential of people\u2019s tribunals comes from their ability to source their principles outside international law, with its deep contradictions and inequities, and to act with immediacy, creativity, and moral clarity. Limited thus far to symbolic proclamations and with the Gaza Tribunal\u2019s final judgment not expected until October, it remains to be seen what doing so will look like.\nIn his short address to the membership the day before the Sarajevo Declaration was ratified, Tognoni, the secretary general of the Permanent Peoples\u2019 Tribunal, spoke plainly: The evidence of Israel and the world\u2019s crimes \u201cis so beyond a reasonable doubt it cannot be considered a juridical problem.\u201d\nThe time has come, he asserted, to \u201cstop talking about violations.\u201d Those alive in Gaza \u201cdo not have the time to die and die and die\u201d because of delays in \u201cjuridical qualification.\u201d\nTognoni requested that the tribunal \u201chave a judgment in real time while [Palestinians] are living and looking to the future. That is the main right of the Palestinian people, to have a future now.\u201d\nKeep the press free. Fight political repression.\nTruthout urgently appeals for your support.

We look forward to putting our commitments into action to make American steelmaking and manufacturing great again.\u201d\nThe companies have completed a U.S. Department of Justice review and received all necessary regulatory approvals, the statement said.\n\u201cThe partnership is expected to be finalized promptly,\u201d the statement said.\nU.S. Steel rose $2.66, or 5%, to $54.85 in afterhours trading Friday. Nippon Steel's original bid to buy the Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel in late 2023 had been valued at $55 per share.\nThe companies offered few details on how the golden share would work, what other provisions are in the national security agreement and how specifically the $11 billion would be spent.\nWhite House spokesman Kush Desai said the order \u201censures U.S. Steel will remain in the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and be safeguarded as a critical element of America\u2019s national and economic security.\u201d\nJames Brower, a Morrison Foerster lawyer who represents clients in national security-related matters, said such agreements with the government typically are not disclosed to the public, particularly by the government.\nThey can become public, but it's almost always disclosed by a party in the transaction, such as a company \u2014 like U.S. Steel \u2014 that is publicly held, Brower said.\nThe mechanics of how a golden share would work will depend on the national security agreement, but in such agreements it isn't unusual to give the government approval rights over specific activities, Brower said.\nU.S. Steel made no filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday.\nNippon Steel originally offered nearly $15 billion to purchase U.S. Steel in an acquisition that had been delayed on national security concerns starting during Joe Biden\u2019s presidency.\nAs it sought to win over American officials, Nippon Steel gradually increased the amount of money it was pledging to invest into U.S. Steel. American officials now value the transaction at $28 billion, including the purchase bid and a new electric arc furnace \u2014 a more modern steel mill that melts down scrap \u2014 that they say Nippon Steel will build in the U.S. after 2028.\nNippon Steel had pledged to maintain U.S. Steel\u2019s headquarters in Pittsburgh, put U.S. Steel under a board with a majority of American citizens and keep plants operating.\nIt also said it would protect the interests of U.S. Steel in trade matters and it wouldn\u2019t import steel slabs that would compete with U.S. Steel\u2019s blast furnaces in Pennsylvania and Indiana.\nTrump opposed the purchase while campaigning for the White House, and using his authority Biden blocked the transaction on his way out of the White House. But Trump expressed openness to working out an arrangement once he returned to the White House in January.\nTrump said Thursday that he would as president have \u201ctotal control\u201d of what U.S. Steel did as part of the investment.\nTrump said then that the deal would preserve \u201c51% ownership by Americans,\u201d although Nippon Steel has never backed off its stated intention of buying and controlling U.S. Steel as a wholly owned subsidiary.\n\u201cWe have a golden share, which I control,\u201d Trump said.\nTrump added that he was \u201ca little concerned\u201d about what presidents other than him would do with their golden share, \u201cbut that gives you total control.\u201d\nThe proposed merger had been under review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, during the Trump and Biden administrations.\nThe order signed Friday by Trump said the CFIUS review provided \u201ccredible evidence\u201d that Nippon Steel \u201cmight take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States,\u201d but such risks might be \u201cadequately mitigated\u201d by approving the proposed national security agreement.\nThe order doesn't detail the perceived national security risk and only provides a timeline for the national security agreement. The White House declined to provide details on the terms of the agreement.\nThe order said the draft agreement was submitted to U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel on Friday.

A new JAMA Network Open paper adds to a body of evidence that not all systematic reviews are created equal and some researchers are trying out alternatives to these analyses.\nSystematic reviews, which involve pooling data from multiple studies and analyzing them together, are increasingly popular as a way to produce more authoritative conclusions than can be derived from the individual smaller papers. A small number of systematic reviews included retracted studies from paper mills, journals that produce low quality research to help researchers game the academic job market.\nThe problems are not limited to academia, either. In recent weeks, systematic reviews have been used to justify policy around gender affirming care as well as in the MAHA report.

Instituting these work requirements would only actually affect a tiny fraction of the 4.8 to 6 million adults projected to lose coverage under the policy. This analysis is the latest report to demonstrate that Medicaid cuts could affect more Americans than Republicans suggest.\nWork requirements are important for Republicans who wish to reduce federal spending.

Studies show that committee members with industry relationships tend to publish more and higher-impact articles, suggesting they can bring more expertise to the table.

How Trump\u2019s last-minute contract decision sent brains to the grave\nBrain banks stopped taking donations as their contract expiration date approached.\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s push to cut billions of dollars in government contracts is rattling the niche community of scientists who collect, study and share human brains.\nTwo of the country\u2019s brain banks, which have worked with the government to store and distribute specimens to researchers studying diseases like Parkinson\u2019s and ALS for more than a decade, told POLITICO they had temporarily stopped taking new donations for fear the administration would not renew their contracts. Even though both facilities \u2014 home to nearly 8,000 brains between them \u2014 eventually received six-month extensions from the National Institutes of Health, the relief came too close to a May 1 deadline.\nThe director of the University of Maryland Brain and Tissue Bank said it turned away as many as 30 brains from people hoping to do something positive with the remains of a loved one who lived with a neurological disease. The Mount Sinai Brain Bank in New York would have accepted roughly 10 more if it had known its contract was being renewed, according to its program director.\nThe funding whiplash demonstrates some of the practical consequences of the Trump administration\u2019s rapid-fire approach to cutting federal spending, where even the potential for funding lapses create real setbacks.\n\u201cNot knowing when, or even if this extension was going to happen, it was very problematic,\u201d said Tom Blanchard, director of Maryland\u2019s brain bank. The window for collecting a brain for research after death is short: just 24 hours, so families of would-be donors had little choice but to give up.\nUnsure whether it\u2019d be able to pay staff after April, Mount Sinai Brain Bank sent layoff notices to its nearly two dozen employees, then revoked them when it learned of the funding extension less than 18 hours before the deadline, said program director Harry Haroutunian.\nIn the month before the contract expiration, the program, which stores 2,640 brains in 43 freezers set at minus 80 degrees Celsius, stopped taking them. Mount Sinai typically takes two brain donations a week.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t about to accept a donation and then not be in a position to actually characterize the brain and distribute it to our investigators,\u201d Haroutunian said.\nWhen asked to respond to researcher concerns about funding uncertainty, a spokesperson at the Department of Health and Human Services said that leaders at HHS, the parent agency of the National Institutes of Health, maintain continuous communication with NIH leadership to ensure smooth funding. The spokesperson said NIH remains committed to \u201crigorous, Gold Standard Science.\u201d\nFrustrated donors\nSusan Mojaverian felt heartened by the idea of donating her brother James\u2019 brain to the NIH. She\u2019d discussed the plan with him prior to his death last month. James, who died at 72, was diagnosed with schizophrenia when he was 16.\nFurthering research into schizophrenia was important to them. Susan and James participated in an NIH schizophrenia sibling study where they traveled to the agency\u2019s Bethesda, Maryland, campus for days of psychological tests and MRIs.\nResearch on donor brains has helped scientists understand the genetic risk for schizophrenia, shown distinct scarring patterns on the brains of servicemembers who suffered blast injuries and helped identify cells that contribute to developing Down syndrome.\nThrough the NIH\u2019s NeuroBioBank, researchers around the world can search an inventory of thousands of brains across the six repositories, refine their search by diagnosis, age, race, gender and brain region, then order brain tissue by volume, weight or number of brain sections. The NIH manages researcher requests, while the repositories collect and prepare the donor brains, fulfill orders and mail out tissue. All scientists pay is shipping.\nWithout the NIH program, brain donor research would be prohibitively expensive, said Blanchard. A single piece of brain tissue could cost $250 through a commercial lab, he explained, and researchers need to purchase enough samples to produce statistically significant results \u2014 plus buy control group samples. Without the federally funded network saving them millions of dollars a year, researching human tissue might be too expensive for some scientists.\nThe loss of the brains at Maryland and Mount Sinai could have consequences for research, he added, pointing to the brains of Parkinson\u2019s patients: \u201cEverybody wants to study the same small region of the brain, the substantia nigra,\u201d Blanchard said, adding, \u201cEven though we have the whole brain, for the Parkinson\u2019s research community, they get exhausted quickly.\u201d\nWhen Mojaverian contacted the director of the NIH\u2019s Human Brain Collection Core by email, he offered his condolences and the Maryland brain bank\u2019s phone number. He added a note in his reply, stressing the importance of James\u2019 donation. \u201cFor UMD: the decedent was extensively studied at NIH as a participant with schizophrenia. It would be important to acquire this brain if at all possible.\u201d\nLater that day, Mojaverian approached Maryland about making the donation, and was told it wouldn\u2019t be possible.\nMaryland\u2019s donor portal was clear about the reason why: \u201cDue to the uncertainty of federal funds UMBTB is anticipating a funding gap, that will impact our ability to collect donations. We cannot anticipate how long this funding gap will be.\u201d\nBy the time Maryland learned of its contract extension 16 days later, the window to accept James\u2019 brain had passed.\nMojaverian, who said she\u2019s had a good experience with NIH researchers and doctors over the decades, blamed the Trump administration for her loss.\n\u201cThis is the contribution that my brother, who had so much potential in this world and was never able to achieve it because of this severe and persistent mental illness \u2014 that he could be making this major contribution to science and somebody else would benefit from it,\u201d she said.\nMembers of Congress, including Republicans, have also complained about the administration\u2019s approach to cost-cutting.\n\u201cStability is a key aspect of the American formula because it allows scientists to focus their work knowing that they will have the support they need to pursue and test their ideas from start to finish,\u201d Senate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins (R-Maine) said during an Appropriations Committee hearing last month.\nVice Chair Patty Murray (D-Wash.) put it more directly. \u201cTrump is committing deliberate sabotage at NIH and creating indefensible uncertainty that is making it impossible for researchers to do their jobs,\u201d Murray told POLITICO.\nA broader problem\nThe ambiguity and eleventh-hour funding decisions at the brain banks are indicative of a larger phenomenon the NIH-funded research ecosystem is grappling with as Trump reconsiders its work.\nAnother program that suffered funding whiplash was the Women\u2019s Health Initiative, an ongoing long-term national women\u2019s health study backed by an NIH institute.\nOn April 21, initiative investigators reported that HHS was terminating the program\u2019s regional center contracts. A few days later, following widespread news coverage, an HHS spokesperson told POLITICO the funding was being restored. It wasn\u2019t until May 5 that contractors received official confirmation.\nWithout timely communication, investigators were left to wonder whether HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s public comments calling the centers\u2019 work \u201cmission critical for women\u2019s health\u201d and the cuts \u201cfake news\u201d meant that HHS would maintain current funding levels, impose some funding reductions or whether nothing had changed and the cuts were still coming.\nHHS said that government procedures and bureaucratic processes held up officially notifying the group of restored funding.\nWhile renewing and restoring research funding have run up against the red tape of government processes and procedures, cuts have come more swiftly, with few signs that bureaucracy is holding them up.\nRegardless of the cause of the notification delay, the uncertainty had a chilling effect. Investigators, especially early career researchers, were reluctant to pitch new projects to the Women\u2019s Health Initiative. Staff worried about losing their jobs. Managers wondered how they\u2019d quickly wind down the 32-year-old project, notify the 42,000 participants and destroy or negotiate transfer of 4 million vials of frozen biospecimens.\nMeanwhile, the administration\u2019s decision to extend the brain bank contracts for six months doesn\u2019t end the banks\u2019 uncertainty. While Blanchard said he\u2019s optimistic in the wake of the renewal, if a month or two passes without word of the next review or funding meeting, his anxiety will return. While the October contract renewal should be for five years, he\u2019s concerned that his funding level could be cut, likely causing him to reduce donations once again or cut staff.\nNIH program officers told Mount Sinai\u2019s Haroutunian that maintaining the program\u2019s resources is an agency priority and that they expect to be able to renew the funding in October, he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s guesswork on everybody\u2019s part,\u201d he added."]}, {"topic": 44, "name": "Trump Mobile Launch", "keywords": "mobile, trump, phone, verizon, service, company, unlimited, card, smartphone, tmobile", "documents": ["Trump family announces another venture, a mobile phone company.

Organizers of the \u201cNo Kings\u201d demonstrations said millions had marched in hundreds of events. Governors across the U.S. had urged calm and vowed no tolerance for violence, while some mobilized the National Guard ahead of marchers gathering. WATCH: Millions turn out nationwide for \u2018No Kings\u2019 protests against Trump administration Confrontations were isolated. But police in Los Angeles, where protests over federal immigration enforcement raids erupted a week earlier and sparked demonstrations across the country, used tear gas and crowd-control munitions to clear out protesters after the formal event ended. A previously calm demonstration in downtown LA quickly turned chaotic as police on horseback charged at the crowd, striking some with wood rods and batons as they cleared the street in front of the federal building.

Some have since regrouped, ignoring an LAPD dispersal order. \u201cIt was a total 100% overreaction. We weren\u2019t doing anything but standing around chanting peaceful protest,\u201d said Samantha Edgerton, a 37-year-old bartender. Huge, boisterous crowds marched, danced, drummed, and chanted shoulder-to-shoulder in New York, Denver, Chicago, Austin and Los Angeles, some behind \u201cno kings\u201d banners. Atlanta\u2019s 5,000-capacity event quickly reached its limit, with thousands more gathered outside barriers to hear speakers in front of the state Capitol. Trump was in Washington for a military parade marking the Army\u2019s 250th anniversary that coincides with the president\u2019s birthday.

Mexican flags, which have become a fixture of the Los Angeles protests against immigration raids, also made an appearance at some demonstrations Saturday. In Culpepper, Virginia, police said one person was struck by an SUV when a 21-year-old driver intentionally accelerated his SUV into the crowd as protesters were leaving a rally. The driver was charged with reckless driving. The demonstrations come on the heels of the protests over the federal immigration enforcement raids that began last week and Trump ordering the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles, where protesters blocked a freeway and set cars on fire. \u201cToday, across red states and blue, rural towns and major cities, Americans stood in peaceful unity and made it clear: we don\u2019t do kings,\u201d the No Kings Coalition said in a statement Saturday afternoon after many events had ended. \u201cSo what do you say, Philly?\u201d Democratic U.S. Rep.

Give Now By \u2014 Marc Levy, Associated Press Marc Levy, Associated Press By \u2014 Claudia Lauer, Associated Press Claudia Lauer, Associated Press By \u2014 Jim Vertuno, Associated Press Jim Vertuno, Associated Press\nPHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 Masses of demonstrators packed into streets, parks and plazas across the U.S. on Saturday to protest President Donald Trump, marching through downtowns and small towns, blaring anti-authoritarian chants mixed with support for protecting democracy and immigrant rights. Organizers of the \u201cNo Kings\u201d demonstrations said millions had marched in hundreds of events. Governors across the U.S. had urged calm and vowed no tolerance for violence, while some mobilized the National Guard ahead of marchers gathering. WATCH: Millions turn out nationwide for \u2018No Kings\u2019 protests against Trump administration Confrontations were isolated. But police in Los Angeles, where protests over federal immigration enforcement raids erupted a week earlier and sparked demonstrations across the country, used tear gas and crowd-control munitions to clear out protesters after the formal event ended. A previously calm demonstration in downtown LA quickly turned chaotic as police on horseback charged at the crowd, striking some with wood rods and batons as they cleared the street in front of the federal building.

Some have since regrouped, ignoring an LAPD dispersal order. \u201cIt was a total 100% overreaction. We weren\u2019t doing anything but standing around chanting peaceful protest,\u201d said Samantha Edgerton, a 37-year-old bartender. Huge, boisterous crowds marched, danced, drummed, and chanted shoulder-to-shoulder in New York, Denver, Chicago, Austin and Los Angeles, some behind \u201cno kings\u201d banners. Atlanta\u2019s 5,000-capacity event quickly reached its limit, with thousands more gathered outside barriers to hear speakers in front of the state Capitol. Trump was in Washington for a military parade marking the Army\u2019s 250th anniversary that coincides with the president\u2019s birthday. About 200 protesters assembled in northwest Washington\u2019s Logan Circle and chanted \u201cTrump must go now\u201d before erupting in cheers. A larger-than-life puppet of Trump \u2014 a caricature of the president wearing a crown and sitting on a golden toilet \u2014 was wheeled through the crowd.

Mexican flags, which have become a fixture of the Los Angeles protests against immigration raids, also made an appearance at some demonstrations Saturday. In Culpepper, Virginia, police said one person was struck by an SUV when a 21-year-old driver intentionally accelerated his SUV into the crowd as protesters were leaving a rally. The driver was charged with reckless driving. The demonstrations come on the heels of the protests over the federal immigration enforcement raids that began last week and Trump ordering the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles, where protesters blocked a freeway and set cars on fire. \u201cToday, across red states and blue, rural towns and major cities, Americans stood in peaceful unity and made it clear: we don\u2019t do kings,\u201d the No Kings Coalition said in a statement Saturday afternoon after many events had ended. \u201cSo what do you say, Philly?\u201d Democratic U.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland shouted to the crowd. \u201cAre you ready to fight back? Do you want a gangster state or do you want free speech in America?\u201d People participate in the \u201cNo Kings\u201d protest against President Donald Trump\u2019s policies in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, June 14, 2025.

In Los Angeles, thousands gathered in front of City Hall, hundreds gathered on the lawn in front of Mississippi\u2019s state Capitol and marchers in downtown Little Rock walked across a bridge over the Arkansas River. Protests were planned in nearly 2,000 locations across the country, from city blocks and small towns to courthouse steps and community parks, organizers said, but no events are scheduled in Washington, D.C., where the military parade will take place in the evening.

The 50501 Movement orchestrating the protests says it picked the \u201cNo Kings\u201d name to support democracy and speak out against what they call the authoritarian actions of the Trump administration. The name 50501 stands for 50 states, 50 protests, one movement. The demonstrations come on the heels of protests that flared up across the country over federal immigration enforcement raids that began last week and Trump ordering the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles, where protesters blocked a freeway and set cars on fire. Philadelphia Thousands gathered downtown, where organizers handed out small American flags and people carried protest signs saying \u201cfight oligarchy\u201d and \u201cdeport the mini-Mussolinis.\u201d Karen Van Trieste, a 61-year-old nurse who drove up from Maryland, said she grew up in Philadelphia and wanted to be with a large group of people showing her support. \u201cI just feel like we need to defend our democracy,\u201d she said. She is concerned about the Trump administration\u2019s layoffs of staff at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the fate of immigrant communities and Trump trying to rule by executive order, she said.

Trump is set to watch the spectacle from a viewing stand south of the White House.\nBut in Washington and in all 50 states, organizers will be staging protests that could dwarf the parade in size.

It\u2019s all women. We\u2019ve had families who are worried about bringing their kids to school when this all started. We\u2019ll see what it\u2019s like when the school year starts again. I\u2019ve had kids who have had a lot of anxiety about the rights for trans kids being taken away.\u201d\nWhat does she tell them?\n\u201cWe just have to have hope and to fight,\u201d she said.\nIn Colorado, Emily Baxter, a 23-year-old Boulder resident, said she also joined the Denver protest to object to the Trump administration\u2019s extreme immigration enforcement actions.\n\u201cI am very, very mad about all of the people being taken off of the street and those who are going to work and not coming home and the children who are losing their parents and losing their livelihood,\u201d Baxter said.\nThe protest comes after multiple demonstrations in Denver against deportation efforts by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, including a march to an ICE detention center in Aurora on Monday and a large gathering at the Capitol on Tuesday evening. Law enforcement deployed smoke and pepper balls against a group of protesters that marched near the interchange of Broadway and Interstate 25 on Tuesday and made 18 arrests related to the demonstration.\nThousands rallied peacefully in downtown Anchorage, Alaska, along with at least 18 communities across the state. Community advocates gave speeches calling to protect democracy, equal rights and due process, followed by a march a few blocks to the Park Strip where a Juneteenth celebration was kicking off.\nTessa Gonzalez, a pediatrician, attended the demonstration of thousands at the Statehouse grounds in Columbia, South Carolina.

Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure.\nGovernment home loans are instrumental in making homeownership affordable for Americans. By encouraging mortgage lenders to broaden service to households of modest means, more first-time home buyers can get into a house, make necessary repairs, and refinance when the time is right.\nHowever, there can be downsides to government loans too.\nHere is a comprehensive digest of the types of government home loans \u2014 and what you need to know.\nDig deeper: Types of mortgage loans\nIn this article:\nWhat are government home loans?\nGovernment home loans are insured by the federal government. That financial backing encourages lenders to extend loans to borrowers who might not otherwise qualify for a mortgage.\nGovernment-backed mortgages typically have more relaxed credit standards than conventional loans and are intended to assist first-time, low- to moderate-income, military-related, and rural home buyers.\nPrivate lenders make government loans that generally follow the credit criteria required for each type of loan. However, in some instances, they can add additional qualifying standards, such as a minimum credit score.\nNot to confuse the matter, but in reality, most home loans have some kind of government connection. Even conventional loans are facilitated by government-authorized companies (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) that provide financial resources to support mortgage markets. Only mortgages issued for higher-priced homes, called jumbo loans, usually have no government backing and are issued from lenders' own assets.\nTypes of government home loans\nGovernment home loans generally fall into three categories:\n-\nFHA mortgages\n-\nVA loans\n-\nUSDA loans\nHowever, the variations run deep for all the different types of borrowers and situations served by government home loan programs.\nFHA loans\nMortgages backed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) are called FHA loans. They generally offer down payments as low as 3.5% but are saddled with mortgage insurance premiums.\nLearn more: Understanding FHA mortgage insurance\nFHA home purchase 203(b) loan\nThe 203(b) loan is the primary purchase and refinance lending tool and the foundation of the FHA mortgage program. It\u2019s probably what you think of when you hear the term \u201cFHA loan.\u201d It can finance a single-family home or units of up to four units.\nFHA adjustable-rate mortgage\nWhile FHA loans usually have fixed interest rates that never change, they can also be adjustable-rate mortgages. Your loan begins with an initial interest rate and then periodically changes \u2014 up or down \u2014 based on an interest rate index. It can be a useful loan option to consider when interest rates are expected to move lower over time.\nFHA condominium mortgage\nCondo lending is also available through an FHA-backed mortgage. Thing is, the condo has to be approved by the FHA. You can search condominiums in your area to see which ones qualify or seek approval for just the unit you want to buy.\nFHA Manufactured Home Loan (Title I)\nNew and used manufactured housing can also qualify for an FHA loan. You can apply through an FHA-approved lender, and some manufactured home dealers also work with lenders through the loan process. You can also apply for an FHA loan to buy the lot where you want to place the home.\nFHA Streamline Refinance\nWhen you want to exchange your existing FHA home loan for one with a lower interest rate, the FHA Streamline Refinance is the way to go. It requires less paperwork and offers quicker approval.\nFHA cash-out refinance\nAn FHA cash-out refinance allows you to access some of your home's equity by replacing your loan, taking a lump sum of cash from the value of your house, and adding that amount back into a new FHA loan's balance.\nFHA Energy Efficient Mortgage Program\nImproving your home's energy efficiency can help you save money on utility bills. The FHA EEM program can help you finance weatherization improvements and even solar and wind installations. A home energy assessment will determine the most cost-effective improvements.\nFHA Rehabilitation Mortgage Standard 203(k)\nIf you want to make extensive home improvements, the FHA 203(k) allows you to finance your project. This can be for a home you own or are buying. It's often used to repair structural issues or for additions and major upgrades.\nFHA Rehabilitation Mortgage Limited 203(k)\nLimited 203(k) loans are usually appropriate for home improvements that are less significant than those of the Standard Rehabilitation Mortgage. They're good options when you need to fund remodeling, painting, and other upgrades to improve a home or prepare it for sale.\nDig deeper: How FHA 203(k) loans work\nFHA Disaster Victims Mortgage 203(h)\nA unique mortgage among the FHA loan roster is the 203(h) for low- and moderate-income victims of major disasters. The loan offers 100% financing to rebuild or buy another home for those whose houses have been destroyed or heavily damaged in a Presidentially Declared Major Disaster Area.\nFHA Hawaiian Home Lands Mortgage\nFHA loans for Native Hawaiians allow the purchase of single-family or up to four-unit homes on Hawaiian homelands. The program addresses the need to lend to borrowers whose houses are built on leased land granted by the Department of Hawaiian Homelands.\nFHA Indian Reservations and Other Restricted Lands (248) Mortgage\nFor homes on tribal land, the Section 248 loan program works with reservation leadership to meet loan requirements. The FHA will then finance a home that adheres to FHA property standards.\nRead more: Best FHA lenders\nVA loans\nLoans backed by the Department of Veterans Affairs are a valuable benefit for borrowers with a military connection. VA mortgages are available to active-duty service members, veterans, and eligible surviving spouses. Best of all, a VA home loan typically requires no down payment.\nVA home purchase loan\nVA purchase loans require a Certificate of Eligibility (COE), and the borrower can qualify under some very generous credit standards. The loan program does not require mortgage insurance but does charge an up-front VA funding fee. The purchase loan can be used to buy or build a single-family home, a four-unit property, a (VA-approved) condominium, or a manufactured home and lot. It can also finance the purchase of a house and fund some improvements at the same time, including energy-efficient upgrades.\nDig deeper: Funding fee exemption \u2014 How it works and who qualifies\nVA cash-out refinance loan\nThe same relaxed qualifying standards apply to cash-out refis too. The VA version of the home equity tapping refinance is the same as civilian-available loans \u2014 the cash you take out can be used for any purpose. You can also use a VA cash-out refinance to refi a non-VA loan into a new VA loan.\nVA Interest Rate Reduction Refinance Loan (IRRRL)\nYou can reduce the interest rate of an existing VA loan \u2014 or replace a VA ARM with a fixed-rate loan \u2014 by applying for a VA streamline refinance (VA IRRRL). There are closing costs to pay, so you'll want to determine how long it will take before you break even on what you spend to get a lower-rate loan.\nVA Native American Direct Loan (NADL)\nThis VA loan is for military-connected borrowers who are Native American or have a spouse who is Native American looking to buy, build, or remodel a house on tribal trust land.\nLearn more: Best VA loan lenders\nUSDA loans\nHome loans backed or issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture might make you think you must be a farmer, rancher, or rural resident. And it's true, USDA loans are for borrowers just like that. However, they are also available on properties in some suburban areas.\nUSDA loans with no down payments in eligible areas are particularly suited for modest-income households.\nUSDA Section 502 Guaranteed Loan Program\nThe primary loan program of the USDA is a guaranteed loan is issued by an approved private lender to low-to-moderate-income households. Income limits apply.\nUSDA Section 502 Direct Loan Program\nUnlike the FHA and VA, the USDA offers some loans directly to borrowers through local offices. The Direct Loan Program helps low- and very-low-income households buy \"decent, safe, and sanitary housing,\" the USDA states on its website. Loan proceeds can be used to purchase, build, repair, renovate, or even relocate a home.\nUSDA Section 504 Home Repair program\nHomeowners may obtain financing \u2014 or free grants \u2014 to repair or improve a home, or to make it safer. Loans have a fixed interest rate of 1%, and grants are available for up to $10,000. The program is for very-low-income households in eligible rural areas.\nUSDA Home Repair Loans & Grants in Presidentially Declared Disasters Pilot program\nFinancially at-risk households may also obtain help during declared disasters with USDA loans and grants. The fund amounts vary each year, but the program is available year-round. However, because it is a pilot program subject to congressional funding, qualifying terms and application deadlines can vary. Consult a local USDA office for more information.\nLearn more: Best USDA loan lenders\nRead more:\nGovernment home loans for senior citizens\nThere is one government home loan designed specifically for borrowers age 62 or older. The Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM), best known as a reverse mortgage, allows homeowners to access the equity in their homes for additional income without moving out of the house. You have several options for receiving your income, including fixed monthly payments, a line of credit, and more.\nWhile the homeowners are drawing the value out of the house, they can remain in the home as long as taxes and insurance remain current.\nHECMs are available from FHA-approved lenders. While HECMs are common, you may be able to find a reverse mortgage through private lenders that the FHA does not insure.\nGovernment home loans FAQs\nCan you have two government loans at the same time?\nIf you are looking to have, for example, an FHA loan and a USDA loan at the same time, you will have to choose. Government-backed loan programs typically limit a borrower to one program at a time.\nAre there government grants to help single parents buy a home?\nGrants can be available from government programs, including state and local assistance programs. Consult a housing counseling agency in your area to see what options are available where you live.\nCan you flip a house purchased with a government-backed loan?\nThe USDA has no rules about buying, improving, and quickly selling a home \u2014 a transaction called \u201chouse flipping.\u201d Neither do VA-backed loans. FHA rules say you must own a home for more than 90 days before flipping it.\nCan you buy a foreclosed house that was financed with a government mortgage?\nYou can. Homes that were financed with a government-backed loan where the owner couldn't make the payments may be foreclosed on by the lender. So-called \"HUD homes\" are offered for sale on a government website.\nThis article was edited by Laura Grace Tarpley", "How to remove FHA mortgage insurance and lower your payments. Some advertisements and offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us. That may influence which products we write about, but it does not affect what we write about them. Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure.\nIf you were a first-time home buyer, had less-than-ideal credit, or owed a lot of debt while home shopping, then you may have chosen an FHA loan rather than a regular conventional mortgage.\nBut while this type of mortgage \u2014 insured by the Federal Housing Administration \u2014 can make buying a home easier for many Americans, it also comes with a major drawback: FHA mortgage insurance premiums.\nThis insurance not only increases the up-front closing costs of your loan, but it also comes with an annual fee that\u2019s spread across the year, increasing your monthly payments as a result. It can also be impossible to remove \u2014 but it is possible in some cases.\nAre you tired of paying for MIP on your FHA mortgage loan? Here\u2019s everything you need to know about removing FHA mortgage insurance, including when doing so might be a good idea.\nIn this article:\nWhat is FHA mortgage insurance?\nAn FHA mortgage insurance premium (MIP) is a type of mortgage insurance that is required on FHA loans. Like other forms of mortgage insurance, it is designed to protect FHA-approved lenders against losses if you fail to make your monthly payments. (Essentially, if you default on your loan, your mortgage insurance will repay your lender for a portion of the money it lost.)\nThe benefit of FHA mortgage insurance is that it lessens the risk FHA lenders take on with borrowers. This often allows them to take on borrowers with less-than-perfect credit scores or smaller down payments than other loan programs are able to accept.\nFHA mortgage insurance premiums come in two forms: an up-front premium, which is paid at closing, and annual premiums, which you\u2019ll pay as part of your monthly mortgage payment. The cost of each is laid out below:\n-\nUp-front MIP: 1.75% of your total loan amount\n-\nAnnual MIP: Varies from 0.45% to 1.05% of the loan amount, depending on the term, size, and loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of your home loan\nIn most cases, FHA mortgage insurance lasts for the life of the loan. But if you make a down payment of 10% or more, it may only last for 11 years.\nStep-by-step guide on how to remove FHA mortgage insurance\nPaying the mandatory FHA mortgage insurance is one of the biggest drawbacks for homeowners with FHA loans. If you\u2019re eager to remove the extra burden, here\u2019s a step-by-step guide on how to do it.\n1. Check your eligibility\nYou might qualify to eliminate your FHA mortgage insurance premium automatically and without refinancing.\nThis is possible if one of these two scenarios applies to you:\nYour loan origination date was between Jan. 1, 2001, and June 2, 2013. In this case, your MIP will be canceled when you reach a loan-to-value ratio of 78% or have 22% equity in your home.\nYour loan origination date was June 3, 2013, or later, and you made a down payment of at least 10%. In this case, your MIP will be canceled after 11 years. (For down payments of less than 10%, you\u2019ll pay mortgage insurance for the life of the loan unless you refinance.)\n2. Refinance your loan\nIf you don\u2019t meet the requirements for automatic MIP removal after reaching 11 years or 22% equity, then you\u2019ll need to refinance your FHA loan to get rid of mortgage insurance.\nYou can do this using several loan types, including a conventional loan, a USDA loan, or a VA loan, though the latter two are reserved for specific borrower types (USDA loans are only for borrowers in rural parts of the country, while VA loans are just for veterans and military members). For most people, refinancing from an FHA loan into a conventional loan will be the most suitable choice.\nTo qualify for a conventional loan with most mortgage lenders, you\u2019ll typically need a 620 credit score and a debt-to-income ratio of 45% or less. You will also need at least 20% equity in your home (anything less than this typically requires its own type of mortgage insurance called private mortgage insurance, or PMI).\n3. Talk to your lender\nIf you can't qualify for MIP cancellation or refinancing and are struggling to keep up with your FHA mortgage payments, contact your lender. They can discuss potential solutions with you. This might include modifying your loan, which allows you to change the terms of your loan without refinancing, or you might be able to put your mortgage loan in forbearance. This gives you a temporary pause or reduction on payments while you get back on your feet.\nIn some cases, you might also be able to explore an FHA Streamline Refinance, which lets you refinance into a new FHA loan. Since this new loan would likely have a lower balance than your first one, it may qualify you for a lower MIP rate, which could reduce your monthly payment as well.\nHow much does FHA MIP cost?\nWhen you take out an FHA loan, you must pay an up-front mortgage insurance premium worth 1.75% of the original mortgage principal at closing, plus an annual MIP, which is divided out among your monthly mortgage payments. The cost of your annual MIP will vary depending on your mortgage size, term length, and loan-to-value ratio.\nLet\u2019s say you borrow $150,000 to purchase your home. In this case, you\u2019ll pay an up-front mortgage insurance premium of $2,625 at closing and annual MIPs of anywhere from 0.45% to 1.05% of the total mortgage \u2014 so, around $675 to $1,575 each year (or $56 to $131 per month).\nWhat happens after removing your FHA mortgage insurance?\nThe most noticeable impact of removing your FHA mortgage insurance is that you\u2019ll have a lower monthly mortgage payment. With this extra room in your budget, you could put more cash toward an emergency fund or start beefing up your retirement savings. You could also put those savings back into your home, aggressively paying down the principal on your mortgage, or use it to pay for home improvements that increase your home\u2019s value.\nShould you eliminate FHA mortgage insurance from your loan?\nIn two scenarios, you can automatically eliminate FHA mortgage insurance from your loan (see eligibility criteria above). If you fit into those parameters, and removing insurance is free or charge, then there\u2019s no downside to it. You\u2019ll simply enjoy fewer costs and lower monthly payments.\nIf you don\u2019t fall into those two categories, though, you\u2019ll need to think carefully about whether refinancing to remove your FHA mortgage insurance is the right move. For one, you\u2019ll need to either meet VA or USDA loan eligibility requirements to qualify or, in the case of conventional loans, have at least a 22% equity stake in your home to avoid paying for private mortgage insurance.\nBeyond this, refinancing also comes with fees. According to Freddie Mac, the typical refinance costs anywhere from 3% to 6% of the total loan amount, so on a $200,000 balance, you\u2019d pay between $6,000 to $12,000 just to refinance. You\u2019ll want to run the numbers and determine if removing MIP would save you this much (and ideally more) in the long run. If it won\u2019t, or if you don\u2019t plan to be in the home very long, then keeping your loan as-is might be the better move.\nIf you\u2019re unsure, talk to a loan officer about your options. They can walk you through the math and ensure you\u2019re making the right move for your goals and budget.\nFHA mortgage insurance removal FAQs\nWhat is the difference between MIP and PMI?\nMortgage insurance premium (MIP) and private mortgage insurance (PMI) are both insurance policies that protect lenders in case you default on your mortgage. The main difference between the two is that PMI applies to conventional loans with less than 20% down payments, while MIP is administered by the Federal Housing Administration and applies specifically to FHA loans.\nIs it necessary to have mortgage insurance?\nIt may be. If you take out a conventional loan but put down less than 20%, lenders will typically require you to pay private mortgage insurance (PMI) to mitigate their risk in case you default on the loan. However, once you\u2019ve built up enough equity in your home \u2014 usually when the loan-to-value ratio reaches 80% \u2014 you can request that the PMI be canceled. For FHA loans, mortgage insurance is mandatory regardless of your down payment amount. You\u2019ll pay it both upfront and as part of your monthly mortgage payment.\nCan I reduce my mortgage insurance premium?\nIf you don\u2019t qualify to remove FHA MIP and can\u2019t refinance into a conventional loan, you could possibly reduce your MIP with an FHA Streamline Refinance. This program allows you to refinance your FHA loan into a new FHA loan so you can save money. You\u2019ll probably still have to pay MIP, but it could be more affordable than with your original mortgage.\nWhen can you get rid of mortgage insurance on FHA loans?\nIf you made at least a 10% down payment upon buying the house, you can cancel MIP after 11 years have passed on your loan. Your MIP might also be cancellable if it was originated prior to June 3, 2013, and meets other conditions. Otherwise, you will need to refinance into a non-FHA loan in order to remove MIP from your monthly payments.\nThis article was edited by Laura Grace Tarpley.", "FHA vs. conventional loan: Which should you choose?. Some advertisements and offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us. That may influence which products we write about, but it does not affect what we write about them. Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure.\nIf you\u2019re on the hunt for a new home, you\u2019re probably planning to take out a mortgage to finance the purchase. You\u2019ll have to decide which kind of home loan makes the most financial sense for your situation.\nTwo popular options for homeowners are FHA and conventional loans. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about these two types of mortgage loans to help you make an informed decision.\nLearn more: Pros and cons of FHA loans\nIn this article:\nFHA vs. conventional loans: An overview\nAn FHA loan is a mortgage insured by the Federal Housing Administration \u2014 which is overseen by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) \u2014 and issued by banks, credit unions, and other approved FHA lenders.\nBecause an FHA loan is government-backed, it typically requires a lower credit score and minimum down payment than conventional loans and some other mortgage programs. These factors make FHA loans especially popular with first-time home buyers with little savings or less-than-ideal FICO scores.\nUnlike an FHA loan, a conventional loan isn\u2019t insured by any government agency, which can make it riskier for the mortgage lender. As a result, conventional mortgages typically have stricter eligibility requirements, which means you may need a higher credit score and a larger down payment to qualify.\nConventional loans can be conforming or non-conforming loans. Conforming loans meet Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac standards and can\u2019t exceed borrowing limits set by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). Non-conforming mortgages (like jumbo loans) exceed those conforming loan limits.\nYou can apply for conventional loans at most banks, credit unions, and mortgage lenders.\nRead more: The best mortgage lenders right now\nConventional loan vs. FHA loan: Key differences\nIn a nutshell, FHA loans have more lenient down payment and credit score requirements than conventional loans, but they come with mortgage insurance and require an FHA-approved appraisal. Though conventional loans have higher loan limits and don\u2019t require mortgage insurance when you put 20% down, they\u2019re a bit harder to qualify for than FHA loans.\nHere\u2019s a more detailed view of the differences between FHA and conventional loans to help you make the right decision.\nCredit score minimum\nLenders will always look at your credit score, whether you\u2019re applying for an FHA or a conventional loan. Most lenders use the FICO scoring model, which ranges from 300 to 850 points. The higher your score, the more trustworthy you are as a borrower from a lender\u2019s point of view.\nYou generally need a minimum credit score of 620 to be eligible for a conventional mortgage. You can qualify for an FHA home loan with a credit score as low as 500 with a 10% down payment or 580 with a 3.5% down payment.\nAppraisal process\nIf you\u2019re buying a home with a conventional loan, your lender will schedule a home appraisal to ensure the property has sufficient value. This way, both you and the lender know the amount you are paying is comparable to the actual home value.\nThe FHA appraisal process is more demanding than one for a conventional loan. Your property must meet the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s minimum property requirements, so the appraiser will look for specific safety and construction issues.\nSo, the main difference between the two in this aspect is that conventional loan appraisers do not hold your property to HUD's exact standards, whereas FHA appraisers do.\nDown payment requirements\nYou only need to put 3.5% down for FHA loans if your credit score is 580 or higher. If your credit score falls between 500 and 579, you\u2019ll need to come up with a higher down payment of 10%.\nDown payment requirements for conventional loans vary from lender to lender. Some may only require a minimum 3% down payment, while other lenders may ask you to put at least 5% down.\nLearn more: How to get a mortgage with a 1% down payment\nMortgage insurance\nMortgage insurance protects your lender if you default on your loan.\nFor conventional loans, you\u2019ll need to pay private mortgage insurance (PMI) if you put less than 20% down. According to the government-sponsored entity Freddie Mac, you can expect to pay between $30 and $70 monthly per $100,000 financed.\nFor FHA loans, you must pay a mortgage insurance premium (MIP) for the life of the loan, regardless of how much you put down. The only exceptions are if your loan origination date was June 3, 2013, or later, and you made a down payment of at least 10%. In this case, your FHA mortgage insurance is removed after 11 years. You can also remove FHA MIP if your loan origination date was between Jan. 1, 2001, and June 2, 2013, and you\u2019ve reached 22% equity in your home.\nMIP consists of two parts: the up-front mortgage premium, which is 1.75% of your base loan amount, and the annual MIP, which depends on various factors.\nLearn more: How to get rid of PMI\nLoan limits\nLoan limits cap the amount you can borrow for a house, so you\u2019ll want to pay attention to the loan limit for the area where you\u2019re shopping for homes.\nThe Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) publishes annual conforming loan limits that apply to all conventional loans. For 2025, the conforming loan limit for one-unit single-family homes is $806,500, with higher-cost areas at $1,209,750. If you need to borrow more, you must take out a jumbo loan.\nThe 2025 FHA loan limit for a one-unit property in a lower-cost area is $524,225, but in high-cost areas such as Los Angeles, the ceiling is also $1,209,750. Visit the HUD website for more information on FHA mortgage limits.\nRead more: Requirements to get an FHA loan\nCan you refinance from an FHA loan to a conventional loan?\nYes, you can refinance out of an FHA loan if you meet the eligibility for a conventional loan, such as having a credit score of at least 620 and a debt-to-income ratio (DTI) below 50%. Though refinancing from an FHA loan to a conventional loan may not be for everyone, it\u2019s worth considering if you want to remove FHA mortgage insurance and potentially access larger loan amounts.\nLearn more: How to refinance from an FHA to conventional loan\nCan you refinance from a conventional loan to a FHA loan?\nYou can refinance from a conventional loan into an FHA loan with two specific types of refinancing: an FHA cash-out refinance or FHA 203(k) refinance, two options available to homeowners with any type of loan. But you typically won\u2019t want to do so unless it\u2019s a last resort.\nBy converting into an FHA loan, you\u2019ll eat away at your equity with the mandatory FHA mortgage insurance charges, regardless of how much equity you\u2019ve built up. So, though the rates may be lower on FHA loans, it may not make financial sense to refinance into one when you factor in MIP, closing costs, and other expenses associated with it.\nLearn more: How much are FHA loan closing costs?\nFHA loan vs. conventional loan: Which is better?\nIt depends. A conventional loan might be better if you have good or excellent credit and can manage a 20% down payment since you\u2019ll most likely qualify for an affordable mortgage rate and avoid PMI. However, a loan backed by the FHA might be your only option if you have a less-than-ideal credit score that falls anywhere between the 500s or low 600s.\nEven if you have a small down payment, it might be worth choosing a conventional loan so you don\u2019t have to pay for FHA mortgage insurance for the life of the loan. Talk with mortgage lenders to compare overall costs and determine which mortgage makes the most sense mathematically.\nLearn more:\nFHA vs. conventional loans FAQs\nWhat is the downside to an FHA loan?\nOne of the biggest downsides of an FHA loan is the up-front and annual mortgage insurance, which can be tricky to get rid of. The up-front mortgage insurance premium costs 1.75% of the original mortgage principal at closing, and the annual MIP varies depending on your mortgage size, term length, and loan-to-value. Another downside to FHA loans is the loan limit. In most parts of the U.S., FHA loans only allow you to borrow up to $524,225 for a one-unit property, whereas conventional loans may allow you to borrow up to $806,500.\nWhat is the downside of a conventional loan?\nOne disadvantage of a conventional loan is that the rates may be higher for people with less-than-great credit scores than with other types of mortgages. Conventional loans typically have stricter eligibility requirements than government-backed loans like FHA loans.\nWhy do sellers want conventional over FHA loans?\nTo some sellers, a homebuyer who qualifies for conventional financing is less risky and more trustworthy than borrowers who qualify for an FHA loan. This is because conventional loans typically require a higher credit score and more money down, which means those who qualify for these loans might be considered more financially responsible and creditworthy.\nThis article was edited by Laura Grace Tarpley"]}, {"topic": 47, "name": "NYC Mayoral Race", "keywords": "mamdani, cuomo, primary, new, york, democratic, democrats, progressive, sanders, mamdanis", "documents": ["Cuomo's lead shrinks with under one week until New York City mayoral primary: poll.

Who\u2019s afraid of Zohran Mamdani? The answer, it would seem, is the entire establishment. The 33-year-old democratic socialist and New York City mayoral candidate has surged in the polls in recent weeks, netting endorsements not just from progressive voices like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders but also his fellow candidates for the mayoralty, with Brad Lander and Michael Blake taking advantage of the ranked-choice voting system in the primary and cross-endorsing Mamdani\u2019s campaign.\nWith the primary just around the corner, polls have Mamdani closing the gap on Andrew Cuomo, the disgraced former governor of New York. This has spooked the establishment, which is now doing everything it can to stop Mamdani\u2019s rise.\nTake Michael Bloomberg, who endorsed Cuomo earlier this month and followed this up with a $5m donation to a pro-Cuomo Pac. The largesse appears motivated not by admiration for Cuomo \u2013 during his mayoralty, sources told the New York Times that Bloomberg saw Cuomo as \u201cthe epitome of the self-interested, horse-trading political culture he has long stood against\u201d \u2013 but animosity towards Mamdani and his policies.\nMamdani wants to increase taxes on residents earning more than $1m a year, increase corporate taxes and freeze rents: policies that aren\u2019t exactly popular with the billionaire set.\nBronx congressman Ritchie Torres (who was once progressive but moved steadily away from that and now receives fundraising assistance from far-right donors) is another establishment Democrat trying to prevent a Mamdani win at all costs. Torres, who makes his pro-Israel positions explicit, has criticized Mamdani for pro-Palestine comments. Torres has even said he won\u2019t run for governor in 2026 if a socialist like Mamdani becomes the mayor because it will \u201crevolutionize the political landscape\u201d.\nThe New York Times\u2019 editorial board is also aghast at Mamdani\u2019s sudden popularity. On Monday, it published a piece urging New Yorkers to completely leave the candidate off their ranked-choice ballot, arguing that the assemblyman is woefully underqualified for office and has a bunch of wacky progressive ideas that will never work including free buses and frozen rent. The Times, which announced almost a year ago that it will not make endorsements in local elections, did not officially endorse a candidate but it certainly didn\u2019t tell people not to put Cuomo on the ballot. It seems being accused of sexually harassing multiple women and then going after those women in an aggressive and intrusive way (including demanding gynecological records) isn\u2019t as disqualifying as progressive policies. And, of course, the sexual harassment is just one of many scandals that Cuomo has weathered, including allegations he covered up nursing home deaths during the pandemic.\nThe Atlantic also came out with an anti-Mamdani piece, albeit one that was more subtle and which focused on the process rather than the personality. Staff writer Annie Lowrey argued that ranked-choice voting in a mayor primary, used by New York City since 2021, is not truly democratic: \u201cWithout ranked-choice voting, Cuomo would probably steamroll his competition. With ranked-choice voting, Mamdani could defeat him.\u201d While there are problems with ranked choice (as there are with first-past-the-post systems), I think the bigger democratic threat might be a system in which a billionaire can swoop in with millions to prop up their preferred candidate at the last minute.\nAll of this is anti-Mamdani mobilization is depressingly predictable: the Democratic establishment is allergic to fresh blood and new thinking. Shortly after Trump won the election last year, and the Democrats also lost the House and the Senate, Ocasio-Cortez launched a bid to become the lead Democrat on the House oversight committee, which is an important minority leadership position. Ocasio-Cortez has become a lot more establishment-friendly since getting into power in 2018 (New York Magazine even decreed in 2023 that she is just a \u201cRegular Old Democrat Now\u201d), but she\u2019s still not centrist enough for the Democrats, it seems. Nancy Pelosi reportedly sabotaged the 35-year-old congresswoman\u2019s ambitions and ensured that 74-year-old Gerry Connolly, who had esophagus cancer at the time, got the job instead. Connolly died age 75 earlier this year, becoming the sixth House Democrat to have died in office in 12 months.\nThen there\u2019s the Democratic backlash to David Hogg, the young Parkland shooting survivor turned politico. The 25-year-old was briefly vice-chair of the Democratic national committee but stepped on powerful toes by criticizing the party for its \u201cseniority politics\u201d. Hogg, who has said that he\u2019s worried about his generation losing faith in democracy, pitched competitive primaries which challenged Democratic incumbents who had become too complacent, injecting new blood into the party. This did not go down well and various members of the DNC had voted to hold new vice-chair elections that could have led to his ouster. Instead of waiting to be kicked out, Hogg recently said he would step away from the role.\nI am not a Mamdani evangelist, but while some of his ideas are a little pie in the sky, he\u2019s authentic and ready to fight for normal people rather than corporate interests. Sure, he doesn\u2019t have a lot of experience. But he has a huge amount of potential. He\u2019s managed to get at least 26,000 New Yorkers to volunteer for him. And I don\u2019t mean they\u2019ve sent a couple of text messages: one week they knocked on almost 100,000 doors. Michael Spear, a professor of history and political science at a Brooklyn college, told Jacobin the degree to which Mamdani\u2019s campaign has galvanized New York City voters is unprecedented: \u201cI don\u2019t think there is anything like it\u201d in New York history.\nNobody in the Democratic establishment is quite so delusional that they think the party is doing great. Everyone knows there is a need for change and yet they seem keen to sabotage anyone who might bring that change. Instead of rallying around fresh talent like Mamdani that can clearly mobilize young voters, the Democrats are mulling a $20m plan to try to manufacture a \u201cJoe Rogan of the left\u201d who can connect with young men, rather than support an authentic grassroots candidate who is already connecting with them.\nWill centrist interests prevail in New York? We won\u2019t know until, at the very earliest, late on primary night, 24 June. Whatever happens, though, you can bet that Democrats will continue to do their very best to kneecap anyone who wants to drag them way from their obsession with doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.", "NYC Mayoral Race Poll Shows Progressive Zohran Mamdani Closing In on Cuomo. Democratic socialist assemblymember Zohran Mamdani has come within striking distance of Andrew Cuomo in newly released polling for the upcoming New York City mayoral election, with the breakout candidate being within a margin of error of triumphing over the disgraced governor in a head-to-head primary race.\nA Data for Progress survey of likely Democratic primary voters found that Mamdani is just seven points behind Cuomo in the first round of New York City\u2019s ranked choice voting system, with other left-leaning candidates like Brad Lander garnering a proportion of higher rankings. Every candidate but Mamdani and Cuomo is in the single digits.\nAs other candidates are eliminated in subsequent rounds, Cuomo\u2019s lead grows smaller. In the final round, in a head-to-head race between the two, Cuomo leads by just two points, garnering 51 percent of the vote, with Mamdani at 49 percent. The margin of error for the poll is plus or minus three points.\nCrucially, the poll was conducted between May 30 and June 4 \u2014 ending just a day before Mamdani secured the endorsement of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York), who endorsed the left-wing candidate following his skillful performance at the first mayoral debate and said she would rank him first on her primary ballot.\nThe endorsement from such a high profile politician may have been particularly important, as polls have suggested that one of Mamdani\u2019s largest roadblocks is name recognition over the former governor. A Data for Progress poll conducted in March, for instance, found that Cuomo led Mamdani by 24 points in the first round of voting, while a faceoff between the two would have Cuomo winning by 70 percent to Mamdani\u2019s 30 percent.\nBut, due in part to a massive canvassing campaign for Mamdani and his often-viral social media videos, Mamdani has been surging in recognition and popularity. His policy platform of making New York City more affordable with proposals like a citywide rent freeze for rent stabilized apartments stands, for young voters especially, in sharp contrast to Cuomo \u2014 a Democratic establishment candidate who is well-known, but perhaps for the wrong reasons.\nMeanwhile, Data for Progress\u2019s latest polling suggests that Mamdani has even more room to grow in terms of name recognition and popularity.\nAccording to the survey, 28 percent of respondents said they had not heard enough about Mamdani to form an opinion. Well over half, or 58 percent, said they had a favorable opinion of him, versus only 15 percent who said they had an unfavorable view \u2014 a 43-point gap.\nOn the other hand, the polling found that voters have a net unfavorable opinion of Cuomo, with 48 percent saying they favor him while 4 percent said they view him unfavorably.\nKeep the press free.

Give Now", "NAACP Files Intent To Sue Elon Musk's AI Company Over Supercomputer Air Pollution. MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 The NAACP and an environmental group said Tuesday that they intend to sue Elon Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence company xAI over concerns about air pollution generated by a supercomputer facility located near predominantly Black communities in Memphis.\nThe xAI data center began operating last year, powered in part by pollution-emitting gas turbines, without first applying for a permit. Officials have said an exemption allowed them to operate for up to 364 days without a permit, but Southern Environmental Law Center attorney Patrick Anderson said at a news conference that there is no such exemption for turbines \u2014 and that regardless, it has now been more than 364 days.\nA 60-day notice of an intent to sue, a prerequisite to filing a lawsuit under the Clean Air Act, was sent to xAI in a letter. The SELC is representing the NAACP in its possible legal challenge against xAI and its permit application, now being considered by the Shelby County Health Department.\nThe xAI company responds\nThe company said Tuesday that it takes its commitment to the community and environment seriously.\n\u201cThe temporary power generation units are operating in compliance with all applicable laws,\u201d an xAI statement said.\nMusk\u2019s xAI has said the turbines will be equipped with technology to reduce emissions \u2014 and that it\u2019s already boosting the city\u2019s economy by investing billions of dollars in the supercomputer facility, paying millions in local taxes and creating hundreds of jobs. The company also is spending $35 million to build a power substation and $80 million to build a water recycling plant to the support Memphis, Light, Gas and Water, the local utility.\nThe chamber of commerce in Memphis made a surprise announcement in June 2024 that xAI planned to build a supercomputer in the city. The data center quickly set up shop in an industrial park south Memphis, near factories and a gas-powered plant operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority.\nWhat opponents are saying\nOpponents say the supercomputing center is stressing the power grid. They contend that the turbines emit smog and carbon dioxide, pollutants that cause lung irritation such as nitrogen oxides and the carcinogen formaldehyde.\nThe SELC said the use of the turbines violates the Clean Air Act, and that residents who live near the xAI facility already face cancer risks at four times the national average. The group also has sent a petition to the Environmental Protection Agency.\nCritics say xAI installed the turbines without any oversight or notice to the community. The company requests to operate 15 turbines at the site, but the SELC said it hired a firm to fly over the facility and found up to 35 turbines operating there at times.\nThe permit itself says emissions from the site \u201cwill be an area source for hazardous air pollutants.\u201d A permit would allow the health department, which has received 1,700 public comments about the permit, to monitor air quality near the facility.\nA contentious public meeting\nOpponents of the facility say city leaders have not been transparent with the community about their dealings with xAI, and they are sacrificing the health of residents in return for financial benefit.\nAt a community meeting hosted by the county health department in April, many of the people speaking in opposition cited the additional pollution burden in a city that already received an \u201cF\u201d grade for ozone pollution from the American Lung Association.\nA statement read by xAI\u2019s Brent Mayo at the meeting said the company wants to \u201cstrengthen the fabric of the community,\u201d and estimated that tax revenues from the data center are likely to exceed $100 million by next year.\n\u201cThis tax revenue will support vital programs like public safety, health and human services, education, firefighters, police, parks and so much more,\u201d said the statement.\nThe company also apparently wants to expand: The chamber of commerce said in March that xAI had purchased a 1 million square-foot property at a second location, not far from the current facility.\nThe mayor of Memphis weighs in\nMayor Paul Young said In his weekly newsletter Friday that an ordinance now requires that 25% of xAI\u2019s city property tax revenue be reinvested directly into neighborhoods within 5 miles of the facility.\nYoung also said that no tax incentives or public dollars are tied to the project.\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear, this isn\u2019t a debate between the environment and economics,\u201d Young said. \u201cIt\u2019s about putting people before politics. It\u2019s about building something better for communities that have waited far too long for real investment.\u201d\nBoxtown punches back\nOne nearby neighborhood dealing with decades of industrial pollution is Boxtown, a tight-knit community founded by freed slaves in the 1860s. It was named Boxtown after residents used material dumped from railroad boxcars to fortify their homes. The area features houses, wooded areas and wetlands, and its inhabitants are mostly working class residents.\nBoxtown won a victory in 2021 against two corporations that sought to build an oil pipeline through the area. Valero and Plains All American Pipeline canceled the project after protests by residents and activists led by State Rep. Justin J. Pearson, who called it a potential danger to the community and an aquifer that provides clean drinking water to Memphis.\nPearson, who represents nearby neighborhoods, said \u201cclean air is a human right\u201d as he called for people in Memphis to unite against xAI.\n\u201cThere is not a person, no matter how wealthy or how powerful, that can deny the fact that everybody has a right to breathe clean air,\u201d said Pearson, who compared the fight against xAI to David and Goliath.\n\u201cWe\u2019re all right to be David, because we know how the story ends,\u201d he said.\n____\nReporter Travis Loller contributed from Nashville, Tenn.", "'How come I can\u2019t breathe?': Musk's data company draws a backlash in Memphis. \u2018How come I can\u2019t breathe?': Musk\u2019s data company draws a backlash in Memphis\nThe company\u2019s turbines \u2014 enough to power 280,000 homes \u2014 run without emission controls in an area that leads Tennessee in asthma hospitalizations.\nMEMPHIS, Tennessee \u2014 Elon Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence company is belching smog-forming pollution into an area of South Memphis that already leads the state in emergency department visits for asthma.\nNone of the 35 methane gas turbines that help power xAI\u2019s massive supercomputer is equipped with pollution controls typically required by federal rules.\nThe company has no Clean Air Act permits.\nIn just 11 months since the company arrived in Memphis, xAI has become one of Shelby County\u2019s largest emitters of smog-producing nitrogen oxides, according to calculations by environmental groups whose data has been reviewed by POLITICO\u2019s E&E News. The plant is in an area whose air is already considered unhealthy due to smog.\nThe turbines spew nitrogen oxides, also known as NOx, at an estimated rate of 1,200 to 2,000 tons a year \u2014 far more than the gas-fired power plant across the street or the oil refinery down the road. That\u2019s according to calculations by the Southern Environmental Law Center, a nonpartisan legal advocacy group that focuses on the South, which used turbine manufacturer spec sheets to estimate xAI\u2019s annual emissions and compare them with pollution that other South Memphis plants have reported to the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s National Emissions Inventory.\nThe turbines were necessary to get the third version of the company\u2019s AI chatbot up and running in time, Musk said at the product\u2019s launch in February, adding: \u201cWe have generators on one side of the building, just trailer after trailer of generators until we can get the utility power to come in.\u201d He has not publicly addressed the pollution concerns and did not respond to requests for comment about the turbines powering the plant and their lack of pollution controls.\nJust three miles away is Boxtown, a secluded neighborhood that officially became part of the city of Memphis in 1968, the year that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated at the Lorraine Motel downtown. While the annexation had come with the promise of connecting Boxtown to municipal utilities, many homes still had no running water or sewage service as late as the 1970s.\nToday, more than 90 percent of residents living in Boxtown\u2019s ZIP code are Black, with a median household income of $36,000, according to the Census Bureau. It\u2019s also home to more than 17 industrial facilities \u2014 some of which share an industrial park with xAI \u2014 that release enough toxic pollution to require registration with EPA\u2019s Toxics Release Inventory.\n\u201cI can\u2019t breathe at home, it smells like gas outside,\u201d Boxtown resident Alexis Humphreys said through tears, holding up her asthma inhaler during a public hearing about the turbines on April 25. \u201cHow come I can\u2019t breathe at home and y\u2019all get to breathe at home?\u201d\nTogether the turbines produce enough energy to power 280,000 homes. XAI has been relying on them because the data processing center\u2019s voracious appetite for energy has outpaced electric utilities\u2019 ability to serve it.\nThe turbines are only temporary and don\u2019t require federal permits for their emissions of NOx and other hazardous air pollutants like formaldehyde, xAI\u2019s environmental consultant, Shannon Lynn, said during a webinar hosted by the Memphis Chamber of Commerce. The argument appears to rely on a loophole in federal regulations that environmental groups and former EPA officials say shouldn\u2019t apply to the situation.\nIn January, facing pressure from neighbors and environmental groups, xAI applied for permits for 15 of its turbines, which it says will be permanent.\nBut Lynn said the company will wait until its application is approved before it installs pollution controls on the turbines it keeps onsite. That installation \u201cwill make xAI the lowest-emitting facility in the country,\u201d the company\u2019s local representative, Brent Mayo, said at a permit hearing about the turbines.\nMayo and Lynn didn\u2019t respond to calls and texts from POLITICO\u2019s E&E News requesting comment and have not said publicly how much longer the \u201ctemporary\u201d turbines will remain onsite. Musk did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe strategy violates the Clean Air Act, argued Bruce Buckheit, who formerly directed EPA\u2019s air enforcement division. At a minimum, he said, the turbines that will remain onsite should have had pollution controls from the start.\n\u201cThere needs to be a permit beforehand,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t just get that first year for free.\u201d\nThe Memphis xAI showdown could become a national test case for artificial intelligence, which demands more electricity than regular internet searches to complete even simple tasks. Utilities across the country have struggled to keep up with the electricity demands of \u201chyper users\u201d like data centers, which are often left to find their own power sources behind the meter.\nThe Trump administration, while allowing Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency to eliminate programs dedicated to reducing the disproportionate amount of pollution in communities of color, has also vowed to support artificial intelligence. Before EPA said it would fire or reassign some 450 employees working on environmental justice initiatives late last month, the agency listed making \u201cthe United States the artificial intelligence capital of the world\u201d among five agency priorities \u201cthat will guide EPA\u2019s work.\u201d EPA has also issued new guidance easing pollution rules for some internal combustion engines commonly used by data centers.\n\u201cData centers are a highly competitive space, and other companies are watching what xAI does,\u201d said Amanda Garcia, senior attorney for the SELC, which has advocated for data centers to use more renewable energy to reduce their pollution and draw from the grid. \u201dRight now, what xAI is doing is essentially running a power plant without a permit, and it has a real risk of harming people\u2019s health.\u201d\nXAI\u2019s main product is Musk\u2019s chatbot, Grok, which also generates images. It has become known for having fewer user guardrails than other artificial intelligence programs, like ChatGPT, which often prevent users from requesting images that violate copyright standards or are deemed insensitive. Grok allows users to make deepfakes depicting things like Mickey Mouse wearing a Nazi uniform. Musk has called it \u201cthe most fun AI in the world.\u201d\nBoxtown residents say they have been paying for the images with their health.\nAt a public hearing on the xAI permits at Fairley High School on April 25, multiple residents described cases of asthma and cancer in their families they attribute to air pollution, asking for the Shelby County Department of Health to deny xAI\u2019s permit and shut down all the turbines. Many have health conditions, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, that predate xAI\u2019s arrival in South Memphis. But NOx emissions are known to worsen lung conditions, and residents fear that the sheer volume released by xAI will further harm their health. Some, like Humphreys, showed their inhalers and portable oxygen tanks as proof of the damage.\nMany see xAI as just the latest example of Memphis designating their community as a \u201csacrifice zone,\u201d said KeShaun Pearson, who leads the nonprofit Memphis Community Against Pollution. Both his grandmothers died of cancer in their 60s, and Pearson blames pollution for their deaths.\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing when you grow up and realize how redlining has allowed these industries to kill your family,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cElon Musk is a representation of the oligarchy we already knew was operating under Jim Crow. It\u2019s a familiar evil.\u201d\n\u2018Elvis is in the building\u2019\nThe Greater Memphis Chamber of Commerce heralds xAI\u2019s arrival as a success.\nAn organization dedicated to economic development, the chamber actively courted xAI last spring, its President Ted Townsend said in an interview. But the decision about where to host the supercomputer powering Musk\u2019s company came down to electricity. Colossus, as Musk calls it, contained some 100,000 computer chips at the time and demanded 150 megawatts of power.\nTownsend and the head of Memphis Light, Gas and Water signed nondisclosure agreements with xAI and in private meetings helped the company craft a plan, Townsend told POLITICO\u2019s E&E News in an interview. They directed xAI to a former oven factory vacated just a couple of years prior that was already equipped with a gas hookup and a substation that could immediately supply 8 MW of power. During the meetings, the utility agreed to support xAI\u2019s request for 150 MW, which would need approval from the Tennessee Valley Authority\u2019s board of directors.\n\u201cThe AI race is just that, it\u2019s a race,\u201d Townsend said. \u201cSo expediting and building out infrastructure as quickly as possible in the most appropriate ways, within the lines of regulations and laws, that is how we have been instructed and guided.\u201d\nThe Memphis utility declined to make its president, Doug McGowen, available for an interview or answer written questions about xAI\u2019s power supply, referring all comment requests to the Chamber of Commerce.\nLeft out of those negotiations were the Memphis City Council; the county Board of Commissioners; and TVA, whose board ultimately had to approve any requests for more than 100 MW of power.\nThey only learned about the deal in early June, after the deal was done, when Musk announced it with a post on X referencing Memphis\u2019 illustrious music history: \u201cElvis is in the building.\u201d\nAlmost immediately after becoming public, the deal sparked concerns about how xAI\u2019s power use would affect Memphis residents. As recently as 2022, high demand during winter storms has forced TVA to undergo rolling blackouts on some of the coldest days.\nMemphis Light, Gas and Water officials told the public not to worry, saying xAI had brought its own gas generators to power the data center before the TVA board voted on the power request. The company could also rely on the turbines when the authority called on industrial users to reduce their draw during times of high demand.\nTypically, stationary gas turbines need permits before they can be turned on due to the levels of NOx and other pollutants they generate. The permitting process helps ensure that emitters use technology to limit air pollution. There are more stringent guidelines for NOx emissions in an already smoggy area like Shelby County. Smog, a mixture of gases and chemicals, can exacerbate lung diseases like asthma and increase hospital visits.\nOther data centers have sought permits for the same make and model of gas turbines used by xAI before beginning construction.\nBut in August, the Shelby County Health Department said it had not issued any permits for the turbines, writing in a letter that EPA had agreed the department \u201cdoes not currently have authority regarding those mobile gas burning turbines\u201d because they were only temporary.\nThe letter included a copy of the request that department Director Michelle Taylor had made to EPA earlier that month saying that \u201ca statement acknowledging mobile source gas-powered turbines do not require a local Title V permit until they have remained in the same location for more than 364 days would be advantageous to all parties concerned.\u201d\nThat explanation didn\u2019t make sense to the SELC\u2019s Garcia. The Health Department seemed to be referencing an exemption in the law for smaller gas generators, like those used to power asphalt crushers for road projects. But Garcia said the turbines at xAI were big enough and generated enough electricity that they should instead have had to obtain permits as stationary sources, even if they were portable.\nThe SELC told the Health Department as much in multiple letters, but neither Shelby County nor xAI has cited a legal argument for why the turbines should be exempt.\nLocals feared Memphis had become yet another example of Musk\u2019s companies pushing fast-paced development while disregarding environmental regulations. There was Tesla, which in 2021 was cited for 33 air quality violations in California; SpaceX, which has been fined by Texas for allegedly dumping industrial wastewater without a permit; and Musk\u2019s underground tunneling business, The Boring Co., which was also fined by Texas for failing to get a permit to discharge industrial stormwater.\nSince August, the number of gas turbines at the xAI site has only grown, with information only coming to light after community pushback.\nMemphis Light, Gas and Water and chamber officials initially suggested last summer there were 18 turbines of varying sizes. But then, when xAI filed a permit application in January, it listed 15 machines, at 16 MW each. Then, at the end of March, environmental groups flew over the facility and came back with aerial photos showing 35 turbines onsite. Memphis Mayor Paul Young defended the company, saying only 15 were actually running and that the rest were for backup.\nBut in late April, environmental groups sent a plane with thermal cameras to fly over the facility and found 33 turbines giving off significant amounts of heat \u2014 a sign they were also generating electricity and pollution.\n\u201cThe way they have come into the city, it\u2019s like, oh, you think we are unintelligent, you think that the people in these communities aren\u2019t able to comprehend what you are doing and will take this assault on our health lying down,\u201d 15-year-old Boxtown resident Jasmine Bernard said.\nYoung did not respond to an interview request.\nLynn, the environmental consultant listed on xAI\u2019s permit application, also didn\u2019t respond to emails and phone calls for comment. He did speak at a webinar hosted by the Chamber of Commerce in late April to answer community concerns about the turbines. Lynn didn\u2019t disclose his connection to xAI during the webinar and was introduced as only \u201can expert \u2026 who brings decades of experience on environmental compliance issues.\u201d\nIn the webinar, Lynn said xAI did not need air permits for 35 turbines already onsite because \u201cthere\u2019s rules that say temporary sources can be in place for up to 364 days a year. They are not subject to permitting requirements.\u201d\nIf a permit is approved, only seven of the current turbines will remain onsite, and they will be \u201cretrofitted\u201d with selective catalytic reduction pollution controls that will limit NOx pollution to 2 parts per million. By contrast, that make and model of turbine emits NOx at a rate of 9 parts per million, while emissions from other models of turbines onsite can be as high as 25 parts per million, according to their manufacturers. Another eight turbines, also with pollution controls, will be brought in.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re filing a permit because you have to have a permit for a stationary source,\u201d Lynn said.\nThe other 28 turbines currently onsite are \u201ctemporary,\u201d he said, and will be \u201cslowly\u201d moved out as xAI completes work building two substations. But the timeline for that is unclear, because only one of the substations has received the required approval of the TVA board. Townsend, the Chamber of Commerce president, said he doesn\u2019t know what xAI\u2019s timeline is.\n\u2018How does the county know?\u2019\nThe SELC says xAI\u2019s turbines are too large to take advantage of the temporary permitting loophole and should be regulated as stationary sources of pollution, even if they are technically portable. John Walke, a former attorney in EPA\u2019s Office of General Counsel who now works for the Natural Resources Defense Counsel, agrees that all the turbines require stationary source permits.\n\u201cXAI\u2019s position is quite suspect \u2014 I mean, they\u2019re huge,\u201d he said. \u201cThe temporary or not temporary argument is irrelevant.\u201d\nNeither Walke nor Buckheit, the former EPA enforcement official, is involved in the case. Buckheit says that at a minimum, the seven turbines that will remain onsite should have had a permit before they were running. The Health Department, he said, should have asked for proof upfront that xAI\u2019s turbines would be removed within a year before accepting the company\u2019s position that they were temporary.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been many months. Unless they are going to be shutting them down soon, they will have violated the law,\u201d he said. \u201cHow does the county know that they are going to be done within a year? Does the county care?\u201d\nIt\u2019s not clear what steps Shelby County took in determining that the turbines didn\u2019t require permits or when that decision was made.\nTownsend maintained the Health Department \u201cwas involved from day one.\u201d Taylor, the Health Department director, declined an interview request but has publicly implied she was also left in the dark.\nAt the April permit hearing, Taylor said her office became aware of the turbines when the SELC asked for a copy of the air permit. She said she wanted to \u201cremind everybody in this room\u201d to \u201cengage the Shelby Health Department early regarding new projects so that we can look into what the environmental impacts will be.\u201d\n\u201cIf we do not know if something is coming, we cannot do that research,\u201d she said. \u201cShelby County Health Department cannot assist with projects it is not aware of at the inception.\u201d\n\u2018All very important to President Trump\u2019\nEPA\u2019s role is also unclear.\nThe Health Department had a brief consultation with EPA in early August on the matter, during which the Health Department says the federal regulator agreed with the decision not to require a permit for the turbines.\nBut last November, EPA Region 4 Air and Radiation Director Denisse Diaz wrote to Taylor saying that although the agency\u2019s understanding was \u201cthe turbines are expected to cease operations in the next few months,\u201d it would conduct a more formal review process to confirm. She also suggested the county set up air monitoring to confirm emissions from the turbines. That hasn\u2019t happened.\n\u201cThe EPA will need more specific information about the generator units operating at the xAI site,\u201d says the letter obtained by E&E News.\nThe letter was sent just days before the presidential election.\nEPA spokesperson Molly Vaseliou said the agency is reviewing a \u201crequest for assistance\u201d from Shelby County.\nSince taking office in January, the Trump administration has made efforts to boost the nation\u2019s burgeoning artificial intelligence industry. Vaseliou said her agency is \u201ceager to work with AI leaders as it begins work to streamline permitting and regulations that will help accelerate American data center development.\u201d\nShe added that EPA \u201clooks forward to working with AI leaders\u201d as it begins to roll back some 31 pollution-limiting regulations announced in March. EPA has also billed its move to relax pollution rules limiting how long reciprocating internal combustion engines can run without a permit as one to help boost AI. The engines are commonly used to power pumps and compressors in power and manufacturing plants, often during emergency events. New EPA guidance would allow some of those engines to operate for up to 50 hours per year outside of emergencies in a move it is billing as \u201cthe first and certainly not the last step\u201d to ensuring data centers and utilities have reliable power.\nEPA Administrator Lee Zeldin himself vowed to support AI while \u201cunleashing American energy dominance\u201d in an appearance on Fox News shortly after the massive rollback was announced.\n\u201cThese are all very important to President Trump, so they are important to me,\u201d he said.\nXAI\u2019s Mayo reposted a clip of the interview on X, adding, \u201cPreach.\u201d\nPowering the recent surge of data centers has become a struggle for utilities nationwide due to supercomputers\u2019 massive energy requirements and related strain on the electric grid.\nMost utilities typically offer electricity to commercial users at discount rates in recognition of their high demand and the economic impact industrial users can have on a community. But data centers have a voracious appetite for power and create comparatively few jobs, leading some utilities to consider higher rates for \u201chyper users.\u201d\nThat includes the TVA board, which was planning to consider new rates for data centers, including xAI, at its May board meeting. But the board can no longer approve resolutions after President Donald Trump fired two of its members. Consideration of the data center measure has been postponed, TVA spokesperson Scott Brooks said.\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe proliferation of data centers has also contributed to a gas turbine shortage, as utilities look to build up power generation to serve the supercomputers and as other companies, like xAI, turn to producing their own electricity.\nXAI\u2019s demand for power has only grown since it came to Memphis last June. After months of tests, Colossus came fully online in September. That same day, Musk posted on X that it would double the number of computer chips onsite to 200,000 \u201cin a few months.\u201d\nHe has said Colossus will require 2,000 MW to power its expansion. So far, TVA has only approved xAI\u2019s initial request for 150 MW. The 15 turbines it wants permitted produce only 420 more. In October, xAI asked Memphis Light, Gas and Water to study the possibility of supplying an additional 260 MW through a new substation on another swath of land xAI recently leased in South Memphis, but the substation can\u2019t be built until TVA approves sending electricity to it, which could take months.\n\u201cIt will be the most powerful training cluster in the world,\u201d Musk said of the expansion in February while announcing the latest iteration of Grok. \u201cWe are not stopping here.\u201d\n\u2018Our lungs \u2026 on the auction block\u2019\nFor residents of Boxtown and South Memphis, xAI\u2019s arrival was a setback after a series of recent environmental victories.\nTwo years ago, local opposition stopped a planned 50-mile oil pipeline planned to run from a South Memphis Valero refinery through and around neighborhoods like Boxtown.

Vice President JD Vance urged Senate Republicans during a private lunch meeting Tuesday to send the final package to the president's desk.\n\u201cWe're excited to get this bill out,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader John Thune afterward.\nTuesday\u2019s report uses dynamic analysis by estimating the budgetary impact of the tax bill by considering how changes in the economy might affect revenues and spending. This is in contrast to static scoring, which presumes all other economic factors stay constant.\nThe CBO released its static scoring analysis earlier this month, estimating that Trump\u2019s bill would unleash trillions in tax cuts and slash spending, but also increase deficits by $2.4 trillion over the decade and leave some 10.9 million more people without health insurance.\nRepublicans have repeatedly argued that a more dynamic scoring model would more accurately show how cutting taxes would spur economic growth \u2014 essentially overcoming any lost revenue to the federal government.\nBut the larger deficit numbers in the new analysis gave Democrats, who are unified against the big bill, fresh arguments for challenging the GOP position that the tax cuts would essentially pay for themselves.\n\u201cThe Republican claim that this bill does not add to the debt or deficit is laughable, and the proof is in the numbers,\" said Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee.\n\u201cThe cost of these tax giveaways for billionaires, even when considering economic growth, will add even more to the debt than we previously expected,\u201d he said.\nMarc Goldwein, senior vice president and senior policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said Tuesday on social media that considering the new dynamic analysis, \u201cIt\u2019s not only not paying for all of itself, it\u2019s not paying for any of itself.\u201d\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent and other Republicans have sought to discredit the CBO, saying the organization isn\u2019t giving enough credit to the economic growth the bill will create.\nAt the Capitol, Mehmet Oz, who heads up the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services and joined Vance at the GOP Senate lunch, challenged CBO's findings when asked about its estimate that the bill would leave 10.9 million more people without health care, largely from new work requirements.\n\u201cWhat will an American do if they\u2019re given the option of trying to get a job or an education or volunteering their community \u2014 having some engagement \u2014 or losing their Medicaid insurance coverage?\u201d Oz asked. \u201cI have more confidence in the American people than has been given to them by some of these analyzing organizations.\u201d\nRepublicans on the Senate Finance Committee unveiled their proposal Monday for deeper Medicaid cuts, including new work requirements for parents of teens, as a way to offset the costs of making Trump\u2019s tax breaks more permanent in their draft for the big bill.\nThe Senate's version of the package also enhances Trump\u2019s proposed new tax break for seniors, with a bigger $6,000 deduction for low- to moderate-income senior households earning no more than $75,000 a year for singles, $150,000 for couples.\nThe proposals from Senate Republicans keep in place the current $10,000 deduction of state and local taxes, called SALT, drawing quick blowback from GOP lawmakers from New York and other high-tax states, who fought for a $40,000 cap in the House-passed bill. Senators insisted negotiations continue.\nBessent said Tuesday that the Senate Republican proposal for the tax cuts bill \u201cwill deliver the permanence and certainty both individual taxpayers and businesses alike are looking for, driving growth and unleashing the American economy.\u201d\n\u201cWe look forward to continuing to work with the Senate and the House to further refine this bill and get it to President Trump\u2019s desk,\u201d he said in a news release.\nWhile the House-passed bill exempted parents with dependents from the new Medicaid work requirements, the Senate\u2019s version broadened the requirement to include parents of children older than 14, as part of their effort to combat waste in the program and push personal responsibility.\nThe work requirements \u201cdemonstrate that you are trying your hardest to help this country be greater,\u201d Oz said. \u201cBy doing that, you earn the right to be on Medicaid.\u201d\nThe CBO separately released another analysis on the tax bill last week, including a look at how the measure would affect households based on income distribution. It estimates the bill would cost the poorest Americans roughly $1,600 a year while increasing the income of the wealthiest households by an average of $12,000 annually.", "Trump-backed giant tax and spending bill bloats deficit by $2.4T, nonpartisan audit finds. 11:42\nrepublished\nTrump-backed giant tax and spending bill bloats deficit by $2.4T, nonpartisan audit finds\nThe U.S. Capitol on Oct. 9, 2024. (Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released detailed analysis Wednesday showing Republicans\u2019 \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d would increase federal deficits by $2.4 trillion during the next decade.\nCBO projects that if enacted as written, the legislation would result in 10.9 million people losing access to health insurance by 2034, a number that includes \u201c1.4 million people without verified citizenship, nationality, or satisfactory immigration status who would no longer be covered in state-only funded programs in 2034.\u201d\nThe score is the most up-to-date analysis by Congress\u2019 official scorekeeper on how the sweeping tax and spending cuts package the House approved last month will impact the federal budget in the years ahead.\nRepublicans have been highly critical of the CBO\u2019s assessment of the legislation\u2019s real-world impacts, arguing that keeping tax rates as they are now, instead of letting them rise at the end of the year when the 2017 GOP tax law expires, will boost economic growth.\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., lambasted the CBO during a press conference shortly after the report came out, arguing its economic growth projections haven\u2019t been completely accurate.\n\u201cThis bill will actually reduce the deficit, if you recognize the historical economic growth that has always been there,\u201d Scalise said. \u201cTo say you\u2019re going to get 1.8% growth. At a minimum, we think you can get 2.5 to 4% growth. Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, says over 4% economic growth. So I get that we\u2019ve got to play by the rules of the referee, but the referee has been wrong.\u201d\nDuring the last decade, U.S. growth only surpassed 3% during one year, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.\nGross domestic product growth measured 2.5% in 2014, 2.9% in 2015, 1.8% in 2016, 2.5% in 2017, 3% in 2018, 2.6% in 2019, -2.2% in 2020 during the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, 6.1% in 2021, 2.5% in 2022, 2.9% in 2023 and 2.8% in 2024.\nWhite House budget director Russ Vought posted on social media that the CBO score \u201cconfirms what we knew about the bill at House passage.\u201d\n\u201cThe bill REDUCES deficits by $1.4 trillion over ten years when you adjust for CBO\u2019s one big gimmick\u2013not using a realistic current policy baseline,\u201d Vought wrote. \u201cIt includes $1.7 trillion in mandatory savings, the most in history. If you care about deficits and debt, this bill dramatically improves the fiscal picture.\u201d\nDisagreement over the \u2018big beautiful bill\u2019\nGOP lawmakers have also sought to brush aside criticism from some of their own members, including Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, who both argue the legislation must cut spending more to reduce the federal deficit in the long run.\nBillionaire and former Trump administration staffer Elon Musk has also become increasingly vocal about his opposition to the package, writing on social media this week that the \u201cmassive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination.\u201d\nThe House voted mostly along party lines in May to send the sweeping spending and tax cuts package to the Senate, which is expected to debate and amend the legislation in the weeks ahead.\nCBO\u2019s analysis will likely inform some of that conversation, and help senators better understand how the policy changes proposed by their House colleagues would affect state government budgets and the communities they represent.\nThe CBO previously shared analysis of each of the 11 bills that make up the package, but those didn\u2019t reflect several changes GOP House leaders made just hours before the floor vote in that chamber.\nUpdated numbers\nThe updated projections show Republicans\u2019 plan to extend the 2017 tax law and make other tweaks to tax policy would increase the deficit by $3.754 trillion during the next decade. That increase to the deficit caused by the tax changes, which CBO has also found would decrease resources for low-income families over the next decade while increasing resources for top earners, would be partly offset by spending reductions on certain programs.\nThe Armed Services Committee\u2019s bill would increase deficits by $144 billion, more than the $100 billion ceiling Republicans envisioned in the budget outline that was supposed to set guardrails on the package. Homeland Security\u2019s provisions would increase deficits by $79 billion. And the Judiciary Committee\u2019s language would increase deficits by $9 billion during the 10-year budget window.\nThe section of the package drafted by the Energy and Commerce Committee, which would make substantial changes to Medicaid and several other programs within the panel\u2019s jurisdiction, would decrease spending by $1.086 trillion during the 10-year budget window.\nThe panel\u2019s bill has four subcategories: energy, environment, communications and health. The health provisions, which include substantial changes to Medicaid, would reduce federal spending by $902 billion between 2025 and 2034.\nLanguage barring Medicaid from covering gender transition procedures for anyone in the state-federal health program would reduce federal spending by $2.6 billion during the next decade.\nRequiring some people on Medicaid to work, participate in community service or attend educational programs for at least 80 hours a month would reduce federal spending by $344 billion during the next 10 years.\nBlocking any Medicaid funding from going to Planned Parenthood would cut federal costs by $261 million during the 10-year budget window. Federal law already bars health care programs like Medicaid from covering abortions unless the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, or it endangers the life of the woman.\nSeparate analysis from CBO, released later Wednesday, projects that 7.8 million people would lose access to Medicaid because of the policy changes laid out in the House GOP bill. Another 2.3 million would lose access to health insurance due to changes to tax policy and 1.3 million people would no longer be able to purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace.\nCBO estimates that about 500,000 people would be impacted by interactions among the various health care policy changes. That number, subtracted from the numbers of those who would lose access, leads to a total of 10.9 million people losing access to health insurance by 2034.\nDemocratic criticism\nEnergy and Commerce Committee ranking member Frank Pallone Jr., a New Jersey Democrat, wrote in a statement that it\u2019s \u201cshocking House Republicans rushed to vote on this bill without an accounting from CBO on the millions of people who will lose their health care or the trillions of dollars it would add to the national (deficit).\n\u201cThe truth is Republican leaders raced to pass this bill under cover of night because they didn\u2019t want the American people or even their own members to know about its catastrophic consequences.\u201d\nThe Agriculture Committee\u2019s provisions, including pushing off some of the cost of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to states, would reduce federal spending by $238 billion during the next decade.\nThe Education and Workforce Committee\u2019s language would decrease federal spending by $349 billion. The Financial Services section of the package would reduce federal spending by $5 billion. Natural Resources would lower spending by $18 billion. And Transportation and Infrastructure would reduce spending by nearly $37 billion.\nThe Oversight and Government Reform bill would decrease spending by $12 billion, significantly less than the minimum of $50 billion the panel was supposed to cut under the reconciliation instructions included in the budget resolution.\nAriana Figueroa contributed to this report.\nLast updated 2:24 p.m., Jun. 4, 2025\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

The company argues the Republican president illegally imposed tariffs under an emergency powers law rather than getting approval from Congress.\nWhile the company won an early victory in a lower court, the order is on hold as an appeals court considers a similar ruling putting a broader block on Trump\u2019s tariffs. The appeals court has allowed Trump to continue collecting tariffs under the emergency powers law ahead of arguments set for late July.\nThe company argued in court documents the case can\u2019t wait that long, \u201cin light of the tariffs\u2019 massive impact on virtually every business and consumer across the Nation, and the unremitting whiplash caused by the unfettered tariffing power the President claims.\u201d\nThe Supreme Court is typically reluctant to take up cases before appeals courts have decided them, lowering the odds that the justices will agree to hear it as quickly as the company is asking.\nStill, Learning Resources CEO Rick Woldenberg said tariffs and uncertainty are taking a major toll now. He\u2019s looking ahead to the back-to-school and holiday seasons, when the company usually makes most of its sales for the year.\n\u201cAll the people that are raising their prices are doing it with a sense of dread,\u201d Woldenberg told The Associated Press.

We absolutely do not have a choice.\u201d\nAttorneys for Learning Resources and sister company hand2mind, suggested the court could consider whether to take up the case before the end of the term in June and hear arguments when their next term begins in the fall, a relatively quick timetable.\nThe Trump administration has defended the tariffs by arguing that the emergency powers law gives the president the authority to regulate imports during national emergencies and that the country\u2019s longtime trade deficit qualifies as a national emergency.\nTrump has framed tariffs as a tool to lure factories back to America, raise money for the Treasury Department and strike more favorable trade agreements with other countries.\n\u201cThe Trump administration is legally using the powers granted to the executive branch by the Constitution and Congress to address our country\u2019s national emergencies of persistent goods trade deficits and drug trafficking.

Two federal courts found Trump\u2019s use of an emergency law to justify tariffs unlawful, but neither ruling is currently in effect.\nIn response to a lawsuit filed by two education businesses, Contreras on Thursday invalidated Trump\u2019s reciprocal \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs and those he recently imposed on China that cited fentanyl trafficking.\nThe ruling landed hours after the U.S. Court of International Trade blocked those tariffs and ones Trump imposed on Canada and Mexico. That ruling came in response to suits filed by another group of businesses and a coalition of Democratic-led states.\nThe Trump administration quickly brought the legal battle to the appeals courts and asked to immediately halt the injunctions, warning that allowing them to take effect would curtail Trump\u2019s leverage to make trade deals with other countries.\nThe two appeals are taking place in separate courts.\nIn the case decided by the trade court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit quickly agreed to pause the ruling until the next stage of the appeal.\nContreras\u2019s ruling heads to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which has not yet intervened. But noting the Federal Circuit\u2019s pause, Contreras went ahead and put his decision on hold indefinitely.\n\u201cThe Court acknowledged the national security and foreign policy concerns raised by Defendants but determined that those consequences would flow, if at all, from the\u201d trade court\u2019s order, Contreras wrote.\n\u201cThat order has now been stayed by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. A stay in this action is therefore appropriate to protect the President\u2019s ability to identify and respond to threats to the U.S. economy and national security,\u201d Contreras, an appointee of former President Obama, continued.\nThe cases are just some of the legal challenges to Trump\u2019s tariffs.\nBut federal judges in California, Montana and Florida have declined to consider other lawsuits filed in their courts, telling plaintiffs they instead need to bring their case before the trade court.\nU.S. District Judge Jacqueline Corley, an appointee of former President Biden who serves in San Francisco, did so on Tuesday and dismissed a lawsuit filed by California and Gov. Gavin Newsom (D).\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

Hogg declines to run again for DNC vice chair after new election is called\nThe 25-year-old activist said he will devote his efforts to Leaders We Deserve.\nDavid Hogg will not run again for his Democratic National Committee vice chairman position, he announced on Tuesday, amid a firestorm the 25-year-old activist sparked over his pledge to take on \u201cineffective\u201d Democratic incumbents.\nDNC members removed Hogg and Pennsylvania state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta through a virtual vote on Wednesday night, stemming from a procedural complaint unrelated to Hogg\u2019s primary activities.\nIn a statement, Hogg said \u201cthere is a fundamental disagreement about the role of a Vice Chair \u2014 and it\u2019s okay to have disagreements.\u201d But, Hogg continued, \u201cwhat isn\u2019t okay is allowing this to remain our focus when there is so much more we need to be focused on.\u201d\nHogg said he would now focus his efforts on Leaders We Deserve, the group he co-founded, which said it would take on \u201casleep-at-the-wheel\u201d Democrats by pledging to spend $20 million on safe-seat Democratic primaries. Hogg\u2019s plan, announced in April, triggered a wave of anger from elected officials and DNC members, who argued that Hogg\u2019s role as a party leader conflicted with the decision to take on incumbents.\nDNC Chair Ken Martin, who clashed with Hogg, released a statement, \u201ccommend[ing] David for his years of activism, organizing, and fighting for his generation, and while I continue to believe he is a powerful voice for this party, I respect his decision to step back from his post as Vice Chair. I have no doubt that he will remain an important advocate for Democrats across the map. I appreciate his service as an officer, his hard work, and his dedication to the party.\u201d\nThe DNC will hold new elections for the two vice chair roles beginning Thursday \u2014 the vote for the new male vice chair will take place from June 12 to June 14 and then vote for a second vice chair of any gender from June 15 to June 17. With Hogg declining to run, Kenyatta is now running unopposed for the male vice chair role.\nThree other candidates for DNC vice chair \u2014 Shasti Conrad, Kalyn Free and Jeanna Repass \u2014 submitted candidate videos to compete for the second vacancy, according to one DNC member granted anonymity to describe private details.\nEarlier this week, Hogg\u2019s group endorsed Virginia state Del. Irene Shin in the special election for Virginia\u2019s 11th District to replace Democratic Rep. Gerry Connelly, who died last month.\nThe internal drama within the DNC reignited again over the weekend, when POLITICO obtained audio from a DNC meeting in which Martin told Hogg and other DNC leaders that his leadership has suffered due to the clash. The vice chair, Martin said, had \u201cessentially destroyed any chance I have\u201d to show national leadership. Several of the DNC leaders who participated in the call expressed support for Martin and accused Hogg or his supporters of leaking it. Hogg, for his part, denied he shared it.", "David Hogg will not run for DNC post again after party orders redo of vice chair elections. Progressive activist David Hogg said he won\u2019t seek to continue as a vice chair of the Democratic National Committee after the DNC called for a redo of the February election that elevated him to the post.\nShortly after the DNC announced it would hold new elections Thursday for two vice chair positions held by Hogg and Pennsylvania state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta as a result of a procedural challenge, Hogg announced he wouldn\u2019t be a candidate.\nThe decision comes amid a public spat with the DNC and its chairman, Ken Martin, over Hogg\u2019s decision to support primary challenges to Democratic incumbents, a spat that loomed over the vote even though it wasn\u2019t directly related to the challenge that ultimately led the party to call for a new election.\nHogg made the announcement in a lengthy statement that criticized the Democratic Party for a lack of vision and a refusal to pass the torch to the next generation. But his discussion about the DNC and the vice chairmanship specifically was more muted.\n\"I came into this role to play a positive role in creating the change our party needs. It is clear that there is a fundamental disagreement about the role of a Vice Chair \u2014 and it\u2019s okay to have disagreements. What isn\u2019t okay is allowing this to remain our focus when there is so much more we need to be focused on,\" he said in the statement.\n\"Ultimately, I have decided to not run in this upcoming election so the party can focus on what really matters. I need to do this work with Leaders We Deserve, and it is going to remain my number one mission to build the strongest party possible.\"\nMartin praised Hogg's for the party in a brief statement, saying, \"I appreciate his service as an officer, his hard work, and his dedication to the party.\u201d\n\u201cI commend David for his years of activism, organizing, and fighting for his generation, and while I continue to believe he is a powerful voice for this party, I respect his decision to step back from his post as Vice Chair. I have no doubt that he will remain an important advocate for Democrats across the map,\" Martin said.\nFollow live politics coverage here\nThe DNC had voted hours earlier to accept a recommendation from its Credentials Committee that the party hold two new vice chair elections because it found the DNC mistakenly created an advantage for the two male candidates, Hogg and Kenyatta, as it managed the internal elections at the end of a marathon February party meeting in Washington.\nOn Wednesday evening, the DNC announced that 75% of the votes its members cast in a virtual election were in favor of the recommendation, a vote of 294-99. It said 89% of its members participated in the virtual election.\nBecause DNC rules require equal gender representation on its executive committee, not including the party chair, the results of elections in February meant the DNC had to elect at least one man to its final two vice chair slots. But instead of holding individual votes for each position, one to be filled by a man and one by a candidate of any gender, the party decided to hold one vote to decide who took the final two slots.\nOklahoma Democratic Committeewoman Kalyn Free, who unsuccessfully ran against Hogg and Kenyatta in February, petitioned the DNC for a redo, claiming the decision to combine the ballots unfairly benefited Hogg and Kenyatta over the female candidates who were eligible for the final vice chair slot.\nThough Free\u2019s challenge was filed well before Hogg\u2019s public spat with Martin, Hogg framed the decision last month as proof that the party was trying to strip him of his title over his support for primary challenges to Democratic incumbents. Martin and Kenyatta vehemently disagreed with his framing: Martin blamed a \u201cprocedural error\u201d from \u201cbefore I became chair\u201d for the episode, and Kenyatta criticized Hogg for distracting from the party\u2019s work by arguing the vote amounted to personal retribution.\nAfter the new election was called, Kenyatta said in a statement that \u201cnow we can almost bring this chapter to a close,\u201d adding that he looked forward to \u201cmaking my case to DNC members and our party as a whole\u201d in the snap election.\n\u201cWe need a strong Democratic Party and I hope we come out of this stronger and focused on the work ahead,\u201d he said.\nWith Hogg's decision to step aside, Kenyatta is assured of winning his vice chair position back by the end of the week. The party will effectively be replacing Hogg with the winner of a subsequent vice chair election among the three candidates who were on the final ballot in February.\nTensions between Hogg and the party have been brewing for months, since he telegraphed his decision to back Democratic primary challenges through a political group he started, Leaders We Deserve. Hogg, who rose to prominence as a political activist after he was one of the victims of the 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Florida, argued in his statement Wednesday night that his mission to push the Democratic Party toward \"a new vision for the future and leaders to bring us there\" was most important to him, as he accused Democrats of thinking too small.\n\"After seeing a serious lack of vision from Democratic leaders, too many of them asleep at the wheel, and Democrats dying in office that have helped to hand Republicans an expanded majority, it became clear that Leaders We Deserve had to start primarying incumbents and directly challenging the culture of seniority politics that brought our party to this place to help get our party into fighting shape again,\" he said.\nAhead of the vote, Politico published a short clip of an internal Democratic Party call on which Martin vented his frustration with Hogg, saying the fight has \u201cessentially destroyed any chance I have to show the leadership that I need to.\u201d\nThe leak prompted another round of finger-pointing, with prominent DNC members accusing Hogg or his allies of orchestrating it. Hogg vehemently denied that and published a screenshot that he said showed his text messages with the reporter who published the story.\nEven if Hogg had decided to run again and won his seat back, Martin has said he would propose a neutrality pledge for officers that could have forced Hogg to choose between his party role and his role with the outside group he founded.", "Hogg forgoes reelection for DNC vice chair.

Or you may simply want to be rewarded with a preferential interest rate as acknowledgement for good credit history and responsible debt management. Whatever your goals or motivation, zero percent or low interest credit cards can help you maintain the lowest rates available to individuals with excellent to good credit.\nKeep in mind that there are two main categories of low rate credit cards, namely those that offer a Variable APR and those that give you a Fixed APR. Just like with variable versus fixed rate mortgages, a fixed rate APR will remain relatively stable through the course of the loan. If your card company decides to raise it \u2013 which is somewhat rare \u2013 they will first notify you of that change according to Federal law requirements. With a variable rate, your APR is tied to a prevailing rate such as the Prime Interest Rate. If the prime rate increases then your APR will most likely follow in a similar fashion.\nGenerally speaking, credit card companies and banks will extend either 6 or 21 month offers \u2013 within the 0% to 3.99% annual interest rate range. That can generate a considerable discount when normal APRs are averaging around 15% or higher. Once the introductory promotional period expires, the APR on a low interest credit card or interest free credit card may revert to the regular interest rate. Of course the ideal balance is a credit card that offers a great near term rate followed by an attractive, competitively priced low interest rate for the long term.\nThe interest rate charged on your credit card is widely regarded as the single most important component of your card. That\u2019s because it determines the major cost for you to borrow or roll over balances and pay them off over time instead of all at once or within the same month that you make purchases. That\u2019s why getting a zero percent or low interest credit card can be huge financial boon, no matter what your credit card usage patterns or money management strategies may be.\nCredit scores ranges may vary. Your individual chance at approval may vary due to factors such as creditors using a particular variation at their discretion.\nCompareCards' Parent Company\nAt CompareCards.com, our mission is to help people make more informed financial decisions each and every day.

Trump curbs immigration enforcement at farms, meatpacking plants, hotels and restaurants\nThe Trump administration has directed immigration officers to pause arrests at farms, restaurants and hotels after President Donald Trump expressed alarm about the impact of aggressive enforcement\nWASHINGTON -- The Trump administration directed immigration officers to pause arrests at farms, restaurants and hotels, after President Donald Trump expressed alarm about the impact of aggressive enforcement, an official said Saturday.\nThe move follows weeks of increased enforcement since Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff and main architect of Trump's immigration policies, said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers would target at least 3,000 arrests a day, up from about 650 a day during the first five months of Trump's second term.\nTatum King, an official with ICE's Homeland Security Investigations unit, wrote regional leaders on Thursday to halt investigations of the agricultural industry, including meatpackers, restaurants and hotels, according to The New York Times.\nA U.S. official who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed to The Associated Press the contents of the directive. The Homeland Security Department did not dispute it.\n\u201cWe will follow the President's direction and continue to work to get the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens off of America's streets,\u201d Tricia McLaughlin, a Homeland Security spokesperson, said when asked to confirm the directive.\nThe shift suggests Trump's promise of mass deportations has limits if it threatens industries that rely on workers in the country illegally. Trump posted on his Truth Social site Thursday that he disapproved of how farmers and hotels were being affected.\n\u201cOur great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn many cases the Criminals allowed into our Country by the VERY Stupid Biden Open Borders Policy are applying for those jobs. This is not good. We must protect our Farmers, but get the CRIMINALS OUT OF THE USA. Changes are coming!\u201d\nWhile ICE's presence in Los Angeles has captured public attention and prompted Trump to deploy the California National Guard and Marines, immigration authorities have also been a growing presence at farms and factories across the country.\nFarm bureaus in California say raids at packinghouses and fields are threatening businesses that supply much of the country\u2019s food. Dozens of farmworkers were arrested after uniformed agents fanned out on farms northwest of Los Angeles in Ventura County, which is known for growing strawberries, lemons and avocados. Others are skipping work as fear spreads.\nICE made more than 70 arrests Tuesday at a food packaging company in Omaha, Nebraska. The owner of Glenn Valley Foods said the company was enrolled in a voluntary program to verify workers' immigration status and that it was operating at 30% capacity as it scrambled to find replacements.\nTom Homan, the White House border czar, has repeatedly said ICE will send officers into communities and workplaces, particularly in \u201csanctuary\u201d jurisdictions that limit the agency's access to local jails.\nSanctuary cities \u201cwill get exactly what they don\u2019t want, more officers in the communities and more officers at the work sites,\u201d Homan said Monday on Fox News Channel. \u201cWe can\u2019t arrest them in the jail, we\u2019ll arrest them in the community. If we can\u2019t arrest them in community, we\u2019re going to increase work site enforcement operation. We\u2019re going to flood the zone.\u201d\n___", "Trump, in reversal, may exempt farms and hotels from immigration raids. President Donald Trump said on social media Thursday that he is willing to exempt the agriculture and hotel industries from his nationwide immigration crackdown. The surprise move came after executives in both industries complained to Trump about losing reliable, longtime immigrant workers in immigration raids and struggling to replace them.\n\u201cOur great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace,\u201d Trump wrote.\n\u201cIn many cases the Criminals allowed into our Country by the VERY Stupid Biden Open Borders Policy are applying for those jobs,\" he added. \"This is not good. We must protect our Farmers, but get the CRIMINALS OUT OF THE USA. Changes are coming!\u201d\nThe New York Times reported the next day that a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official had ordered a pause in immigration raids at agricultural businesses, meat packing plants, restaurants and hotels.\nThe senior ICE official also advised agents to stop arresting undocumented people who are not known to have committed crimes. Agents were told to continue to investigate and detain undocumented people with criminal backgrounds, according to the Times.\nIn response to a question from NBC News about Trump's pause, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin did not dispute it. \u201cWe will follow the president\u2019s direction and continue to work to get the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens off of America\u2019s streets,\" she said in a statement.\nAn immigration crossroads\nTrump faces a political crossroads. Immigration raids in Los Angeles sparked days of violent protests there and helped fuel sweeping anti-Trump protests nationwide Saturday.\nAt the same time, Trump repeatedly promised his supporters during the 2024 campaign that he would deport a million people a year, the largest mass deportations in U.S. history.\nTo meet that goal, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller demanded last month that ICE arrest at least 3,000 undocumented people a day.\nThree former DHS officials told NBC News that ICE officials will have to significantly increase raids of large workplaces nationwide to meet those goals. The sites include farms, meatpacking plants, hotels and restaurants \u2014 the industries Trump appears to have exempted.\nA former ICE official said that only raids on \u201cconstruction, dairy [and] meat processing facilities, carpet mills\u201d would result in the large number of detentions Miller has demanded. \u201cIt\u2019s these low-wage jobs, that is where you get the numbers,\u201d the former official said.\nDuring the 2024 campaign and since he returned to office, Trump has dismissed warnings from experts that such large-scale deportations would lead to worker shortages in the industries he is apparently exempting now.\nBut groups that support his crackdown expect him to keep his promise.\n\u201cThey should be going after them,\u201d said Ira Mehlman, a spokesperson for Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group that supports a crackdown on undocumented workers. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is going to be a huge swath of the country that will be upset if they bust these companies, if they are employing illegal immigrants and passing on the cost to everyone else.\u201d\nTargeting slaughterhouses\nFor years, slaughterhouses have been one of the industries best known for relying on newly arrived immigrant labor, in part because of the difficult and dangerous nature of the work. And many slaughterhouses are in red states scattered throughout the Midwest and the Southeast. Texas alone has almost 500 meat and food processing plants, according to Agriculture Department data.\nICE agents last week raided a locally owned slaughterhouse in Omaha, Nebraska, and arrested at least 80 undocumented workers, according to local officials. Chad Hartmann, a spokesperson for Glenn Valley Foods, said in a statement that federal agents searched the company\u2019s facility \u201cfor persons believed to be using fraudulent documents to gain employment.\u201d He said that the company strives to operate within the law, that it is cooperating with agents and that it \u201cis not being charged with any crime.\u201d\nBut so far ICE has not consistently targeted large slaughterhouses around the country.\nSince Trump took office in January, ICE\u2019s workplace enforcement raids appear to have largely targeted smaller businesses, such as a roofer in Bellingham, Washington; a Mexican restaurant in Harlingen, Texas; and a small equipment manufacturer in South Dakota. One of the largest workplace raids to date \u2014 which yielded more than 100 arrests \u2014 was at a construction site in Tallahassee overseen by a privately owned Florida-based construction company.\nLarry Stine, an employment attorney who represents some of the largest meatpacking plants in the Southeast, says his clients are \u201cterrified\u201d of a possible raid and have been actively auditing their employees\u2019 paperwork.\nFew construction industry raids\nTrump did not mention an exemption for the construction industry, which also employs large numbers of immigrant workers. So far, though, the construction industry has experienced relatively few ICE raids, industry officials said.\nBrian Turmail, vice president of public affairs for the Associated General Contractors of America, said that to date, he is aware of only sporadic reports of construction site raids, such as one in Tallahassee on May 29 when more than 100 allegedly undocumented people were detained.\nThe contractors\u2019 association continues to prepare members for how to respond if the pace of enforcement actions increases. \u201cWe\u2019ve been reposting compliance information now that it\u2019s a bit more real,\u201d Turmail said.\nTurmail said he remains confident that Trump is sensitive to the needs of the construction industry, whose decadeslong workforce shortage has only grown more acute in recent years. It\u2019s one reason construction costs have been surging, he said, which, in turn, has resulted in construction spending\u2019s declining year on year for the first time since 2019.\n\u201cBetween higher labor and higher material costs, it\u2019s putting developers on the sidelines because projects don\u2019t pencil out anymore,\u201d Turmail said.\nMembers of the contractors' association remain hopeful that the administration\u2019s promises to reorient more of the workforce toward vocational skills will turn into federal spending to do so.\nTurmail predicted that worker shortages will persist and most likely worsen if the immigration crackdown continues. One way the administration could help address them, he said, would be to create ways for construction workers to enter the country legally.\n\u201cEven if we got all the funding we wanted, we\u2019d still need to also find some temporary lawful pathways for people to come in and work in construction,\u201d he said.\nDemocrats say Trump\u2019s campaign promises of millions of mass deportations are hitting economic realities. John Sandweg, who was ICE director during the Obama administration, said that to maintain its 3,000 arrests per day quota, the Trump administration would have to raid factories owned by large corporations. \u201cNo doubt some Fortune 500 will get hit,\u201d he said.", "An Omaha food plant owner says he followed the rules for hiring immigrants. An Omaha food plant owner says he followed the rules for hiring immigrants\nThe owner of an Omaha food packaging company says his business has been unfairly hamstrung by Tuesday's raid carried out by federal immigration officials\nOMAHA, Neb. -- The owner of an Omaha food packaging company says his business has been unfairly hamstrung by federal immigration officials, who raided the plant and arrested more than half its workforce.\nThe raid took place despite the company meticulously following the government's own system for verifying the workers were in the country legally, owner Gary Rohwer said Wednesday.\nGlenn Valley Foods now is operating at about 30% of capacity as the business scrambles to hire more workers, Rohwer said as he stood outside the plant.\nAsked how upsetting the raid was, Rohwer replied, \u201cI was very upset, ma\u2019am, because we were told to e-verify, and we e-verified all these years, so I was shocked.\u201d\n\u201cWe did everything we could possibly do,\" he said.\nE-Verify is an online U.S. Department of Homeland Security system launched in the late 1990s that allows employers to quickly check if potential employees can work legally in the U.S., often by using Social Security numbers.\nSome of America\u2019s largest employers use it, including Starbucks and Walmart, but the vast majority of employers do not. Critics say the system is fairly easy to cheat, particularly with false documents.\nRohwer noted that federal officials have said his company was a victim of those using stolen identities or fake IDs to get around the E-Verify system, which lead agents conducting the raid described as \u201cbroken\u201d and \u201cflawed\u201d to Glenn Valley executives.\nBut that does nothing to repair the company\u2019s bottom line, Rohwer said.\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see the United States government ... come up with a program that they can communicate to the companies as to how to hire legitimate help. Period,\u201d he said.\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement confirmed that more than 70 people were arrested during the Glenn Valley Foods raid on Tuesday. It also said one of the workers, described as a Honduras national, assaulted federal agents as he was being detained.\nThe Omaha raid comes amid an immigration crackdown under President Donald Trump. The administration has been intensifying its efforts in recent weeks, and Trump deployed more than 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines this week to respond to ongoing protests in Los Angeles over his immigration policies.\nThe raid, in the southeastern section of Omaha where nearly a quarter of residents are foreign born according to the 2020 census, led to hundreds of people turning out to protest Tuesday evening. But it also had a chilling effect on the south Omaha community.\nThe Metropolitan Community College\u2019s South Omaha campus and an Omaha library branch in the area closed Tuesday afternoon, and several businesses along south Omaha's normally bustling 24th Street closed as news of the raid spread. Several of them remained closed Wednesday, said Douglas County Board of Commissioners Chairman Roger Garcia, whose district covers south Omaha.\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s still on alert, waiting to see what happens today and in the coming days,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cSo there\u2019s still a lot of anxiety and fear out there.\u201d\nThat fear will show up in the form of a weakened economy in Omaha, he added.\n\u201cYou know, when products are not being sold, taxes are not being collected, and people are not able to get their goods as well. So it affects all of us,\u201d he said.\nAn aunt of Garcia's wife was among those taken away by ICE during the Omaha raid, he said. They have been unable to determine where she is being held.\nThe raid came on the same day of the inauguration of newly elected Omaha Mayor John Ewing, a Democrat who unseated three-term Republican Jean Stothert last month.\nDuring a news conference Wednesday to address the raid, Ewing declined to speculate on whether the timing of it was intended to distract from his swearing-in. But he denounced the action by federal authorities, saying, \u201cMy message to the public is that we are with them.\u201d\nOmaha Police Chief Todd Schmaderer also declared that his department will play no part in checking immigration or the legal status of residents in the community.\n\u201cThat is not our mission. Our mission is public safety,\u201d the chief said. \u201cI need victims to come forward. They will not come forward if they\u2019re fearful of Omaha Police Department being immigration officers.\u201d"]}, {"topic": 56, "name": "Stablecoin Legislation & Trump Conflicts", "keywords": "crypto, stablecoin, bill, senate, vote, genius, stablecoins, legislation, cryptocurrency, act", "documents": ["Senate votes to end debate on stablecoin bill, teeing up final vote.

They\u2019re completely, totally absent.\u201d\nHowever, crypto-friendly Democrats who have been deeply involved in negotiations are urging their colleagues to support the bill despite some of its shortcomings.\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely unhelpful that we have a president who\u2019s involved in this industry, and I would love to ban this activity, but that does not diminish the excellent work of this legislation,\u201d Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) said Wednesday.\n\u201cIt does not diminish the hard work that bipartisan group of senators put into this to make a difference and to write a law that can protect consumers, that can protect our financial services industry, that can protect the strength of the dollar, and that can protect people who would like access to capital,\u201d she added.\nThe GENIUS Act likely faces a handful more votes before it can clear the Senate and head to the House. Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) told The Hill on Tuesday that she expects a final vote on the bill next week.\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

The Senate passed legislation on Tuesday that would regulate a form of cryptocurrency known as stablecoins, the first of what the industry hopes will be a wave of bills to bolster its legitimacy and reassure consumers.\nThe fast-moving legislation, which passed by a 68-30 vote and will be sent to the House for potential revisions, comes on the heels of a 2024 campaign cycle in which the crypto industry ranked among the top political spenders in the country, underscoring its growing influence in Washington and beyond.\nThe bill leaves unresolved concerns over presidential conflicts of interest \u2013 an issue that remains a source of tension within the Democratic caucus.\nEighteen Democratic senators crossed the aisle to vote for the legislation on Tuesday, siding with the Republican majority in the 53-47 Senate. The Republican senators Josh Hawley and Rand Paul were the only members of their party to oppose the measure.\nKnown as the Genius Act, the bill would establish guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency typically pegged to the US dollar. The acronym stands for \u201cGuiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins\u201d\nThe bill only needed a simple majority vote to pass on Tuesday, after it had already cleared its biggest procedural hurdle last week in a 68-30 vote, with 18 Democrats siding with Republicans. But the bill has faced more resistance than initially expected.\nIt was the second major bipartisan bill to advance through the Senate this year, following the Laken Riley Act on immigration enforcement in January. Still, most Democrats opposed the bill. They raised concerns that the measure does little to address Donald Trump\u2019s personal financial interests in the crypto space.\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t able to include certainly everything we would have wanted, but it was a good bipartisan effort,\u201d said Angela Alsobrooks, a Democratic senator from Maryland, on Monday. Alsobrooks, a co-sponsor of the bill, added, \u201cThis is an unregulated area that will now be regulated.\u201d\nThe stablecoin legislation still faces several hurdles before reaching the president\u2019s desk. It must clear the narrow Republican majority in the House, where lawmakers may try to attach a broader market structure bill \u2013 sweeping legislation that could make a second passage through the Senate more difficult. Trump has said he wants stablecoin legislation on his desk before Congress breaks for its August recess, now just under 50 days away.\nBill Hagerty, the bill\u2019s sponsor and a Republican senator from Tennessee, said on the Senate floor ahead of the vote: \u201cWith this bill, the United States is a step closer to being a global leader in crypto.\u201d\nA provision in the bill bans members of Congress and their families from profiting off stablecoins. That prohibition does not extend to the president and his family, even as Trump builds a crypto empire from the White House.\n\u201cPassing the Genius Act without strong anti-corruption measures stamps a congressional seal of approval on President Trump selling access to the government for personal profit,\u201d said Jeff Merkley, a Democratic senator from Oregon, in a statement after the bill\u2019s passage.\nElizabeth Warren, a Democratic senator from Massachusetts, has been among the most outspoken as the ranking member on the Senate banking committee, warning that the bill creates a \u201csuper highway\u201d for Trump corruption. She has also warned that the bill would allow major technology companies, such as Amazon and Meta, to launch their own stablecoins.\nLast month, the Republican president hosted a private dinner at his golf club in Virginia with top investors in a Trump-branded memecoin. His family holds a significant stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto project that launched its own stablecoin, USD1.\nTrump reported earning $57.35m from token sales at World Liberty Financial in 2024, according to a public financial disclosure released Friday. A memecoin linked to him has generated an estimated $320m in fees, though the earnings are split among multiple investors.\nAmong the Democrats who backed the bill was Elissa Slotkin, a first-term senator who received $10m in support from a crypto political action committee during her Michigan race last year. Slotkin acknowledged the bill \u201cwasn\u2019t perfect\u201d but called it a \u201cgood-faith, bipartisan start\u201d to regulating stablecoins.\nThe administration is broadly supportive of crypto\u2019s growth and its integration into the economy. Ahead of Tuesday\u2019s vote, Scott Bessent, the treasury secretary, urged the Senate to pass the bill, saying it could help stablecoins \u201cgrow into a $3.7tn market by the end of the decade\u201d."]}, {"topic": 57, "name": "Black History, Media, and DEI Backlash", "keywords": "juneteenth, church, film, black, celebrations, galveston, celebration, day, holiday, streaming", "documents": ["16 things to watch to educate yourself about systemic racism. - Juneteenth commemorates the emancipation of enslaved people in the US.\n- These 16 movies and shows are a good place to start to learn about systemic racism.\n- They include biopics like \"Judas and the Black Messiah\" and comedies like \"Sorry to Bother You.\"\nReading books and watching documentaries is a part of education, but fictional movies or dramatizations of real stories can be equally illuminating.\nThursday, June 19, is Juneteenth, which commemorates the emancipation of enslaved people in the US.

Prosecutors paired the testimony with video clips of Read where she talked about being inebriated behind the wheel and questioned whether she could have \u201cclipped\u201d O\u2019Keefe.\nMore in U.S.\nForensic scientists presented jurors with analysis of phone and vehicle data showing Read\u2019s SUV moving 87 feet in reverse at about the same time O\u2019Keefe\u2019s phone locked for the last time. They showed pictures of tiny red bits of plastic stuck in the fabric of O\u2019Keefe\u2019s sweatshirt, and pieces of Read\u2019s taillight near where his body was found.\nText messages between Read and O\u2019Keefe in the days and hours before his death revealed their privately fraying relationship, despite public shows of affection.\n\u201cTell me if you're interested in someone else, can\u2019t think of any other reason you are like this,\u201d Read wrote at one point. O\u2019Keefe replied: \u201cThings haven't been great between us for a while. Ever consider that?\u201d\nRead\u2019s defense team at every turn sought to sow doubt in the credibility of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses and the integrity of the investigation into O\u2019Keefe\u2019s death. They alleged that the lead detective in O\u2019Keefe\u2019s case, former Massachusetts State Trooper Michael Proctor, was biased against Read, citing crude text messages he sent to friends, and questioned whether he planted the pieces of taillight at the crime scene.\nOne defense expert suggested that O\u2019Keefe\u2019s injuries were caused by a dog, backing up the defense\u2019s theory that O\u2019Keefe was beaten inside the home of a fellow cop, attacked by his dog and discarded outside during a blizzard.\n(This story has been updated to add new information.)\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Karen Read found not guilty of second-degree murder charge", "Trauma-informed nurses help sexual assault survivors. Most hospitals don\u2019t have them.. 5:00\nNews Story\nTrauma-informed nurses help sexual assault survivors. Most hospitals don\u2019t have them.\nIllustration by Nolen Strals for the Gulf States Newsroom and Type Investigations\nThis story was produced in partnership with the Springboard Project at Type Investigations, with support from the Gertrude Blumenthal Kasbekar Fund.\nEditor\u2019s Note: This story contains descriptions of sexual assault which may be disturbing to some readers.\nJulie Ford doesn\u2019t remember everything about her assault. She remembers being tired as she neared the end of her usual jogging route atop the Mississippi River levee in New Orleans. She remembers passing someone sitting on a bench. She remembers being \u201ctackled like a football player.\u201d\nThe rest comes in flashes. Fighting him off. Dragging herself through the dirt. Calling for help. Her husband, bystanders, and EMTs carrying her broken body to the ambulance, which couldn\u2019t get to her on the river side of the levee.\nShe remembers pleading to be taken to West Jefferson Medical Center, a hospital she knew took her insurance. She didn\u2019t know it yet, but her hip had been dislocated, nose broken and her arm broken so badly EMTs described it as being in the shape of a question mark.\nBecause she\u2019d been assaulted, she remembers being told she had to be taken to a specific hospital to receive a forensic exam \u2014 sometimes called a \u201crape kit.\u201d While a range of clinicians can conduct forensic exams, specialized nurses called sexual assault nurse examiners (SANE) receive rigorous training to provide trauma-informed care throughout the evidence collection and examination process. SANEs also connect survivors with resources and advocates.\nSANEs and the advocates they connect survivors with are vital for trauma-informed patient care and for bringing perpetrators of sexual assault to justice. But there is a critical shortage of SANEs across the Gulf South. According to the International Association of Forensic Nurses, a trade group that certifies SANEs, Alabama has 44 certified SANEs for the entire state. Louisiana has 42. Mississippi only has 6 \u2014 for a population of almost three million.\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\nWhere and how sexual assault patients access this resource varies greatly across the region. Although Louisiana state law requires patients have access to forensic exams in every parish, in practice not every hospital is set up to provide them. Instead, sexual assault survivors are often funneled to specific hospitals with SANEs tasked with delivering this specialized care In the New Orleans area, one of those facilities is University Medical Center, the hospital where Ford said she was taken, even though it wasn\u2019t in her insurance network.\nWhat followed was another blur. She said she was put in a triage area that was \u201cvery public.\u201d There, a detective asked her the same questions she\u2019d already answered for patrol officers. She didn\u2019t know where her husband was or why her leg felt like it \u201cfell off.\u201d She said nobody would tell her what was happening.\nShe was confused and scared \u2014 until she was greeted by an advocate from Sexual Trauma Awareness and Response (STAR), a group that works with survivors, and a sexual assault nurse examiner.\nIt was the first time she felt that somebody was here to help her, she said. SANEs are trained to reach out to advocates to sit with patients like Ford while they conduct a forensic medical exam, collecting evidence that could be used in prosecution.\nIt would take almost a decade before Ford\u2019s attacker would be convicted for assaulting her. Patients can\u2019t be charged for forensic exams in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama under state law. In Louisiana, hospitals are reimbursed up to $1,600 for a forensic exam from the state\u2019s Crime Victims Reparations fund.\nBut this only covers the forensic exam \u2014 not the costs related to any additional injuries. Ford said for the one night she spent in the UMC emergency department, she was charged about $20,000 for medical care related to her severe injuries, which still haven\u2019t fully healed.\nFord said she and her husband spent months making phone calls to their insurance company, and, after tearfully recounting what happened to her over and over, eventually, they were able to get most of the bills to be considered in-network. She ended up paying more than $2,300 out of pocket for medical bills, as well as around $1,000 for the ambulance ride.\n\u201cThe only thing in the system that I think worked in my entire experience was that piece, the forensic medical exam and the advocate piece,\u201d Ford said. \u201cI felt very lucky to have that.\u201d\nAfter her assault, Ford stayed in touch with her advocate from STAR and used their hotline, support groups, and legal program for guidance and support. She\u2019s had two surgeries and years of physical therapy related to her injuries.\nShe\u2019s also become an advocate for other survivors. She now volunteers with Crime Survivors NOLA, which produces a free guidebook of resources for people dealing with the aftermath of violent crime. She said the practice of sending sexual assault survivors to another facility if they want a forensic exam is a huge barrier.\n\u201cIt might take a lot for that person to walk into a hospital, and you want to make it as easy as possible for them to get done what they need to get done,\u201d Ford said.\n\u201cJust telling somebody that they have to go somewhere else, that might be the difference between that report getting taken or not getting taken.\u201d\nSANE training\nWhen it comes time for her to introduce herself, nurse Gennie Cochran answers the icebreaker questions scrawled on the whiteboard like almost every other nurse in the small, brightly-lit room down the hall from the ICU at Ochsner Rush Medical Center in Meridian, Mississippi.\nShe\u2019s originally from Mississippi, but she worked at West Jefferson Medical Center in Louisiana \u2014 the hospital Ford begged paramedics to take her to \u2014 from 2016 up until February, when she moved to Ochsner Rush.\n\u201cI\u2019m always tired,\u201d she says with a laugh. The other nurses in the room nod in understanding.\nCochran and six other nurses and nurses-in-training from across the region are here for a week-long training to become SANEs. This is day one.\nThe last icebreaker question on the board is: Why am I taking this course?\n\u201cThis course is very near and dear to my heart,\u201d Cochran says, tearing up as she explains that her daughter was assaulted when she was 13. She says it changed her daughter\u2019s life and Cochran wants to be able to care for survivors. She wants to \u201cmake sure it\u2019s done right, so they can\u2019t throw it out in court.\u201d\nShalotta Sharp, one of the SANEs helping to run the training, thanks Cochran for sharing her experience. After a short break, the group reconvenes and Sharp poses a question.\n\u201cHow many of you learned about the SANE program or SANE nursing or forensic nursing in nursing school?\u201d Sharp asks.\nNo one, including Cochran raises their hand.\n\u201cMe either,\u201d Sharp says, cutting through the tension in the quiet room. \u201cForensic nursing is the best kept secret in the nursing community, in my opinion.\u201d\nMany of the nurses at the training came because the hospital where they work doesn\u2019t have a SANE. According to the International Association of Forensic Nurses, only 17-20% of American hospitals do. They want to be able to conduct forensic exams and provide trauma-informed care to their patients.\n\u201cI work in small hospitals,\u201d says nurse Jane Koen, who drove in for the SANE training from Choctaw County, Alabama. \u201cWe don\u2019t have that in our small counties, so I just wanted to try to do it.\u201d\nUnder the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, anyone who comes to an emergency room must receive an initial exam, called a medical screening, where they\u2019re checked for serious injuries and made sure they\u2019re stable. The law also guarantees emergency care to anyone, whether or not they have insurance or the ability to pay.\nBut Koen said that if sexual assault patients come ot the hospital where she works and want a forensic exam, they have to be transferred to another facility in Mississippi. It\u2019s about an hour\u2019s drive by car.\n\u201cWe tell them, \u2018We don\u2019t do that here,\u2019\u201d she said.\nGuns kill more U.S. children than other causes, but state policies can help, study finds\n\u2018A huge impediment\u2019\nIn interviews nurses, advocates, and legal experts from Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi, recounted instances where patients couldn\u2019t access forensic exams at their local hospital. Instead, they were transferred or referred elsewhere: sometimes across town, across the state, or across state lines. Sometimes, survivors drive themselves.\nExactly how often patients have to travel to receive this care isn\u2019t clear because transfers like these are not tracked in public data. In some parts of Louisiana, regional policy states hospitals can transfer patients to a facility where a SANE is available.\nNaomi Jones, a former prosecutor \u2014 who prosecuted survivor Julie Ford\u2019s case \u2014 in New Orleans, said having to travel to another hospital to get a forensic exam is a \u201chuge impediment.\u201d\nJones laid out a hypothetical timeline a survivor could face: they go out one evening around 7 or 8 p.m., an assault happens between 12 and 3 a.m., they make the decision to go to a hospital that doesn\u2019t have a SANE around 5 or 6 a.m., get their initial exam around 9 a.m., and are then told they need to go to another facility if they want a forensic exam. And it could be several hours later before the forensic exam begins, which can take as long as six hours to complete.\n\u201cAt this point, that person has been up and awake for well over 24 hours,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThey have been brutalized. They have already been prodded.\u201d\nWhen a patient is told they need to go to another facility, in Louisiana, there isn\u2019t a system in place that tracks whether or not they make it to that facility. Because this data isn\u2019t collected, there\u2019s no way to know how many sexual assault survivors choose not to go through with getting a forensic exam.\nUMC in New Orleans houses Louisiana\u2019s largest SANE unit and many surrounding parishes send patients there for forensic exams. If an assault occurs in neighboring St. John the Baptist Parish, for example, the patient could be sent to UMC \u2014 potentially over an hour away \u2014 to meet with a SANE.\nOne SANE at UMC, Heidi Tujague, said when a patient is transferred, she gets a phone call from another hospital saying to expect a patient for a forensic exam. She reaches for a sticky note and jots down their basic information.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had sticky notes with just a name and a birthday,\u201d Tujague said. After a week or so, if a patient doesn\u2019t come in, she has to throw the neon-colored squares away.\n\u2018Double-edged sword\u2019\nIn the 1970s, nurses across the U.S. came together, recognizing the need for specialized care for sexual assault patients, and started the first SANE programs with the aim of improving care for patients as well as the quality of evidence collection for prosecution.\nThe nurses who developed these programs likely did not envision a future where lack of access to a SANE could jeopardize medical care and legal recourse for survivors of sexual assault \u2014 a \u201cdouble-edged sword\u201d as SANE-trainer Shalotta Sharp called it.\nSharp said any nurse can conduct a forensic exam by using a SAFE kit. But this can pull a nurse off an emergency room floor for several hours. Many hospitals are already understaffed, and having fewer staff available can lead to increased wait times, higher rates of patients leaving the hospital without being seen and more medical errors.\nThe evidence may also not be as high-quality, and there\u2019s the risk of retraumatizing the patient if the nurse isn\u2019t specially trained to work with survivors of sexual assault. And, according to Sharp, many nurses are worried about having to testify in court if a case goes to trial.\nOn the first day of the SANE training in Meridian, Mississippi, Sharp explained that administering the SAFE kit was a small fraction of what they would learn.\n\u201cWhat you are going to be learning about is what this patient looks like, how to recognize this patient, how to talk to this patient, how to document the findings you see on this patient,\u201d Sharp said. \u201cHow to engage with this patient. How to listen. Listen to that patient and actually hear what is being said.\u201d\nAdvocates say this approach is critical for sexual assault survivors, many whom come into a hospital physically and emotionally injured, distrustful, and scared.\n\u201cYou\u2019re dealing with trauma,\u201d said Kimberly Young, who runs Hearts of Hope, a sexual assault resource center in Lafayette, Louisiana. \u201cYou need people like Shalotta [Sharp] in that room who are trauma-informed and know how to handle trauma.\u201d\nJencie Olivier, the sexual assault response center coordinator at Hearts of Hope, recently started keeping track of patients who said hospitals turned them away. Since January, she\u2019s recorded seven instances. \u201cThey\u2019re saying, \u2018We\u2019re not trained and able to do this\u2019 and \u2018Can you call Hearts of Hope?\u2019\u201d\nThose patients went to the Hearts of Hope facility, where they were able to meet with a SANE and get forensic exams.\nThe trauma-informed care SANEs provide also includes immediately contacting a local advocacy group to send someone to the hospital to sit with the patient, comfort them, advocate for them, explain the process, and connect them to any resources they might need, like support groups or legal assistance.\nThat\u2019s all if the patient wants it. Consent is another huge aspect of a forensic exam conducted by a SANE, who explains each step before they do it and asks the patient for their permission before proceeding. If a patient doesn\u2019t want to be swabbed or want photographs of certain areas, for instance, SANEs respect their choices.\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\nBetter legal outcomes\nJones, the prosecutor, says SANEs are better at what\u2019s called the \u201cchain of custody,\u201d which refers to the process by which evidence is properly collected and transported so it\u2019s not damaged or contaminated.\n\u201cChain of custody is incredibly important and [SANEs are] trained to do it and they\u2019re good at it,\u201d said Jones, the former prosecutor. \u201cAnd that helps preserve the evidence. And evidence finds the truth.\u201d\nJones said that when a prosecutor is making a decision about whether or not they\u2019re going to go forward with a sexual assault case, part of that process includes looking at whether or not there\u2019s enough evidence. \u201cIt absolutely makes for a stronger case against a defendant when you have medical evidence,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes a difference \u2014 a massive difference.\u201d\nResearch supports this as well. A 2018 report on sexual assault and the availability of forensic examiners from the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that forensic exams conducted by people trained to perform them \u201cmay result in better physical and mental health care for victims, better evidence collection, and higher prosecution rates.\u201d\nSimilarly, a 2006 study by the American Prosecutors Research Institute and Boston College found that involving a SANE or a sexual assault response team in a case could contribute to higher survivor participation in the legal process, increased suspect identification and arrests, and greater likelihood of conviction.\nSANEs don\u2019t just play a role on the evidentiary side of a sexual assault case. Because of their specialized training, they can also be qualified as experts and testify in court. Survivor Julie Ford said the testimony of the SANE that examined her was \u201ccompletely critical for the case.\u201d\nTraveling SANEs\nAnother reason why there aren\u2019t enough SANEs is that there aren\u2019t enough nurses. There\u2019s currently a shortage of working nurses in the U.S., driven by factors such as a reduction in nursing program enrollments and working conditions. Concerns about adequate pay and workplace safety have driven many nurses to leave the profession.\n\u201cWe have a national surplus of nurses, believe it or not. There are more than enough nurses,\u201d said Michelle Mahon with National Nurses United, the largest nursing union in the country. \u201cWhat is lacking is the nurses who are willing to work in the conditions of care that have been created by the industry.\u201d\nRather than transfer patients between facilities, some regional health districts in Louisiana have adopted a \u201ctraveling SANE\u201d model, where the specialized nurses come to the patients, when availability allows. For example, in Region 7, which encompasses nine parishes in the northwestern part of the state, if a patient presents to a hospital that doesn\u2019t have a SANE, the hospital will request one be sent to that facility to meet with them and conduct a forensic exam when and if the patient requests one. In instances where no SANE is available, an emergency department physician can perform the exam.\nMorgan Lamandre is president and CEO of Sexual Trauma Awareness and Response (STAR) \u2014 the organization that sent a volunteer to sit with survivor Julie Ford after her assault \u2014 which has offices in three different locations in Louisiana, one with a hospital-based SANE program at UMC and two with traveling SANE programs. She said removing the travel barrier increases the likelihood that a survivor will get a forensic exam.\n\u201cFrom our perspective, the model is the traveling program because it doesn\u2019t matter where a survivor presents to a hospital, the SANE comes to them,\u201d Lamandre said. \u201cWho knows how long it took them to get to the point of the hospital where they were being discharged to go to another hospital and to relive and tell a million people all over again what happened to them. Sometimes they just say it\u2019s not worth it.\u201d\nOther advocates agree that bringing SANEs to patients can help alleviate the barriers to accessing a forensic exam.\n\u201cWithout a doubt, whenever you have a survivor that\u2019s faced with an obstacle like that, they\u2019re less likely to get a forensic exam,\u201d said Rafael de Castro, executive director of the Louisiana Foundation Against Sexual Assault, a nonprofit that works with rape crisis centers in the state.\n\u201cWhenever you can break down obstacles for survivors to get the services that they need, you\u2019re always going to see an increase,\u201d de Castro said.\nDe Castro said this impact goes deeper than getting a forensic exam or medical care in the moment. SANEs connect survivors to local sexual assault centers and advocates who can provide long-term services like individual or group counseling, legal assistance, and other forms of support.\n\u201cIf a survivor doesn\u2019t know that those services are available,\u201d de Castro said, \u201cthen they don\u2019t get those services.\u201d Studies show sexual assault survivors are at a higher risk for suicide. \u201cIt\u2019s a life-lasting impact when those services are not there for a survivor.\u201d\n\u2018Compassion fatigue\u2019\nWhile they can benefit patients, traveling SANE programs can stretch thin the capacity of SANEs in the region they serve. Jefferson Parish only has two full-time traveling SANEs \u2014 which can also mean patients have to wait longer for a SANE to get to them.\nAdditionally, when the St. Tammany Parish coroner, Christopher Tape, fired all of the SANEs his office employed, which provided care for residents of five parishes, the two full-time Jefferson Parish traveling SANEs picked up the workload.\nTape said in a press statement he believed the SANE program was \u201cillegal\u201d because St. Tammany parish taxpayers paid for services provided to four neighboring parishes. But a former St. Tammany parish coroner said it did not pose a significant financial burden and that it was largely funded through grants and federal funds. (According to a WWL investigation, Tape was previously indicted on charges that he sexually assaulted a minor, though the charges were later quashed after the court found the state had violated his right to a speedy trial. He also settled a 2022 civil complaint from a female employee who accused him of \u201cunwanted advances.\u201d)\nThe two full-time Jefferson Parish traveling SANEs now cover 19 hospitals in six parishes, an area of 3,659 square miles with a population of more than a million people \u2014 larger than the state of Delaware and nearly the population of the state of Montana.\nThe workload of traveling SANEs can take a toll on the nurses themselves. Being a SANE is already difficult and demanding work. With the shortage, there are even more patients who need their care.\n\u201cHonestly, a lot of us that have been doing this have been doing it a while and we are very much on our last leg,\u201d Ginesse Barrett, one of the two full-time Jefferson Parish traveling SANEs said in a February 26 Louisiana Sexual Assault Oversight Commission meeting.\nSexual assaults often do not occur during normal business hours. SANEs can get calls in the middle of the night to go to a hospital and meet with a survivor who has been recently traumatized. Heidi Tujague, a SANE at UMC in New Orleans, said many nurses have stopped being SANEs due to burnout \u2014 what she called \u201ccompassion fatigue.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen nurses who only last a year or two because they just cannot handle the extra trauma they\u2019re experiencing,\u201d Tujague said.\nTeleSANEs\nHealth care providers are exploring another potential solution for addressing the SANE shortage and the barrier travel imposes on survivors: telemedicine. A teleSANE can video call into a hospital exam room and guide an emergency nurse through a forensic exam. SANEs can be recruited from across the country under this model.\nHospitals in some states do use teleSANE programs. Shalotta Sharp, the SANE trainer in Mississippi, works remotely as a teleSANE in Arkansas. But she says she can\u2019t do this work in her own state or in neighboring Alabama and Louisiana, which currently do not have any teleSANE programs.\nSherrie Searcy-Lyle, a SANE at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, who helped start the teleSANE program in Arkansas, said the travel barrier to patients and the shortage of SANEs in the area \u2014 she said Arkansas only had four certified SANEs before \u2014 were huge factors influencing their decision to start a program.\n\u201cIt eliminates that need to transport patients outside of their community unless they choose to do that,\u201d Searcy-Lyle said. The teleSANE program is now in 27 hospitals across the state, she said.\n\u201cI know that we\u2019ve made an impact on making things happen for patients that would not have happened before without teleSANEs,\u201d Searcy-Lyle said.\nBut not all nurses feel that telemedicine is the solution to the problem of a shortage of SANEs.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very tempting to say, \u2018Let\u2019s look at this alternative model,\u2019\u201d said Michelle Mahon with National Nurses United. \u201cThe comparison is nothing or this . . . Nothing is unacceptable. But why are we not demanding what patients need?\u201d\nHigh turnover exacerbates staffing needs at Louisiana\u2019s child welfare agency, audit finds\nMahon said telehealth can\u2019t replace the in-person care that\u2019s vital for patients, especially survivors of sexual assault. Some research supports this. In an evaluation of a temporary teleSANE model deployed during the COVID-19 pandemic, teleSANEs noted challenges in reading patients\u2019 nonverbal cues and body language, which made it harder to ensure they were meeting their needs.\nOne clinician emphasized the importance of touch in sexual assault care: \u201cIt\u2019s hard when you can\u2019t reach out and touch somebody. Put a gentle hand on someone\u2019s arm or whatever. That\u2019s the part I didn\u2019t like the most.\u201d\nNon-SANE clinicians who participated in the research also highlighted the limitations of telehealth in creating human connections. As one described: \u201cThe [teleSANE] nurse on the iPad wasn\u2019t there to hold [the patient\u2019s] hand or talk to her face-to-face. I was the bridge, holding her, letting her cry on me. I know it was COVID-19 and we weren\u2019t supposed to be close, but she was crying on my shoulder.\u201d\nFunding and the future\nSome nurses say that teleSANEs can seem like attractive options for hospitals because fewer nurses can cover a wider area, which is less expensive than having a certified SANE nurse on-site in every community. But that doesn\u2019t address the underlying factors contributing to the shortage of SANEs, and nurses more broadly, says Michelle Mahon with NNU.\nThis goes beyond pay increases, Mahon said. Nurses primarily leave the industry for three reasons. The first is what she called \u201cmoral injury\u201d: working in an environment where nurses feel that they don\u2019t have enough resources or support to provide the care they feel their patients need.\nThe second reason is understaffing, which puts more of a burden on the nurses that do choose to remain in the practice. The third is workplace violence: In 2023, NNU surveyed 1,000 nurses from across the country \u2014 nearly half reported an increase in workplace violence in the previous year.\u201d\nPart of that underinvestment includes limited access to SANE trainings, which nurses often have to pay for themselves. Courses can range in cost from $350 to $600, though some organizations, like the one Shalotta Sharp works for, offer the education for free.\nSANE programs operate in different ways depending on regional policy. Some programs in Louisiana, like Jefferson Parish, are run by the parish coroner\u2019s office. Some are run by the individual hospital, like UMC, a public hospital with funding from the state of Louisiana.\nIn Louisiana, the state budget does not directly allocate funds to SANE programs.\nIn the February 26 Louisiana Sexual Assault Oversight Commission meeting, Louisiana State Senator Beth Mizell said there\u2019s an \u201cincredible disconnect\u201d with state legislators and the severity of the issue.\n\u201cThey think that the numbers are minute, they don\u2019t realize the amount of victims that we\u2019re talking about,\u201d Mizell said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t even have to be money problems. It\u2019s whether that\u2019s going to be a priority or whether it\u2019s always gonna be something that if we have extra money and you ask nice, maybe I\u2019ll give you a little bit of it.\u201d\nIn Louisiana, if the cost of the forensic exam exceeds the $1,600 reimbursed from the Crime Victims Reparations Fund, the hospital has to absorb the additional costs. Hospitals and healthcare providers with limited resources may not have the \u201cextra buffer\u201d to absorb the potential costs of conducting forensic exams, and a significant part of that can be paying for specialized nursing staff, said Monica Taylor, director of the Louisiana Governor\u2019s Office on Human Trafficking Prevention.\nThe SANE training that Shalotta Sharp helps lead in Mississippi is provided free-of-charge by the Mississippi Coalition Against Sexual Assault. But in order to attend, nurses have to take time off work and pay for their own travel, hotels, and food \u2014 along with other potential costs such as childcare arrangements.\nThis difficulty in accessing SANE-training can dissuade nurses from getting it. And as more nurses leave the profession or retire and fewer enroll in nursing school or re-join the industry, there may be even fewer SANEs available to patients.\nEven though she didn\u2019t have a choice where to go, Julie Ford said her experience with a SANE and an advocate at UMC was \u201cthe one thing in my situation that functioned the way it was supposed to.\u201d\nShe doesn\u2019t know if she would have chosen to go to West Jefferson Medical Center, where her medical care would have been covered by her insurance, or to go to UMC so she could get a forensic medical exam. But she wondered why that could have been a choice she would have to make in the first place \u2014 or why other survivors might have to choose to go to another hospital if they want a forensic exam.\n\u201cIf you put the ability to have forensic medical exams at every medical facility that would give people that kind of control that I think they deserve in that situation,\u201d Ford said.\nYOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.\nThis story was produced by the Gulf States Newsroom \u2014 a collaboration between Mississippi Public Broadcasting, WBHM in Alabama, WWNO and WRKF in Louisiana and NPR.

Erin Patterson\u2019s barrister says the jury in her triple murder trial cannot be convinced she did not eat the same beef wellingtons as her lunch guests, and should ignore evidence from the only other survivor of the meal that she served herself on a different coloured plate.\nColin Mandy SC also said in his closing address that Patterson was \u201cnot on trial for being a liar\u201d, and warned jurors against using \u201cdangerous and seductive\u201d hindsight reasoning to find her guilty.\nPatterson, 50, is facing three charges of murder and one of attempted murder in the Victorian supreme court.\nThe charges relate to the alleged deliberate poisoning of four lunch guests with beef wellingtons served at her house in Leongatha on 29 July 2023.\nPatterson has pleaded not guilty to murdering the relatives of her estranged husband, Simon Patterson \u2013 his parents, Don and Gail Patterson, and aunt, Heather Wilkinson \u2013 and attempting to murder his uncle, Ian Wilkinson, Heather\u2019s husband.\nAt the Latrobe Valley law courts in Morwell on Wednesday, Mandy said there was evidence that allowed the jury to find Patterson suffered death cap mushroom poisoning, as her guests had done, but that she suffered less severe poisoning.\nHe said this could have been due to her age, weight of more than 100kg, the fact she threw up hours after the lunch because she felt bloated, and the different toxic response of individuals.\nThis conclusion, that Patterson suffered a lower grade of poisoning, was supported by the evidence of Dimitri Gerostamoulos, Victoria\u2019s chief toxicologist, Mandy said.\nThe prosecution alleges Patterson did not eat the same beef wellingtons as her guests, and was appearing to be sick after the lunch to avoid suspicion.\nMandy said the jury should also find that if Patterson was lying about vomiting after binge eating cake after the lunch, then she would have changed her story to more clearly benefit her.\nIf she was lying, Mandy said, Patterson would not have said she vomited hours after the lunch, but rather immediately after the guests left, and she would have also given evidence that her vomit contained beef wellington, rather than saying she did not know.\nMandy, asking the jury to pardon the pun, said they should be careful about how they considered the \u201ccolourful\u201d evidence about the plates used to serve the lunch.\nHe said they should find Ian was \u201chonestly mistaken\u201d when he gave evidence the guests were served on a matching set of four grey plates, while Patterson served herself on a smaller coloured plate.\nMandy said the evidence of Simon, Patterson\u2019s children, a friend of her son\u2019s, and the footage of the police warrant shown in court was consistent about no such plates being used.\nMandy twice said that Patterson was not on trial for being a liar, once in reference to her behaviour after the lunch, and another in reference to misleading her lunch guests about having cancer.\nThe earlier reference came as Mandy was expanding on what he considered the fifth overarching theme of his closing address: hindsight reasoning.\nHe had flagged there were only expected to be four such themes on Tuesday: the \u201cflawed approach\u201d taken by the prosecution to the evidence, the honestly mistaken memory of witnesses, the burden of proof, and the duty of fairness incumbent on the prosecution.\n\u201cThis is not a court of moral judgment, you can\u2019t, you shouldn\u2019t, take a leap from this lie about a lump on her elbow to finding her guilty of triple murder,\u201d Mandy said.\n\u201cThose two things are a long way apart.\u201d\nMandy said the prosecution theory that Patterson lied to her lunch guests about having cancer because she knew the lie would \u201cdie with them\u201d, or, as he described it, would take it \u201cto their graves\u201d was an \u201cillogical and irrational theory\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a good thing \u2026 misleading people about whether you\u2019ve got cancer, but it\u2019s got nothing to do with any intention to kill or to harm them,\u201d Mandy said.\nMandy also said the prosecution theory that Patterson wanted Simon at the lunch so that he could be killed was \u201cabsurd\u201d.\nHindsight reasoning was dangerous and seductive, Mandy said, as it distorted how people evaluated decisions and actions that occurred in the past.\n\u201cWhatever Erin Patterson\u2019s intention was when she served the meal, is what it was,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the prosecution\u2019s job to prove what the accused actually did, and not to engage in hypothetical comparisons about what you or someone else might do in the same situation.\n\u201cThings seem obvious in retrospect, but that\u2019s not the right way of approaching it.\u201d\nMandy went on to say that certain evidence can seem sinister in hindsight, and provide a \u201cfalse clarity about ambiguous situations\u201d.\nBad outcomes also made reasonable possibilities seem less plausible, he said.\nHe described the prosecution\u2019s case in relation to Patterson picking death cap mushrooms in Loch after a post was made on iNaturalist, and then using her dehydrator to dry them, as \u201cspeculation upon speculation upon speculation\u201d.\nThe court has been told that Patterson\u2019s phone data suggested she may have stopped in Loch after the posts were made, and that photos of mushrooms shown on electronic scales appeared consistent with death caps.\nMandy also said to the jury, in a section of his address where he asked them to consider the evidence about why Patterson\u2019s children were not at the lunch: \u201cWhat\u2019s more likely? That she wanted to kill everyone, or that she wanted to reconnect with her family for the sake of her children?\u201d\nMandy\u2019s closing address will resume on Thursday.\nThe jury was told by Justice Christopher Beale earlier this week that he did not expect to finish his directions to them in the case before next Tuesday afternoon."]}, {"topic": 59, "name": "Trump-era political conflict and dissent", "keywords": "sen, paul, house, trump, picnic, white, hegseth, he, to, rand", "documents": ["Trump says Rand Paul is invited to White House picnic after senator said he wasn\u2019t. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that \"of course\" Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., was invited to an annual White House picnic, one day after the senator said he had been barred from the event.\n\"Of course Senator Rand Paul and his beautiful wife and family are invited to the BIG White House Party tonight,\" Trump said on Truth Social Thursday morning.\nPaul said on Wednesday that he was \"uninvited\" to an annual White House picnic typically attended by members of Congress and their families, framing the move to reporters Wednesday as retribution for his opposition to key components of President Donald Trump's agenda.\n\u201cThey\u2019re afraid of what I\u2019m saying, so they think they\u2019re going to punish me, I can\u2019t go to the picnic, as if somehow that\u2019s going to make me more conciliatory,\u201d Paul said on Wednesday. \u201cSo it\u2019s silly, in a way, but it\u2019s also just really sad that this is what it\u2019s come to. But petty vindictiveness like this, it makes you \u2014 it makes you wonder about the quality of people you\u2019re dealing with.\u201d\nTrump said in Thursday's post that Paul's attendance would give \"me more time to get his Vote on the Great, Big, Beautiful Bill, one of the greatest and most important pieces of legislation ever put before our Senators & Congressmen/women.\" Paul has been a leading critic of the Trump-backed bill because of its projected to increase the national deficit.\nNBC News has reached out to Paul's office for comment on whether he has received an invitation. After Trump's comments, Paul posted a picture to X of him and his grandson, who was wearing a \"Make America Great Again\" hat.\n\"Turns out my grandson is actually invited to the Congressional Picnic!\" Paul said in the post. \"He is ready!\"\nPaul, who said he attended picnics hosted by Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama, told reporters on Wednesday that he called the White House to secure tickets to the annual picnic but was told he was not invited. He said he had family members flying to Washington to attend the event, including his son, daughter-in-law and 6-month-old grandson, who he noted owns a \"Make America Great Again\" hat.\n\u201cI just find this incredibly petty,\u201d Paul told reporters. \"I have been, I think, nothing but polite to the president. I have been an intellectual opponent, a public policy opponent, and he\u2019s chosen now to uninvite me from the picnic and to say my grandson can\u2019t come to the picnic.\"\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a series of questions, including whether Paul was ever invited to the event and whether Trump was directly involved in the decision to \"uninvite\" him.\nAs Trump pushes Republicans to pass a package of measures to fund much of his domestic agenda by Independence Day, Paul is among the Senate Republicans poised to make that milestone unreachable, joining fiscal hawks in the party to balk at legislation the Congressional Budget Office estimates said would add $2.4 trillion to the national deficit.\nIn addition to his belief that the funding package would \"explode the debt,\" Paul has criticized spending cuts in the bill as \"wimpy and anemic,\" called planned Medicaid changes in the legislation \"bad strategy\" and proposed cutting billions of dollars for Trump's border wall from the bill.\n\u201cIn private, there\u2019s quite a few people in there who actually do think we could save some money and are open-minded to it and believe the administration should justify the numbers,\u201d Paul told reporters after a two-hour meeting on the bill Wednesday. \u201cEven if you\u2019re supportive, and I am supportive of border security, but I\u2019m just not supportive of a blank check.\u201d\nPaul said this week he plans to vote no on the legislation and speculated Wednesday that that might be among the reasons the invitation was rescinded.\n\u201cI\u2019m arguing from a true belief and worry that our country is mired in debt and getting worse, and they choose to react by uninviting my grandson to the picnic,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I just think it really makes me lose a lot of respect I once had for Donald Trump.\u201d\nTrump has frequently lashed out at Paul in response to the sustained opposition, deriding him on Truth Social for his criticisms.\n\"Rand Paul has very little understanding of the BBB, especially the tremendous GROWTH that is coming. He loves voting 'NO' on everything, he thinks it\u2019s good politics, but it\u2019s not,\" Trump wrote last week.\nPaul has emerged as a chief critic of Trump\u2019s fiscal policy, and he has intensely criticized his decision to impose tariffs on major U.S. trading partners, arguing they will push the country into a recession.\nPaul, a libertarian conservative, was one of four Republican senators to back a Democratic resolution to block the implementation of Trump's Canadian tariffs, predicting at the time that the import penalties would \"threaten us with a recession\" and calling Trump's decision to impose tariffs on major U.S. trading partners \"a terrible, terrible idea.\" The effort has so far stalled in the House.\nPaul also joined Democrats in introducing a bipartisan resolution to undo the \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs Trump imposed on dozens of countries, this time by terminating the national emergency he declared to implement the global penalties, arguing that Trump had exceeded his presidential authority.\n\u201cTariffs are taxes, and the power to tax belongs to Congress\u2014not the president. Our Founders were clear: tax policy should never rest in the hands of one person,\u201d Paul said in a statement about the bipartisan effort. \u201cAbusing emergency powers to impose blanket tariffs not only drives up costs for American families but also tramples on the Constitution. It\u2019s time Congress reasserts its authority and restores the balance of power.\u201d\nThat effort failed to pass the Senate.\nPaul's differences with Trump even extend to the military parade taking place Saturday, which he likened to parades in countries led by dictators.\n\"I wouldn't have done it,\" Paul said Tuesday. \"The images you saw in the Soviet Union and North Korea, we were proud not to be that.\"\nBut still, in the face of his criticisms of Trump, Paul appeared to view the rescinded invitation as a shock, noting that even Democratic lawmakers remain invited to the White House picnic.\n\"I think I\u2019m the first senator in the history of United States to be uninvited to the White House picnic,\u201d Rand told reporters. \"Literally, every Democrat is invited, every Republican is invited, and to say that my family is no longer welcome, kind of sad, actually.\u201d", "Sen.

Alex Padilla, D-Calif., was forcefully removed from a Department of Homeland Security press conference in Los Angeles held by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. The White House condemned Padilla, describing his actions as a \"theater-kid stunt.\"\n- BILL SIGNING: President Donald Trump signed a bill that blocks a California rule that sought to ban the sale of new gas-powered vehicles by 2035. The president delivered remarks on a wide-ranging list of topics, including his falling out with Elon Musk and deploying the National Guard in Los Angeles in response to anti-immigration raid protests.\n- CONGRESSIONAL PICNIC: Members of Congress and their families will attend an annual picnic at the White House today. That potentially includes Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who Trump now said is invited to go after the senator said his invitation was canceled over his opposition to some of the president's policies.\n- HOUSE RESCISSIONS VOTE: The House narrowly passed a Republican bill canceling $9.4 billion in spending on the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Public Broadcasting Service, National Public Radio and other programs, with the aim of codifying cuts proposed by the Department of Government Efficiency.\n- PETE HEGSETH TESTIMONY: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth faced questions from the House Armed Services Committee in his third appearance at a congressional hearing this week to discuss the Pentagon's budget request.

Alex Padilla for interrupting Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's press conference in Los Angeles today, calling the senator's behavior \"immature\" and a \"theater-kid stunt.\"\n\"Padilla stormed a press conference, without wearing his Senate pin or previously identifying himself to security, yelled, and lunged toward Secretary Noem.

Adriano Espaillat, D-N.Y., the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, this afternoon called for the arrest of the agents involved in the forced removal and handcuffing of Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., characterizing the incident as an \"assault.\"\n\u201cWe want a fast and full investigation on the assault of Senator Alex Padilla. That\u2019s what we want. We want those people that assaulted him to be looked at and to be arrested,\u201d Espaillat said, adding the Congressional Hispanic Caucus is \"fully behind\" Padilla.\nEspaillat said the incident was part of a broader effort by the administration to crack down on dissent, which he framed as a sign of a democracy in danger.\n\u201cAnybody that sees the video will see that he was aggressively assaulted and thrown on the ground for simply just wanting to express his opinion or ask a question,\" Espaillat said. \"The censoring of dissent will put this democracy and has put this democracy in danger.\"\nSen. Gary Peters says forcible removal of Padilla was 'unacceptable'\nSen. Gary Peters of Michigan, a ranking Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, this afternoon condemned the forcible removal of Padilla from a news conference.\n\"He was dragged out, taken out, because he was trying to ask a question -- thrown to the floor,\" Peters said in a video statement on X.\n\"It is absolutely unacceptable as a member of Congress, you have a right to ask questions, to stand up for the people that we represent, and what we saw today, is simply unacceptable,\" Peters added.\nCory Booker calls Padilla's handcuffing a 'pattern and a practice' by the Trump administration\nSen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., called the forcible removal and handcuffing of California Sen. Alex Padilla at a Department of Homeland Security news conference an \"abuse of authority\" by the Trump administration.\n\"It is a violent act, and there can be no justification of seeing a senator forced to their knees, laid flat on the ground, their hands twisted behind their back and being put into restraints,\" Booker said today on the Senate floor.\n\"This is a pattern and a practice, this is not an isolated incident,\" Booker added, referring to the arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in his state last month. Rep. LaMonica McIver, D-N.J., who was indicted this week on federal charges in connection with the Newark incident, has said she was \"assaulted\" by multiple ICE agents while speaking with reporters outside of the facility.\n\"We see time and time again, with this administration, trying to precipitate a response by the misuse and the abuse of force,\" Booker said. \"This is more akin to authoritarian governments when you see a democratic nation having their executive begin to arrest mayors, begin to arrest judges, begin to arrest a United States senator who is simply asking for answers to their questions.\"\nKamala Harris condemns Padilla's removal from a DHS event, calling it 'abuse of power'\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris condemned Padilla's removal from a DHS event in a statement, calling it \"a stunning abuse of power.\"\n\"United States Senator Alex Padilla was representing the millions of Californians who are demanding answers to this Administration\u2019s actions in Southern California,\" Harris wrote in a post on X. \"This is a shameful and stunning abuse of power.\"\nPadilla replaced Harris in the Senate after she left to serve as vice president.\nSen.

It is part of an effort by the White House to codify cuts proposed by the Department of Government Efficiency, which was helmed by tech billionaire Elon Musk.\nTrump pushed GOP lawmakers to back the bill just ahead of the House vote, posting on social media, \u201cThe Rescissions Bill is a NO BRAINER, and every single Republican in Congress should vote, \u2018YES.\u2019 MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\u201d\nFour House Republicans voted with 208 Democrats to reject the measure. Some GOP members flipped their votes from \u201cno\u201d to \u201cyes\u201d toward the end after realizing it wouldn\u2019t pass otherwise. (Four Democrats and two Republicans missed the vote.)\nThe package now heads to the Senate, where it isn\u2019t subject to the 60-vote threshold, meaning Republicans can pass it along party lines.\nShouting match breaks out over Padilla incident at House hearing\nA lengthy GOP-led House Oversight Committee hearing on states\u2019 immigration policies has focused increasingly over the last hour on the forcible removal of Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., from a news conference in Los Angeles after he tried to question Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.\nAs the testy hearing entered its sixth hour, Democrats on the panel have repeatedly sought to bring attention to the incident, with many attempting to introduce news articles for the record documenting it.\nDuring one prolonged exchange, Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., repeatedly pressed Comer and other Republicans to commit to subpoenaing Noem.\n\u201cJust shut up,\u201d Comer replied, after moments of back-and-forth yelling.\nRep. Majorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said over the melee, \u201cDemocrats can\u2019t follow the rules, can\u2019t follow the law\u201d as Frost continued to demand Comer\u2019s attention.\nThe hearing took a brief recess after that.\nCuomo's mayoral campaign uses L.A. protest footage to go after Trump \u2014 and an opponent\nAndrew Cuomo\u2019s campaign for mayor of New York has launched new digital ads on YouTube, Facebook and Instagram arguing that the former governor is the best candidate to take on Trump \u2014 using footage from the recent protests in Los Angeles to go after Zohran Mamdani, a state legislator and leading progressive candidate, for lacking experience.\n\"L.A. is in chaos. Imagine it\u2019s Times Square. Trump\u2019s coming for New York. Who do you think can stop him?\" the ad says. \"Zohran Mamdani is a 33-year-old, dangerously inexperienced legislator who\u2019s passed just three bills with a staff you can fit inside a New York elevator.\"\n\"New York already has a crisis of affordability and safety.

We need someone experienced to slam them shut.\"\n'Zero tolerance': DOJ official encourages prosecutors to use same laws used against Trump pardonees\nA Justice Department official encouraged top federal prosecutors across the country to pursue cases related to immigration protests, specifically listing many of the same laws that Jan. 6 defendants were charged under before they were mass pardoned by the president on the day of his inauguration.\n\u201cAcross the country we have seen instances of rioting, looting, arson, destruction of property, assaults on officers (federal, state, and local), and obstruction of federal immigration enforcement efforts,\u201d the email said, adding that the department \u201chas zero tolerance for any such criminal behavior.\u201d\nIn the email to U.S. attorneys, first assistants and criminal chiefs that was seen by NBC News, the official listed several 13 laws prosecutors should consider. Those included several statutes that were used against Jan. 6 rioters, including those related to assaulting, resisting or impeding certain officers or employees; civil disorder; and damage to government property. The message also mentions similar charges that Jan. 6 defendants faced, like obstruction of proceedings before departments and agencies, and picketing or parading with the intent to obstruct or impede the administration of justice.\nOne notable potential charge mentioned on the list is an incitement charge under the Anti-Riot Act that came up in discussions around Jan. 6 but was never deployed because it has faced setbacks in courts; various courts found components of the law unconstitutional and that it had a chilling effect on free speech.\nThat law was passed in 1968 as a rider to the Civil Rights Act, and was championed by segregationist Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C. The debate over the law specifically referred to prominent Black leaders, and the law was used against the Chicago Seven, but was more recently put to the test against white supremacists.\nAsked about the email, a Justice Department official said in a statement: \u201cAs we\u2019ve said repeatedly, the Department respects the right to peacefully protest & assemble to engage on important issues. However, the Department and its 94 US Attorney Offices will not tolerate unlawful violence & destruction of property. We are prepared to respond accordingly.\u201d\nSen. Rand Paul jokes that his MAGA hat-wearing grandson is invited to the congressional picnic\nSen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., joked in a post on X this afternoon that his grandson has been invited to the congressional picnic this evening at the White House.\nThe post included a photo of him and his young grandson, who was wearing a backward \"Make America Great Again\" hat.\nThe senator had said yesterday that he and his family were uninvited to the annual event, but Trump said on Truth Social this morning that the GOP senator was invited to the picnic.\nGOP Rep.

David Valadao, R-Calif., told NBC News that the impact the Trump administration's ICE raids are having on migrant workers is \"really concerning.\"\nValadao said mass ICE raids would have a \u201chuge impact\u201d on his Central Valley district\u2019s ability to \u201cfeed the country and, frankly, the rest of the world.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve reached out over this entire administration, talking about that, always trying to make sure that our voices were heard, that they understood that there are people who are applying to our community, and they play a lot of role in the nation, building housing, taking care of folks in all types of industries, and so we hope that that message got through,\" Valadao said. \"I know the president has made some positive comments in the past, but the actions over the last few weeks have been really concerning.\"\nValadao, who represents a politically competitive seat in California, wrote on X on Tuesday that he was \u201curging\u201d the administration to focus on deporting criminals instead of the \u201chardworking people\u201d in his district.\nNewsom calls Trump a 'stone-cold liar'\nGov. Gavin Newsom, D-Calif., called Trump a \"stone-cold liar\" in an episode of \"The Daily\" podcast that was released Thursday.\nNewsom, speaking with the New York Times podcast, spoke about the phone call he had with Trump on Friday evening, where he claimed that Trump did not discuss his plan to federalize the National Guard to quell anti-deportation protests in Los Angeles.\n\"It didn\u2019t appear to me when I talked to him. He never brought it up. Period, full stop, he lied about that. Yeah, last Friday night. He lied. He lied. My mother and dad\u2019s grave,\" Newsom told \"The Daily.\" \"I don\u2019t mess around when I say this. He lied. Stone-cold liar. Don\u2019t think for a second he told the truth. He lied.\"\nNewsom said he and Trump had a \"cordial\" chat in that phone call that barely touched upon the protests in Los Angeles, adding that Trump's decision to federalize the National Guard \"came completely out of left field.\"\nThe governor said that on Saturday, he was surprised to wake up to Trump's statements calling him \"Newscum.\"\n\"Then talks about the National Guard, and then starts making up all these things he claimed he told me about, which honestly starts to disturb me on a different level that maybe he actually believed he said those things,\" Newsom said.\n\"And he\u2019s not all there. I mean that,\" the governor added.\nNewsom also spoke about Trump's decision to direct hundreds of Marines to Los Angeles, calling the move a \"red line.\"\n\"I think it\u2019s a red line when you\u2019re using military that are trained for foreign incursions to do domestic law enforcement in American cities,\" Newsom said. \"I think that\u2019s a red line. If that\u2019s not a red line, I don\u2019t know what red lines mean. This is the United States military being used for domestic law enforcement.\"\nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff says the military 'should stay out of politics'\nRep. Chris Deluzio, D-Pa., used part of his time in the hearing on the Pentagon budget request to express concerns over politicization of the military.\nDeluzio asked Lt. Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, what military officials should do if an event they attend turns political. His question came after he sharply criticized Trump's comments to troops at Fort Bragg.\nCaine declined to weigh in.\n\"By even my engaging in answering this question, that is making my job involved in politics,\" he said. \"And so while I appreciate the question, I think the chairman and the force should stay out of politics.\"\nTrump is open to dialogue with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, White House says\nTrump \u201cremains receptive\u201d to communications with Kim Jong Un, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, even as the North Korean leader appears less interested in talks over his nuclear and ballistic missile programs.\nTrump would \u201clike to see the progress that was made at that summit in Singapore,\u201d Leavitt told reporters yesterday, referring to the first in-person summit between the two leaders in 2018.\nLeavitt was responding to a question about a news report that said North Korea had refused to accept a letter from Trump that was intended to reopen channels of communication between Washington and Pyongyang.\nHer comments come as both North and South Korea appear to have suspended propaganda loudspeaker blasts at their shared border in an effort to reduce tensions on the Korean Peninsula. The two countries technically remain at war after the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice rather than a peace treaty.\nKim has continued to make advancements in his weapons programs since his last meeting with Trump in 2019, and has been further strengthened by a security partnership with Russia.\nRep. Patrick Smith tells Hegseth he 'should resign'\nRep. Patrick Smith, D-N.Y., criticized what he painted as an infusion of politics into a military event when Trump delivered a speech at Fort Bragg this week.\nHe urged officials like Hegseth to \"continue to echo the apolitical nature\" of the military.\n\"Mr. Secretary, I don't say this lightly. I have to say this on the record. I think your tenure as secretary of defense has been shameful and weak, and you should resign,\" Smith said in concluding his remarks.\nTrump wraps White House event after nearly 90 minutes\nAfter nearly 90 minutes, Trump's bill signing event, which included an impromptu press conference with reporters, has ended.\nTrump says 'I don't feel like a king' when asked about 'No Kings' protests planned for Saturday\nTrump told reporters at the White House that he doesn't feel like a king when asked about so-called No Kings protests against his agenda that are planned to coincide with his military parade on Saturday.\n\"I don't feel like a king. I have to go through hell to get stuff,\" he said when asked about the protests.\nA king \"wouldn't have to call up [House Speaker] Mike Johnson and [Senate Majority Leader John] Thune and say, 'Fellas, you got to pull this off,' and after years, we get it done,\" Trump said, referring to legislation to advance his agenda. \"No, no, we're not a king. We're not a king at all.\"\nTrump said his administration will address impact of its immigration policies on agriculture workforce\nTrump said his administration is \u201cgoing to have to use common sense\u201d to address the impacts of its hard-line immigration policies on the agriculture and tourism industries.\n\u201cOur farmers are being hurt badly,\u201d Trump said while speaking to reporters at the White House today. \u201cWe can\u2019t take farmers and take all their people and send them back because they don\u2019t have, maybe what they\u2019re supposed to have, maybe not.\u201d\nTrump referenced a post he made on Truth Social this morning where he claimed farmers and business leaders have complained his immigration policies are harming their workforce and \u201ctaking very good, long-time workers away from them.\u201d The president added that \"changes are coming.\"\n\"They end up hiring the people, the criminals that have come in, the murderers from prisons and everything else,\" Trump told reporters today.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have an order on that pretty soon,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think we can\u2019t do that to our farmers and leisure to hotels. We\u2019re going to have to use common sense.\"\nTrump said Elon Musk chose to support him despite his clear plans to slash EV incentives\nTrump said Elon Musk, who recently feuded with the president online over his proposed cuts to electric vehicle tax credits, still chose to endorse him despite his plans to slash the incentives.\n\u201cI used to say, I\u2019m amazed that he\u2019s endorsing me, because that can\u2019t be good for him. I\u2019m abolishing the EV mandate,\u201d Trump said during a bill signing at the White House today. \u201cI once asked him about it. ... He said, \u2018Well, as long as it\u2019s happening to everybody, I\u2019ll be able to compete.\u2019 It\u2019s a very interesting answer.\u201d\nTrump claimed that Musk never advocated for the preservation of what he calls the electric vehicle mandate, a Biden-era EPA rule that sought to cut auto emissions and expand consumer access to electric vehicles.\n\u201cHe makes electric cars,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re saying you\u2019re not going to be able to make electric cars, or you\u2019re not going to be forced to make all of those cars.\u201d\nThe comments came as Trump prepared to sign legislation to block California\u2019s plan to phase out gas-powered cars and end their sales by 2035. Musk last week attacked the Trump-backed GOP domestic policy bill over its impact on the federal deficit, calling it a \u201cdisgusting abomination.\u201d\nThe Tesla CEO walked back his comments in a post on X yesterday, saying they \u201cwent too far.\u201d Trump also moved the bright red Tesla he had been displaying outside of the White House in support of Musk, but said at today\u2019s White House signing that he likes the cars.\n\u201cHe got a little bit strange,\u201d Trump said of Musk, claiming, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know why.\u201d\nTrump says an Israeli strike on Iran is 'something that could very well happen'\nTrump said during a press availability at the White House that an Israeli strike on Iran could happen.\n\"I don\u2019t want to say imminent, but it looks like it\u2019s something that could very well happen. Look, it\u2019s very simple, not complicated,\" he told reporters when asked if an Israeli strike on Iran was imminent.\n\"Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon,\" he continued. \"Other than that, I want them to be successful. I want them to be tremendous. We'll help them be successful. We'll trade with them. We'll do whatever is necessary.\"\nNBC News reported overnight that Israel is considering taking military action against Iran, five people with knowledge of the situation said, though it will likely happen without U.S. support.\nThe Trump administration has been trying to negotiate a deal that would curb Iran's nuclear program, but no agreement has been reached yet.\nTrump delivers campaign-style remarks during bill signing: 'I\u2019d rather be electrocuted'\nTrump delivered a stem-winding speech that delved into tariffs, inflation rates, windmills, his election victory and more in the White House East Room during a bill signing to overturn California\u2019s new ban on gas-powered vehicles. Boasting of ending green energy policies, Trump said that he had discussed his plans with his now-departed adviser, Elon Musk, founder of the electric vehicle company Tesla.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why Elon doesn\u2019t like me very much,\u201d Trump quipped in reference to the pair\u2019s recent public fallout. \u201cBut he actually does, he does,\u201d he said, after Musk acknowledged in a social media post this week that he \u201cwent too far\u201d in attacking Trump.\nTrump\u2019s remarks were reminiscent of a campaign speech at times, as he wove through topics as diverse as the animal kingdom, combustion engines and California Gov. Gavin Newsom. Of a potentially fearsome encounter with sharks, Trump mused, \u201cI\u2019d rather be electrocuted.\u201d\nHe also offered praise for Lee Zeldin, his EPA administrator, and his chief of staff, Susie Wiles, someone who he said \u201ccould destroy five nations with five calls,\u201d in a testament to her influence.\nTrump calls Jerome Powell a 'numbskull' as he urges rate cut\nTrump called Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell a \u201cnumbskull\u201d during remarks at the White House today, urging him to lower interest rates.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to fire him,\u201d Trump said of Powell, but added that \u201call he has to do is to lower\u201d rates.\n\u201cWhat is he doing? Why doesn\u2019t he lower these rates?\u201d Trump said, repeating a common criticism he makes of Powell.\nIn a recent statement, Powell spoke out in defense of the independence of the Federal Reserve following pressure from Trump to cut interest rates. The chairman's comments followed a meeting with Trump last month where he said the two discussed \u201ceconomic developments.\u201d\nAsked whether men and women are both capable of killing, Hegseth says it 'depends on the context'\nAsked repeatedly by Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, D-Pa., whether both men and women are able to cause death, Hegseth responded several times that it \"depends on the context.\"\nHoulahan asked Hegseth whether both men and women were capable of pulling rifle triggers to cause death, to which Hegseth said, \"Sure.\" She then asked whether both men and women were capable of operating drones and launching missiles.\n\"I know what you're getting at, ma'am,\" he said as the two began talking over each other.\n\"Men and women carry equipment differently,\" Hegseth said, adding that there are physical differences between men and women.\nHoulahan continued, criticizing Hegseth's comments about different genders in the military. The defense secretary has said that women should not serve in combat roles, but has since walked back those comments.\n\"Lethality is equal parts technical skills, tactical experience, cognitive problem solving and physical fitness,\" Houlahan said. \"It's not about one person, but it's about many.\"\nHegseth dodges on whether he would abide by court decisions on Trump's response to L.A. protests\nHegseth flouted multiple questions from Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., over whether he would abide by court decisions on whether Trump can deploy troops to respond to protests in Los Angeles despite Newsom's objections.\n\"Whatever the federal district court decides, will you abide by it?\" Khanna asked.\nHegseth answered that it was a \"pending situation.\" Asked again, he said, \"What I will tell you is, my job right now is to ensure the troops that we have in Los Angeles are capable of supporting law enforcement.\"\nPressed again, Hegseth said, \"We've always looked to the decisions of the court.\"\nKhanna again urged Hegseth to assure people that he would respect Supreme Court and other federal court decisions on the issue.\n\"What I can say is we should not have local judges determining foreign policy or national security policy for the country,\" Hegseth said.\n\"So you're not willing to say you would respect those decisions?\" Hegseth asked.\n\"What I'm saying is, local district judges shouldn't make foreign policy for the United States,\" Hegseth said.\nNewsom dings Trump for saying farmers and business leaders are complaining about his immigration policies\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has been clashing with Trump in recent days over the administration's hard-line immigration policies, continued to hammer against his deportation actions today.\nThe Democratic governor and potential 2028 presidential contender responded to Trump writing in a post on Truth Social that farmers and business leaders have complained to him that his immigration policies are \"taking very good, long time workers away from them\" and that \"changes are coming!\"\n\u201cTurns out, chasing hard working people through ranches and farms and snatching women and children off the streets is not good policy,\u201d Newsom wrote in a post on X.\nTwo police officers sue over failure to hang plaque honoring those who defended the Capitol on Jan. 6\nHarry Dunn and Daniel Hodges, two police officers who have been outspoken about the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, have sued the architect of the Capitol over its failure to hang a plaque honoring officers who protected the building that day.\n\"They bring this suit to compel Congress to follow its own law and install the mandated memorial, to honor the women and men who saved the lives of those inside the building, and to ensure that the history of this attack on the Capitol \u2014 and on democracy \u2014 is not forgotten,\" the lawsuit says.\nCongress passed the law in 2022 to install the plaque on the western front of the U.S. Capitol and was signed by then-President Joe Biden. \"That was over three years ago,\" the suit says.\n\"While Congress has installed a memorial to other officers who died in a different tragedy, it has not installed the plaque to honor those who defended the Capitol on January 6,\" they say. \"Meanwhile, though Congress has not placed the memorial to the officers who protected it, members have managed to honor the man who inspired the violence,\" referring to Trump.\nDunn and Hodges argue that by not hanging the plaque, Congress is encouraging the \"rewriting of history.\" \"It suggests that the officers are not worthy of being recognized, because Congress refuses to recognize them.\"\nBrendan Ballou, lead attorney in the case and a former Jan. 6 prosecutor, said in a statement, \u201cThese plaintiffs, and the officers they stood beside, were literally the only thing that saved the democratic transfer of power that day, and democracy itself. And they saved countless lives of people inside the Capitol. The Architect of the Capitol must follow the law, and must honor these officers, to prevent history from being rewritten.\u201d\nThe architect of the Capitol, Thomas E. Austin, who was selected in 2024 by a bicameral congressional commission, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nRep. Moulton and Hegseth clash over Signal chat\nRep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., pushed Hegseth repeatedly on his involvement in a Signal group chat, where the defense secretary shared sensitive military information.\nMoulton pressed Hegseth on the classification level of the information he shared, and Hegseth deflected multiple questions.\n\"It's not classified to disclose whether or not it was classified, and in fact, DOD regulations state that any classified information has to be labeled with its classification, was it classified secret or top secret,\" Moulton said during their exchange.\n\"What's not classified is that it was an incredibly successful mission against the Houthis,\" Hegseth said.\nLater, Moulton asked Hegseth whether he would take accountability. Hegseth defended his actions in the chat, saying that he did not name targets, locations or methods. He also pivoted to saying that the Houthis were held accountable and praised U.S. troops.\nHegseth said multiple times that he serves at the pleasure of the president.\nTesty House committee exchange on sanctuary policies offers possible preview of 2026 New York governor race\nDuring a testy exchange at a GOP-led House Oversight Committee hearing over on states' immigration policies, Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., grilled New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul \u2014 offering a possible preview of next year's gubernatorial race in the state.\nStefanik, who is considering a run for governor, is not a member of the committee. But the panel's chairman, Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., allowed several lawmkers to join in on the questioning of Hochul and Govs. Tim Walz of Minnesota and JB Priztker of Illinois.\nStefanik used the opportunity to attack Hochul, repeatedly bringing up instances of undocumented immigrants having committed crimes in in the state, saying that they were emblematic of \u201cKathy Hochul\u2019s New York.\u201d\n\u201cNo amount of words is going to clean up your failed record, and these horrific crimes committed in the sanctuary state that you created,\u201d Stefanik said.\nIn what at times resembled potential campaign messaging, Stefanik said that the crimes were \u201cone of the many reasons why you\u2019re hemorrhaging support from hard working\u201d New Yorkers.\n\u201cWe deserve a governor who stands up for law-abiding New Yorkers, who doesn\u2019t put illegals first, but actually puts New Yorkers first,\u201d Stefanik continued.\nHochul hit back by saying that Stefanik was simply \u201cgoing after the viral moment.\"\nRep. Mike Turner pushes Hegseth to clarify testimony on military plans for Greenland\nRep.

You are not confirming in your testimony today that at the Pentagon, there are plans for invading or taking by force Greenland, correct? That is not your testimony today?\" Turner asked.\n\"All my testimony is that the Pentagon has plans for any number of contingencies,\" Hegseth responded.\n\"It is not your testimony today that there are plans at the Pentagon for taking by force or invading Greenland, correct?\" Turner asked again more forcefully. \"Because I sure as hell hope that it is not your testimony.\"\n\"We look forward to working with Greenland to ensure that it is secured from any potential threats,\" Hegseth said.\nRep.

Adam Smith, D-Wash., pressed Hegseth repeatedly as to whether the military had plans to forcibly take over Greenland or the Panama Canal, areas that Trump has said he wants as part of the U.S.\n\"Is it the policy of the Department of Defense that we need to be prepared to take Greenland and Panama by force, if necessary?\" Smith asked.\nHegseth pivoted to talking about concerns over China's influence, prompting Smith to cut in and the two men to talk over each other when Hegseth emphasized the importance of the two countries.\nSmith said he was concerned over the possibility of the U.S. trying to take over the countries by force.\n\"Our job at the DOD is to have plans,\" Hegseth said.\n\"Do you have a plan for that?\" Smith asked.\n\"Our job at the Defense Department is to have plans for any particular contingency,\" Hegseth said.\nSmith asked Hegseth, \"To be clear, you do \u2014 you have plans to take Panama and Greenland by force if necessary.\"\n\"I think the American people would want the Pentagon to have plans for any particular contingency,\" Hegseth said.\n\"Not for that,\" Smith said.\nRep. Adam Smith: 'Can we please just stop and get back to the business of treating everybody equally and with respect?'\nRep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., criticized the Defense Department's focus on culture war issues, calling out Hegseth's push against people like transgender troops serving in the armed forces.\n\"We are a diverse nation, we need to be inclusive and we need to not actively insult people who don't happen to fit our preconceived notion of what a member of the military should look like,\" Smith said.\nSmith slammed the administration for renaming military bases so they now share the names of Confederate soldiers.\n\"Can we please just stop and get back to the business of treating everybody equally and with respect?\" Smith asked.\nTrump says business leaders are saying that mass deportations are affecting their workforce\nIn a post on TruthSocial this morning, Trump said that he's heard from business leaders that his mass deportation agenda \"is taking very good, long time workers away from them.\"\n\"Our great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace,\" the president wrote.\nHe added, \"In many cases the Criminals allowed into our Country by the VERY Stupid Biden Open Borders Policy are applying for those jobs.

Several eruptions sent ash up to 5,000 meters (16,400 feet) into the sky Tuesday evening to Wednesday afternoon. An eruption Tuesday afternoon sent thick, gray clouds 10,000 meters (about 32,800 feet) into the sky that expanded into a mushroom-shaped ash cloud visible as much as 150 kilometers (nearly 93 miles) away.

Senate Republicans hold hearing on Biden's mental fitness as Democrats boycott\nRepublican senators are looking into former President Joe Biden's ability to serve in office\nWASHINGTON -- Nearly six months after Joe Biden left the White House, Senate Republicans are still scrutinizing his presidency, kicking off the first in what's expected to be a series of congressional hearings this year on his mental fitness in office.\nRepublicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee brought in three witnesses Wednesday \u2014 none of whom served in Biden's administration \u2014 to scrutinize his time in office, arguing that Biden, his staff and the media must be held accountable. Democrats boycotted the hearing and criticized Republicans for \u201carm chair diagnosing\u201d Biden when the committee could be looking into serious matters.\nSen. John Cornyn of Texas, who co-chaired the hearing, said that they will aim to \u201cshine a light on exactly what went on in the White House during Biden's presidency.\u201d\n\u201cWe simply cannot ignore what transpired because President Biden is no longer in office,\u201d Cornyn said.\nA spokesperson for Biden declined to comment on the hearing.\nIt was the first in what could be several hearings about Biden in the coming months. Over in the House, the Oversight Committee has subpoenaed several of Biden\u2019s former staff members, along with his White House doctor, ordering him to testify at a June 27 hearing \u201cas part of the investigation into the cover-up of President Joe Biden\u2019s cognitive decline.\u201d\nQuestions about Biden\u2019s age and fitness erupted last summer after his disastrous performance in a debate against Donald Trump, which ultimately led to his withdrawal from the race.\nEven after Trump won back the presidency in November, Republicans have continued to hammer on Biden's age, citing in part new reporting about Biden that was published this year.\nTrump now alleges that Biden administration officials may have forged the former president\u2019s signature and taken sweeping actions without his knowledge, though he provided no evidence of that happening. But Trump has ordered lawyers at the White House and the Justice Department to investigate.\nRepublicans played clips during the hearing Wednesday of Democrats defending Biden. In the montage, the Democrats talk about how Biden was mentally sharp when he was in office.\n\u201cMost Democrats on this committee have chosen to all but boycott the hearing and have failed to call a single witness,\u201d said Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo. \u201cThey have chosen to ignore this issue, like they ignored President Biden's decline.\u201d\nSen. Dick Durbin, the committee\u2019s top Democrat, criticized Republicans for holding a hearing on the last president at a time when \u201cnumerous critical challenges facing the nation that are under our jurisdiction.\u201d\n\u201cApparently arm chair diagnosing former President Biden is more important than the issues of grave concern,\u201d said Durbin of Illinois.\nAfter his opening remarks, Durbin played a video montage of his own \u2014 but with clips of Trump speaking that he said reflected the \u201ccognitive ability\u201d of the current president. Durbin left the hearing after his opening remarks.\nThree witnesses testified: former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, former White House official Theodore Wold and University of Virginia law professor John Harrison. Spicer and Wold both served under Trump.\nMuch of the focus was on Biden's alleged use of an autopen. Trump has repeated long-standing allegations that the Biden White House relied on an autopen to sign presidential pardons, executive orders and other key documents, claiming that its use cast doubt on their validity.\nGOP Sen. Katie Britt also questioned Spicer on \u201cwhat mechanisms should we put in place\u201d to hold the media accountable \u201cfor not actually following what is clearly in front of them.\u201d\n___", "Democrats are \u2018stuck in that unfortunate reality\u2019 in debate over Biden's illness. Democrats are \u2018stuck in that unfortunate reality\u2019 in debate over Biden\u2019s illness\nThe former president\u2019s reemergence after departing the White House hasn\u2019t gone as planned.\nTwenty-four hours after the Sunday announcement that former President Joe Biden has an aggressive form of prostate cancer, one of his staunchest supporters, Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, said Monday he had yet to connect with him. Another close Hill ally, Sen. Chris Coons, had not spoken with his fellow Delawarean as of midafternoon Tuesday.\nBiden\u2019s longtime friend Bob Brady, the former House member from Pennsylvania who has known Biden for decades, said as of Tuesday afternoon that he hadn\u2019t talked with the former president directly since his cancer diagnosis, though he did touch base Monday with his family. All three said they planned to speak with him soon.\nBefore his cancer diagnosis, Biden had been taking the train from Delaware to Washington, meeting with his post-presidential staff, allies and former Cabinet secretaries, according to a Biden aide granted anonymity to speak freely. In New York City for his appearance on \u201cThe View,\u201d he met with former President Bill Clinton. And last week he met with Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, a rising star in the party.\nBut Biden, an inveterate creature of Washington who for most of his career seemed to gain life from glad-handing and working a room, hasn\u2019t yet talked to some longtime allies on Capitol Hill in the wake of his diagnosis. Months removed from his presidency, Biden has receded as a fixture of official Washington and has instead become a focal point of his party\u2019s recriminations \u2014 his planned reemergence after departing the White House running headlong into a devastating health diagnosis and an unsettled party growing increasingly anxious in the wilderness.\nSome Democrats said they are drafting notes or plan to speak with him. Coons said he was working on finding a time to connect with Biden. Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware said she has reached out to people \u201dvery close\u201d to the family \u201cand just shared my love, my prayers.\u201d Politicians on both sides of the aisle wished him well.\nMost Democrats are trying, yet again, to pivot from Biden\u2019s health to stay on message as the GOP advances President Donald Trump\u2019s domestic agenda.\nRep. Gabe Amo of Rhode Island, the only former Biden White House aide who now serves in Congress, faulted Biden\u2019s critics for capitalizing on what he called the \u201cpolitics of the moment.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s in their interest to talk about this rather than the issues of the day, so we\u2019re stuck in that unfortunate reality,\u201d Amo said. \u201cI hope that people are focused on one, a legacy of public service, and two, wishing him well in his recovery.\u201d\nOr as Rep. Veronica Escobar of Texas, a Biden reelection co-chair, put it, \u201cWe are living through a historic, terrifying backsliding of our democracy \u2026 I am so profoundly uninterested in talking about this issue.\u201d\nNot everyone wants to change the subject. Some Democrats, perhaps feeling burned by how Biden\u2019s decline was kept out of public view, are asking pointed questions about his cancer diagnosis \u2014 both publicly and privately.\nOn Monday, Ezekiel Emanuel, the oncologist and Biden\u2019s former pandemic adviser, opened the door on MSNBC\u2019s Biden-friendly \u201cMorning Joe\u201d to a round of questions about Biden\u2019s health when he said that Biden \u201cdid not develop [cancer] in the last 100, 200 days. He had it while he was president. He probably had it at the start of his presidency in 2021.\u201d\nAt best for Democrats, his remarks scanned to some observers as concern about the care the president received while in office. At worst, they fueled more accusations of a White House cover-up.\nIn a Monday interview, Emanuel said he could not rule out the possibility that Biden had been diagnosed earlier but that information somehow wasn\u2019t released.\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m not his doctor,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201cI can\u2019t rule out that possibility because I don\u2019t know what transpired there.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Biden said Tuesday the former president\u2019s \u201clast known\u201d prostate-specific antigen cancer screening test was in 2014 and that \u201cprior to Friday, President Biden had never been diagnosed with prostate cancer.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Biden has faced health challenges. When he was running for vice president in 2008, Biden disclosed that he had an enlarged prostate and a biopsy but that no evidence of cancer was found. His medical records also showed he had undergone prostate-specific antigen tests, which yielded normal results.\nMore than a decade later, when he was campaigning for the White House in 2019, Biden revealed he had been treated for his enlarged prostate, first with medication and later with surgery. The files stated he \u201cnever had prostate cancer.\u201d\nTrump seized on questions surrounding the timeline of diagnosis \u2014 something that had quickly become an obsession of Biden\u2019s right-wing detractors online \u2014 telling reporters he was \u201csurprised that it wasn\u2019t, you know, the public wasn\u2019t notified a long time ago because to get to stage 9, that\u2019s a long time.\u201d (Biden\u2019s diagnosis is stage-four prostate cancer.) Vice President JD Vance said he blamed the \u201cpeople around\u201d Biden.\nAsked about new allegations of a conspiracy to keep Biden\u2019s illness secret, Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said of Republicans advancing the idea, \u201cWhat a soulless bunch. Anybody who\u2019s spending time doing that, I\u2019ll pray for him in mass this Sunday.\u201d\nTo some allies of Biden, who relied on a small and, critics said, insular circle of advisers during his presidency, even acknowledging such questions is fraught.\n\u201cThis just feeds into the conspiracy theories. You have an electorate who doesn\u2019t pay attention, and this is breaking through,\u201d said Democratic strategist Kellan White, who worked as a senior adviser to Biden\u2019s campaign in Pennsylvania in 2024. \u201cAll a Gen Z voter who barely pays attention is hearing is, \u2018They weekend-at-Bernie-ed Joe Biden who now has cancer, which he probably had for 10 years.\u2019\u201d\nRep. Sarah McBride (D-Del.), who\u2019s long been close to the Bidens, said in a brief interview she\u2019d sent a message to the former president through his team and \u201cand expressed that I was praying for him and reiterated that he\u2019s in the hearts of every Delawarean right now.\u201d\nShe said she\u2019d spoken to him last at a St. Patrick\u2019s Day event in Wilmington and \u201che seemed in good spirits. He seemed healthy.\u201d\nBiden\u2019s diagnosis came just as some of the Democratic Party\u2019s brightest stars had begun to grapple with questions about ramifications of his decision to run for reelection \u2014 and the fallout for the party.\n\u201cThe historians will have to sort out the politics of the whole thing,\u201d Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), who weathered his own cancer diagnosis, said in an interview.\nHe added that he had not spoken to Biden but was drafting him a note. He said, \u201cBut at this point, there\u2019s nothing to do, but for those of us who love the guy, to express our solidarity and our sympathy.\u201d", "GOP says Dems admit \u2018guilt\u2019 in Biden health cover-up by boycotting Senate hearing on \u2018constitutional scandal\u2019. Republican lawmakers on the Senate Judiciary Committee admonished Democratic colleagues for boycotting and walking out of a Wednesday morning hearing examining former President Joe Biden's health decline while he was in the Oval Office.\n\"I will note that few of my Democratic colleagues are here today,\" Republican Texas Sen. John Cornyn said Wednesday. \"Thank you to Sen. Welch from Vermont for being here, leaving us with no other option than to take the boycott of this hearing as an admission of guilt for their role in this crisis.\n\"We must not turn away from the search for answers, and it is not an overstatement to say that the future of our country could one day hinge on how we choose to act or not act on this very issue,\" Cornyn continued.\nThe Senate committee held a hearing Wednesday morning dubbed, \"Unfit to Serve: How the Biden Cover-up Endangered America and Undermined the Constitution.\"\nSENATE HEARING ON WHO WAS 'REALLY RUNNING' BIDEN WHITE HOUSE KICKS OFF WEDNESDAY\nVermont Democrat Sen. Peter Welch and Illinois Democrat Sen. Dick Durbin did attend the start of the hearing, with Durbin abruptly walking out after describing the hearing as a distraction and accusing Republican colleagues of being \"asleep at the wheel\" with other legal issues within the Trump administration due to their focus on Biden.\n\"In the last week alone, several events have demanded this committee's immediate attention,\" Durbin said Wednesday. \"The horrific assassination in Minnesota, the treatment of our colleague Sen. Padilla by federal agents in Los Angeles, and President Trump's unprecedented deployment of the U.S. military in Los Angeles.\n\"We should hear without delay from Attorney General Bondi and FBI Director Patel about what they are doing to address the unacceptable political violence in our country, including threats to Article III judges and justices, as well as members of Congress,\" Durbin said. \"And we need to hear from the Homeland Security Secretary Noem about the treatment of our colleague, Sen. Padilla, and this administration's mass deportation campaign against immigrants.\"\nWelch also left the hearing after declaring it would not benefit his constituents.\nEX-WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS TO TESTIFY ON WHO 'REALLY RAN THE COUNTRY' DURING BIDEN ERA\nThere are 10 Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee, including lawmakers such as Sens. Klobuchar of Minnesota, Cory Booker of New Jersey, and Adam Schiff of California. The press secretary for Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats directed Fox Digital to Durbin's initial participation in the hearing and his remarks when asked about GOP lawmakers arguing Democrats' boycott of the hearing was an admission of guilt.\nRepublican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz seethed that Democrats and the media \"lied\" and covered up Biden's health decline, while slamming Democrats for their lack of participation.\n\"Not a single Democrat is here today because not a single one of them gives a d--- about the fact that they lied to the American people for four years,\" Cruz said at the hearing. \"They knew. Every one of them knew that Joe Biden was mentally not competent to do the job. The White House press secretary, she knew, when she stood in front of the American people and lied over and over and over again. And they're not here because they can't defend themselves. It wasn't a surprise, for four years, the White House hid President Biden from Republican senators. Would not let him meet with us.\"\nOther Republicans railed against Democratic counterparts for skipping the hearing, such as Missouri Republican Sen. Eric Schmidt.\n\"Today, as we seek to answer this question, it is deeply disappointing, but not surprising, that most Democrats on this committee have chosen all but boycott the hearing and failed to call a single witness,\" Schmidt said at the hearing. \"They have chosen to ignore this issue like they ignored President Biden's decline. Their absence speaks volumes, an implicit admission that the truth is too inconvenient to face.

The debate opened the floodgates of criticism, including traditional Democrat allies calling for Biden to drop out of the presidential race after conservatives had already long argued that Biden's mental acuity was slipping and he was unfit to serve as commander in chief.\nConcerns over his health have continued after his presidential tenure ended, including with the revelation that the Biden admin frequently used an autopen to sign official presidential documents, the release of Biden's interview with former Special Counsel Robert Hur, and Biden's shock announcement in May that he had advanced prostate cancer.\nThe conservative Heritage Foundation's Oversight Project first investigated the Biden administration's use of an autopen earlier in 2025 and found that the same signature was on a bevvy of executive orders and other official documents, while Biden\u2019s signature on the document announcing his departure from the 2024 race varied from the apparent machine-produced signature.\nSCOOP: GOP PUSH FOR NEW HOUSE COMMITTEE TO PROBE BIDEN DECLINE 'COVER-UP' GAINS STEAM\nHeritage fellow Wold testified before the committee and described the alleged cover-up of Biden's declining health a \"constitutional crisis.\"\n\"I will say the 25th Amendment. It's a modern contrivance, but it still is consistent with the American Constitution, which assumes that officers of the United States will act virtuously and morally,\" Wold said. \"And the idea that members of the Cabinet would go to the length of avoiding the Oval Office so as to abdicate their responsibility to verify the appropriateness of the president's acuity or the ability to authenticate actions taken by the president.

Donald Trump is threatening to keep 25% tariffs on some or all of its steel imports from the UK unless it gives specific guarantees over the Indian-owned steelmaking plant at Port Talbot in south Wales, sources have told the Guardian.\nAn agreement to reduce tariffs on UK car exports to the US and scrap them for the aerospace sector was signed off by the US president and Keir Starmer on Monday, on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Canada.\nHowever, it did not include the removal of tariffs on steel imports from the UK. Officials are still negotiating over the fine points of a deal to cover the steel and aluminium industry, amid US concerns about the fact that Tata Steel imports raw materials from abroad.\nStarmer told reporters in Banff, Canada: \u201cThere\u2019s further work to do in relation to steel, but we\u2019re getting on and doing that work.\u201d\nTrump and Starmer announced the main terms of the trade agreement in May, with the UK prime minister calling it a \u201cfantastic, historic day\u201d. According to that deal, tariffs on up to 100,000 British cars are due to be reduced to 10% from 27.5%.\nAs it stands, UK steelmakers still face 25% tariffs, although this is lower than the global tariff of 50% imposed by the Trump administration on other nations. The UK business department said the two leaders had pledged to \u201cmake progress towards 0% tariffs on core steel products as agreed\u201d in May.\nThe deal was heralded by Downing Street as a triumph for Starmer\u2019s brand of gentle diplomacy, in which he wooed the president with the promise of a state visit while shying away from any direct criticism on topics such as trade.\nThe May trade announcement itself was followed by weeks of further talks as the two sides continued to negotiate over the small print. Monday\u2019s announcement by the two leaders means the tariff reductions will kick in for aerospace and automobiles over the coming weeks, with Starmer saying they would begin \u201cvery soon\u201d.\nHowever, the Trump administration is understood to be seeking further guarantees on British steel exports, given Tata Steel has closed its blast furnaces at Port Talbot last year and therefore now imports raw materials from abroad until the planned opening of a new, much cleaner electric arc furnace in 2027.\nAccording to US import rules, steel must be \u201cmelted and poured\u201d in a country to qualify as having originated in that country.\nThe company says these supplies come from Tata\u2019s other sites, mainly those in the Netherlands and India.\nUS trade officials are considering granting Tata an exemption, sources say, but are asking for guarantees about when it will switch on its new electric arc furnaces, and therefore stop importing raw materials from abroad. They also want to know where those supplies are coming from and how Tata is able to track their movements throughout the supply chain.\nThe British government is hoping that the fact that Tata does not import any of the raw steel from China will persuade the Trump administration to include all British exports in the deal.\nStarmer is sending his business adviser Varun Chandra to lead a delegation to Washington next week, and officials say they are confident of striking a final deal next month.\nThe Chinese ownership of British Steel, which has a separate plant at Scunthorpe, is understood not to be an issue since the government took over its management.\nAlasdair McDiarmid, the assistant general secretary of the steel industry union Community, said on Tuesday: \u201cIt is now absolutely vital that a deal for steel is secured as soon as possible. Our steel producers and their US customers need an end to the current state of uncertainty to allow normal business to resume.\n\u201cCrucially, we must see a full exemption for all UK steel exports to the US \u2013 without that guarantee, some of our leading steel businesses could be left behind, with a threat to jobs and livelihoods.\u201d\nA government source said: \u201cThanks to our agreement with the US, the UK is the only country in the world to be exempt from the 50% tariff on steel and aluminium that other countries now face.\n\u201cYesterday the US president confirmed his intention to work with the UK to remove the 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium, helping us to ensure they can be implemented as soon as possible and in the best interests of the UK industry.\u201d\nAdditional reporting by Peter Walker in Banff", "\u2018Vital\u2019 that British steel gets Trump tariff deal after UK-US trade pact, say unions. Steel trade unions have said it is \u201cabsolutely vital\u201d that the UK rapidly secures a deal to protect the sector from Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs, after the industry was excluded from an initial UK-US pact signed on Monday night.\nKeir Starmer and Trump signed off a UK-US trade deal at the G7 summit in Canada, with the US president saying Britain would have protection against future tariffs \u201cbecause I like them\u201d.\nThe car industry was relieved that tariffs on the sector will be reduced to 10% from 27.5%. The UK aerospace sector will face no tariffs at all from the US after deal, which followed an initial agreement made in May.\nHowever, the announcement of the deal did not include the removal of tariffs on steel imports. UK steelmakers still face 25% tariffs, although this is lower than the global tariff of 50% imposed by the Trump administration on other nations.\nThe UK business department said the two leaders had pledged to \u201cmake progress towards 0% tariffs on core steel products as agreed\u201d.\nAlasdair McDiarmid, the assistant general secretary of the steel union Community, welcomed the progress that has been made on reaching a deal on steel.\n\u201cHowever, it\u2019s now absolutely vital that a deal for steel is secured as soon as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cOur steel producers and their US customers need an end to the current state of uncertainty to allow normal business to resume.\n\u201cCrucially, we must see a full exemption for all UK steel exports to the US \u2013 without that guarantee some of our leading steel businesses could be left behind, with a threat to jobs and livelihoods.\u201d\nA steel industry source said the automotive deal had been widely expected to be completed before steel and aluminium. However, the person said \u201cwe now need steel to happen pretty quickly\u201d to avoid the risk of 50% tariffs kicking in on 9 July, under the terms of the UK\u2019s temporary exemption.\nGareth Stace, the director general of the trade body UK Steel, said: \u201cWe look forward to imminently benefiting from a tariff rate cut similar to that which the automotive and aerospace industries will enjoy in seven days. The UK steel industry badly needs clarification over the \u2018melted and poured\u2019 requirement, and the level of quotas available to UK steelmakers so that we can restore the historical trade routes that have served both the UK and the US economies for many years.\u201d\nMinisters have been working to ensure the UK\u2019s biggest steelmaker, Tata Steel, is included in tariff-free access to the US. Its bosses fear the deal could end up excluding Indian-owned Tata Steel, which runs the vast Port Talbot steelworks in south Wales, because of the origin of some of its products. The company exports more than $100m (\u00a374m) worth of goods to the US every year.\nThe Chinese ownership of British Steel, which is under government control, could be a sticking point in a deal for the industry as the executive order signed by Trump suggests the US wants assurances that the metal originates in the UK.\n\u201cThe UK also committed to working to meet American requirements on the security of the supply chains of steel and aluminium products intended for export to the US and on the nature of ownership of relevant production facilities,\u201d the order states.\nSeparately, British Steel has secured a new five-year supply contract with Network Rail worth more than \u00a3500m, under which British Steel will supply between 70,000 and 80,000 tonnes of rail a year. McDiarmid welcomed the extension but expressed concern that \u201cBritish Steel\u2019s share of the Network Rail contract is set to reduce significantly\u201d.\nMike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme he hoped the new 10% tariff rate for UK carmakers would start \u201cin the next few days\u201d.\nThe UK-US trade pact had been negotiated in early May, \u201cbut we\u2019ve been waiting for it to be implemented so manufacturers can start shipping without being subject to those punitive tariffs\u201d, he said.\nHe added that \u201ca lot less\u201d had been exported to the US in the meantime, and some UK manufacturers had halted shipments. The British luxury carmakers Jaguar Land Rover and Bentley are among those that paused shipments.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been pausing because their customers \u2013 we\u2019ve got shrewd customers \u2013 were going to wait and see what was going to happen,\u201d Hawes said. \u201cYou could see that the cost to the ultimate consumer was going to come down because of the reduction in the tariff, but you just didn\u2019t know when.\u201d", "Trump says UK is protected from tariffs \u2018because I like them\u2019 as trade deal is signed off. Keir Starmer and Donald Trump have signed off a UK-US trade deal at the G7 summit in Canada, with the US president saying Britain would have protection against future tariffs \u201cbecause I like them\u201d.\nThe two leaders presented the deal, which covers aerospace and the auto sector, at the G7 venue in Kananaskis, Alberta.\nWhen reporters asked about steel, Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to let you have that information in a little while.\u201d\nUnder details released by the Department for Business and Trade, the UK aerospace sector will face no tariffs at all from the US, while the auto industry will have 10% tariffs, down from 25%.\nThe steel industry still faces 25% tariffs for now, although this is less than the US\u2019s global rate of 50% on steel and aluminium. The UK business department said the two leaders had pledged to \u201cmake progress towards 0% tariffs on core steel products as agreed\u201d.\nHowever, the US executive order implementing the deal highlighted a possible hiccup over steel tariffs. The US still wants assurances about the Chinese owners of British Steel.\nIn a paragraph setting out a future move to \u201cmost-favoured-nation rates for steel and aluminum articles\u201d, the order says the UK has \u201ccommitted to working to meet American requirements on the security of the supply chains of steel and aluminum products intended for export to the United States and on the nature of ownership of relevant production facilities\u201d.\nThis would seem to refer to US worries about Jingye Group, which owns British Steel even though the UK government took control of the company in April to stop Jingye closing its Scunthorpe plant. Trump\u2019s administration wants assurances that Jingye does not use British Steel as a way to circumvent US tariffs.\nA full version of the deal first outlined in May had been seen as imminent, but Downing Street will be particularly happy to have it finalised at the summit, with full endorsement from a cheerful Trump \u2013 even if he did wrongly say the deal was with the EU.\n\u201cI just signed it, and it\u2019s done. And so we have our trade agreement with the European Union, and it\u2019s a fair deal for both, and it produces a lot of jobs, a lot of income,\u201d Trump said.\n\u201cAnd we have many, many other ones coming. But you see, the level of enthusiasm is very good, but the relationship that we have is fantastic.\u201d\nAs has been his habit in recent meetings with Starmer, the mercurial president was warm in his praise for a fellow leader who is not a political soulmate. \u201cWe\u2019re very longtime partners and allies and friends, and we\u2019ve become friends in a short period of time. He\u2019s slightly more liberal than I am,\u201d Trump joked at one point.\nAsked if the UK was now protected from future tariffs, Trump said: \u201cThe UK is very well protected. You know why? Because I like them \u2013 that\u2019s their ultimate protection.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cThe prime minister has done a great job. I want to just tell that to the people of the United Kingdom. He\u2019s done a very, very good job. He\u2019s done what other people, they\u2019ve been talking about this deal for six years, and he\u2019s done what they haven\u2019t been able to do. So he\u2019s done really a very good job.\u201d\nThe comments came just before the pair met for talks at the G7 event, where Starmer was poised to push the US president for new sanctions against Russia and to help end the war between Iran and Israel.\nIn a separate announcement late on Monday, Downing Street said it expected further sanctions on Moscow to be set out at the summit, seeking to \u201cratchet up pressure until Russia is ready to commit to a full and unconditional ceasefire\u201d.

In a recent study, researchers found more pediatric firearm deaths in states with looser gun laws. (Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)\nMore American children and teens die from firearms than any other cause, but there are more deaths \u2014 and wider racial disparities \u2014 in states with more permissive gun policies, according to a new study.\nThe study, published in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics last week, analyzes trends in state firearm policies and kids\u2019 deaths since 2010, after the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in McDonald v. City of Chicago. The ruling struck down the city\u2019s handgun ban, clearing the way for many states to make it easier for people to buy and carry guns.\nThe study authors split states into three groups: \u201cmost permissive,\u201d \u201cpermissive\u201d and \u201cstrict,\u201d based on the stringency of their firearm policies. Those policies include safe storage laws, background checks and so-called Stand Your Ground laws. The researchers analyzed homicide and suicide rates and the children\u2019s race.\nUsing statistical methods, the researchers calculated 6,029 excess deaths in the most permissive states between 2011 and 2023, compared with the number of deaths that would have been expected under the states\u2019 pre-McDonald rules. There were 1,424 excess deaths in the states in the middle category.\nIn total, about 17,000 deaths were expected in the post-decision period, but 23,000 occurred, said lead author Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston, in an interview.\nAmong the eight states with the strictest laws, four \u2014 California, Maryland, New York and Rhode Island \u2014 saw statistically significant decreases in their pediatric firearm death rates. Illinois, which was directly affected by the court\u2019s decision in the McDonald case, and Connecticut saw increases in their rates. In Massachusetts and New Jersey, the changes were not statistically significant.\nThe rate increased in all but four (Alaska, Arizona, Nebraska and South Dakota) of the 41 states in the two permissive categories. (Hawaii was not included in the study due its low rates of firearm deaths.)\nNon-Hispanic Black children and teens saw the largest increase in firearm deaths in the 41 states with looser gun laws. Those youths\u2019 mortality rates increased, but by a much smaller amount, in the states with strict laws.\nExperts say the study underscores the power of policy to help prevent firearm deaths among children and teens. The analysis comes less than a month after the release of a federal report on children\u2019s health that purported to highlight the drivers of poor health in America\u2019s children but failed to include anything on firearm injuries \u2014 the leading cause of death for children and teens in 2020 and 2021, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nTrauma surgeon Dr. Marie Crandall, chair of surgery at MetroHealth medical center and a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, researches gun violence. She previously practiced at a Jacksonville, Florida, urban trauma unit, where she frequently saw children and teens caught in gun violence.\n\u201cWhen I see children come in with 10 holes in them that I can\u2019t save \u2014 that is a loss. That is a completely preventable death, and it is deeply emotionally scarring to have to have those conversations with families when we know, as a society, there are things we could do to de-escalate,\u201d said Crandall, who wasn\u2019t involved in the new study.\nWhen I see children come in with 10 holes in them that I can't save \u2014 that is a loss. That is a completely preventable death.\n\u2013 Dr. Marie Crandall MetroHealth medical center chief of surgery, Cleveland\nIn her state of Ohio, firearm death rates among children and teens increased from 1.6 per 100,000 kids in the decade before the McDonald decision to 2.8 after it, according to the study. Ohio was categorized in the group with the most permissive laws.\nThe study adds to previous research that shows state laws around child access to firearms, such as safe storage and background checks, tend to be associated with fewer child firearm deaths.\n\u201cWe know that child access prevention decreases unintentional injuries and suicides of children. So having your firearms locked, unloaded, stored separately from ammunition, decreases the likelihood of childhood injuries,\u201d Crandall said. \u201cMore stringent regulation of those things also decreases childhood injuries.\u201d\nBut she said it\u2019s hard to be optimistic about more stringent regulation when the current administration dismisses gun violence as a public health emergency. The Trump administration earlier this year took down an advisory from the former U.S. surgeon general, issued last year, that emphasized gun violence as a public health crisis.\nFaust, the lead author of the new study, stressed that firearm injuries and deaths were notably missing from the Make America Healthy Again Commission report on children\u2019s health. He said the failure to include them illustrates the politicization of a major public health emergency for America\u2019s kids.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to take them seriously if they\u2019re omitting the leading cause of death,\u201d Faust said. \u201cThey\u2019re whiffing, they\u2019re shanking. They\u2019re deciding on a political basis not to do it. I would say by omitting it, they\u2019re politicizing it.\u201d\nFaust and pediatric trauma surgeon Dr. Chethan Sathya, who directs the Center for Gun Violence Prevention at the Northwell Health system in New York, each pointed to the development of car seat laws and public health education, as examples of preventive strategies that helped reduce childhood fatalities. They support a similar approach to curbing youth gun deaths.\n\u201cWe really have to apply a public health framework to this issue, not a political one, and we\u2019ve done that with other issues in the past,\u201d said Sathya, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study and oversees his hospital\u2019s firearm injury prevention programs. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that this is a public health issue.\u201d\nIn Louisiana, which the study categorized as one of the 30 most permissive states, the child firearm mortality rate increased from 4.1 per 100,000 kids in the pre-McDonald period to 5.7 after it \u2014 the nation\u2019s highest rate. The study period only goes to 2023, but the state last year enacted a permitless carry law, allowing people to carry guns in public without undergoing background checks. And just last month, Louisiana legislators defeated a bill that would have created the crime of improper firearm storage.\nLouisiana Democratic state Rep. Matthew Willard, who sponsored the safe storage legislation, said during the floor debate that its purpose was to protect children. Louisiana had the highest rate of unintentional shootings by children between 2015 to 2022, according to the research arm of Everytown for Gun Safety, which advocates for stricter gun access. Willard cited that statistic on the floor.\nBut Republican opponents said Willard\u2019s proposal would infringe on residents\u2019 gun rights and make it more difficult for them to use guns in self-defense.\n\u201cNobody needs to come in our houses and tell us what to do with our guns. I think this is ridiculous,\u201d Republican Rep. R. Dewith Carrier said during the debate.\nAnother Republican opponent, state Rep. Troy Romero, said he was concerned that having a firearm locked away would make it harder for an adult to quickly access it.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s behind a locked drawer, how in the world are you going, at 2 or 3 in the morning, going to be able to protect your family if somebody intrudes or comes into your home?\u201d Romero said.\nGun violence researcher Julia Fleckman, an assistant professor, and her team at Tulane University in New Orleans have started to collect data on the impact of the state\u2019s permitless carry law.\n\u201cIt places a disproportionate impact on really vulnerable people, really, our most vulnerable people,\u201d Fleckman said, noting kids bear the brunt of legislators\u2019 decisions. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a lot of control over this or the decisions we\u2019re making.\u201d\nIn South Carolina, another one of the most permissive states, the mortality rate increased from 2.3 to 3.9 per 100,000 kids in the time before and after the McDonald decision. South Carolina Democratic state Rep. JA Moore, who lost his adult sister in the 2015 racist shooting that killed nine at a Charleston church, said state policy alone isn\u2019t enough. He implored his colleagues to also examine their perception of guns.\n\u201cWe have a culture here in South Carolina that doesn\u2019t lend itself to a more safe South Carolina,\u201d said Moore, who added he\u2019s been advocating for background checks and stricter carry laws. \u201cThere is a need for a culture change in our state, in our country, when it comes to guns and our relationships with guns as Americans, realizing that these are deadly weapons.\u201d\nAnd investing in safer neighborhoods is crucial, he said.\n\u201cPeople are hurt by guns in places that they\u2019re more comfortable, like their homes in their own neighborhoods,\u201d he said.\nCommunity-based interventions are important to stemming violence, experts said. Crandall, the Cleveland surgeon, said there\u2019s emerging evidence that hospital-based and community-based violence prevention programs decrease the likelihood of violent and firearm-related injury.\nSuch programs aim to break cycles of violence by connecting injured patients with community engagement services.

Austrian school shooter planned attack in detail but motive unclear, police say\nOfficials say the former student who killed nine students and a teacher at a school in Austria and then took his own life planned the attack in detail\nGRAZ, Austria -- The former student who killed nine students and a teacher at a school in Austria and then took his own life planned the attack in detail, but he appears to have shot his victims at random and investigators still haven't been able to ascertain his motive, officials said Thursday.\nThe 21-year-old had left the BORG Dreiersch\u00fctzengasse high school in Graz three years ago, breaking off his studies after attending for three years, police said. They said they knew of no personal connection between the gunman and the students he shot, but that one of the two teachers he shot had once taught him. They were still investigating whether that was a factor.\nThe attack prompted Austria to declare three days of national mourning, and large numbers of candles have been laid in Graz's main square and outside the school.\nThe assailant, an Austrian who lived with his mother near Graz and whom officials have declined to identify, used a Mercury double-barreled shotgun and a Glock 19 handgun in the shooting. Michael Lohnegger, the head of Styria province's criminal police office, said that he arrived at the school Tuesday morning with a backpack containing the weapons, and put on equipment including shooting glasses and a headset in a bathroom before starting a roughly seven-minute shooting spree.\nHe opened fire indiscriminately on the building's third floor before shooting open the locked door of a fourth-floor classroom and again firing indiscriminately, Lohnegger told a news conference. Lohnegger said that he had enough ammunition to continue shooting and it was unclear why he hadn't; the assailant then returned to the bathroom and shot himself fatally in the head.\nA search of his home uncovered a farewell letter and video, which Lohnegger said added up to \u201can apology directed to his family for the crime and a general thank-you,\u201d but offered no \u201cindication for a motive.\u201d\nThey also found a handwritten note that showed he had planned the attack \u201cdown to the smallest detail\" \u2014 setting out how he would proceed, but giving no date for the crime. It suggested that he had lacked enough time to build a fully functional pipe bomb, and investigators found one that wouldn't have worked.\nLohnegger said a picture had emerged of \u201ca very introverted person\u201d who largely didn't take part in real-world activities, and that his great passion was taking part in online first-person shooter games.\n\u201cBut even here, there is no information from his personal surroundings that he ever expressed any anger or resentment toward the school, students or teachers,\u201d he added. The man had no previous police record and \u201cthere were definitely no particular problems with him at this school.\u201d\nThe shooter was in unspecified vocational training at the time of the attack, investigators said.\nHe had bought the shotgun legally in Graz in early April, and the handgun from another shop in the city in late May. He had a license to own weapons that required a report from a psychological expert, which apparently was produced in March.\nStarting in March, he took part in shooting practice five times at a shooting club in Graz, using a hired firearm, Lohnegger said.\nThe slain students were six girls and three boys aged between 14 and 17. Eleven people were wounded in the attack, and authorities said on Wednesday that their lives weren't in danger.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Geir Moulson in Berlin contributed to this report."]}, {"topic": 65, "name": "Newsom vs Trump", "keywords": "newsom, california, trump, gavin, trumps, he, governor, guard, his, angeles", "documents": ["Gavin Newsom locks horns with Trump in a politically defining moment. Amid immigration raids, peaceful protests, attacks on law enforcement officers and the threat of his own arrest by federal agents, California Gov. Gavin Newsom is immersed in what could be the most consequential political fight of his career.\nThe battle between the president and the governor of the country\u2019s largest state instantly turned Newsom into the face of resistance to President Donald Trump\u2019s expansive interpretation of the authorities of his office and mass-deportation campaign. Newsom, who is a potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, has been taking heavy criticism from within his own party over his efforts \u2014 in part through his new podcast \u2014 to cast himself in the role of conciliator.\nNewsom delivered an address Tuesday night that aimed squarely at Trump and was clearly intended for a national audience.\n\"This isn't just about protests here in Los Angeles,\" he said. \"When Donald Trump sought blanket authority to commander the National Guard, he made that order apply to every state in this nation. This is about all of us. This is about you. California may be first, but it clearly will not end here. Other states are next. Democracy is next. Democracy is under assault before our eyes. This moment we have feared has arrived.\"\n\u201cFor someone like Newsom, the balance is: Is he able to be tough enough? Will he stand up to Trump? How does he lead at this moment?\u201d said Democratic strategist Karen Finney. \u201cThis is unprecedented. There\u2019s not a right answer. So far, he\u2019s doing the right things, being clear, consistent, clear communication.\u201d\nNewsom could try to turn the situation on Trump by pointing to government overreach, but at the same time, there is real risk of an eruption violence from rogue actors, said Matt Bennett, co-founder of Third Way, a center-left think tank.\n\u201cThe images of the militarization of this for no reason should be enough for Newsom to win this debate as long as they can keep control of the worst of the violence,\" he said.\n\u201cTrump always goes too far,\u201d Bennett added. \u201cLast time, he went too far with the Muslim ban. Then he really went too far with child separation \u2014 those images really hurt Trump. Here, it\u2019s a real question. It\u2019s a much closer call this time. We just don\u2019t know yet.\u201d\nAs it is, Newsom must balance forces that are both inside and outside of his control. That includes competing with messaging from Trump (who frequently refers to the governor as \"Newscum\") and the president's top lieutenants, who are ever-present on cable news, social media and political podcasts. And it involves attempting to quell violent actors while pointing to Trump's actions \u2014 which have included deploying the U.S. Marines \u2014 as an overreach.\nThe White House maintains it is winning the public relations battle, with officials tapping a refrain this week that it was the fight they wanted replete with made-for-TV images. They included images of billowing black smoke and Waymo vehicles that protesters had set on fire.\nOn Monday, California sued Trump for using emergency powers to deploy National Guard troops to the Los Angeles area over the weekend. Trump, citing a statute that allows the president to activate the guard to repel a foreign invasion or quell a rebellion, accused Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass of failing to protect federal agents and property from demonstrators.\nNewsom has slammed the step as escalatory and said existing law enforcement could have handled any violence or destruction. He argued that the move was \u201cpurposefully inflammatory and will only escalate tensions\u201d and that there was \u201ccurrently no unmet need.\u201d\nNewsom has also been mounting his own messaging offensive, including on X, where he posted what appeared to be photos of troops crowded on a floor, apparently attempting to rest.\n\"You sent your troops here without fuel, food, water or a place to sleep. Here they are \u2014 being forced to sleep on the floor, piled on top of one another. If anyone is treating our troops disrespectfully, it is you @realDonaldTrump,\" Newsom said on X.\nOn Sunday, Newsom chided Trump \"border czar\" Tom Homan, saying in an MSNBC interview: \"Tom, arrest me. Let\u2019s go.\"\nLate Monday, Newsom sat for a \"Pod Save America\" podcast recording in which he cast Trump's actions as unconstitutional and said some of those assigned to Los Angeles \u2014 in his view, unnecessarily \u2014 were pried away from fentanyl investigations, and potentially from border operations, for \"this theatrical display of toughness by a president of the United States who is unhinged.\"\nBy Tuesday morning, Newsom accused Trump and his top White House deportation architect Stephen Miller of sheltering insurrectionists.\n\"The only people defending insurrectionists are you and @realDonaldTrump. Or, are we pretending like you didn\u2019t pardon 1500 of them?\"\nOn Tuesday afternoon, the two were locked in another public squabble after Trump told reporters he delivered some tough words to Newsom in a phone call Monday. Newsom said the two hadn't spoken since Friday, then posted an interview with NBC News from over the weekend in which Newsom contended he and Trump had a pleasant conversation and that the president barely talked about the issue at hand.\nThe White House had a different take.\n\u201cThe President called Gavin Newsom to tell him to get his ass in gear,\" White House spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement. \"The only liar here is Newsom who continues to fail his state as he prioritizes doing interviews with leftist media to gaslight the public instead of helping his state.\u201d\nAt that, Newsom responded on X: \"Donald Trump is a stone cold liar.\"\nSince November's presidential election, Newsom seemed content to lie low and get a better measure of Trump's political appeal as he contemplated a run for the Oval Office. He has also taken some heat from his own party for hosting MAGA figures on his podcast and saying he opposes allowing trans athletes on girls' teams in college and youth sports.\nTrump's move on the protests, however, has forced Newsom to pick sides on an issue that the president and White House officials believe they have the political edge.\nNow, Democratic leaders say their party is galvanizing behind Newsom \u2014 at least for the moment \u2014 and it would be difficult for prospective rivals to do anything but fall in line behind him when he is taking a stand on turf that is popular with Democratic voters.\nFriends of Newsom say it would be an unexpected political boon for the governor if Trump and Homan follow through on their threat to arrest him if they decide he has broken the law.\nThat would be \"a Nelson Mandela moment\" for Newsom, said one longtime ally, referring to the imprisonment of the anti-apartheid leader and recalling that indictments helped Trump win the 2024 Republican presidential nomination.\nAt the same time, that ally and others are careful to depict the governor as focused on the substance of the battle with Trump, rather than the political risks or rewards.\n\"He's not going to stand by idly while President Trump aims to destroy California,\" said California state Rep. Buffy Wicks, a Democrat who often aligns with Newsom. \"I do not think it's a political calculation. It's genuinely how he feels, and he's leading with his heart on it.\"\nAnother observer had a different take: \u201cThis whole fiasco could make Gavin president,\u201d Anthony Scaramucci, the short-lived White House communications director in Trump\u2019s first term, wrote Monday on X.\nThe obvious pitfall for Newsom is that Trump could take credit for restoring order or, if violence escalates, continue to pour blame on him. Democrats in the state say that they believe Trump is intentionally sowing discord and that Newsom's best political move is to do his job well.\n\"The most important thing he can do is show he can manage a crisis,\" said Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif. \"Good governance is always the best politics \u2014 to just show competence contrasting with Trump\u2019s chaos.\"\nTrump has deployed 700 Marines to Los Angeles to support the roughly 300 National Guard members already on the ground. The president had already ordered the deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops. It remains to be seen how the courts will come down on California's lawsuit.\nThe relevant law allows the president to activate the National Guard domestically in order to quell a foreign invasion or a rebellion against the U.S. government, and Trump, calling protesters \"insurrectionists,\" declared the demonstrations a \"rebellion.\"\nThe California attorney general argues in the lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in Northern California, that Trump has illegally usurped the authority of the state by fabricating a rebellion and that the presence of guard forces is exacerbating tension between protesters and law enforcement officers.\nThe powers to deploy the National Guard are divided between presidents and governors, with state executives generally controlling when they are activated within their own state \u2014 as opposed to being deployed to foreign wars.\nFormer Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, said in an interview with NBC News that governors routinely work with the White House, regardless of party, to mobilize National Guard forces for a variety of tasks, including the response to natural disasters. At times, governors have asked presidents to deploy guard forces to restore order in their states during riots. But not since the Civil Rights era has a president called up the National guard to enforce the law over the objection of the state's governor.\nDemocrats say that it's up to state and local law enforcement to keep the peace and that there was no need for Trump to federalize troops \u2014 especially without the consent of the governor.\n\"Gavin's mad as hell and he should be,\" McAuliffe said. \"This is the governor's responsibility, not the president's.\"\nBennett flagged concerns about introducing the U.S. Marines into the situation, saying they are not trained in controlling crowds of Americans.\n\u201cThis is a very, very dangerous thing,\" Bennett said. \"God forbid, if they hurt somebody \u2026 that\u2019s real trouble for Trump. But [we\u2019re] not rooting for that.\u201d", "Standoff with troops in Los Angeles reignites old feud as Newsom resists Trump's immigration raids. Standoff with troops in Los Angeles reignites old feud as Newsom resists Trump's immigration raids\nAn escalating clash pits a Republican president looking to fulfill his mass deportation goals against a Democratic governor with White House aspirations hoping to mobilize opposition\nWASHINGTON -- It was earlier this year that California Gov. Gavin Newsom was making nice with President Donald Trump as he sought help for his wildfire-battered state and moderating his approach ahead of a potential bid for the White House.\nBut now the gloves are off after Trump took the extraordinary step of federalizing the National Guard in Los Angeles over Newsom\u2019s objections and the governor responded by suing the administration, alleging abuse of power that marked an \u201cunmistakable step toward authoritarianism.\u201d\nThe escalating clash pits the leader of the Republican Party against a Democrat with ambitions of leading his own party, with a striking backdrop of a domestic troop deployment meant to control a city in unrest and now to assist in arresting migrants \u2014 the centerpiece of the president\u2019s agenda.\nFor Trump, it\u2019s another chance to battle with Newsom, a frequent foil who leads a heavily Democratic state the president has long criticized. And for Newsom, the feud has handed him a national platform as a beleaguered Democratic Party seeks a leader able to resist Trump.\n\u201cHe has shown he\u2019s not going to be intimidated, and we\u2019re all for that,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said of Newsom on Wednesday.\nConservative commentator Ben Shapiro, a former California resident, said Newsom's motivations for taking on Trump are clear.\n\u201cThis is all about Gavin Newsom running for president in 2028, and what he is hoping is that becoming the face of a resistance to Trump is going to jog him to victory in Democratic primaries,\u201d he said in his podcast \u201cThe Ben Shapiro Show.\u201d\nTrump has long been a foe of California, which overwhelmingly rejected him in all three of his presidential campaigns.\nOver the years, Trump has threatened to intercede in the state's long-running homeless crisis, vowed to withhold federal wildfire aid as political leverage in a dispute over water rights, called on police to shoot people robbing stores and warned residents \u201cyour children are in danger\u201d because of illegal immigration.\nAs a candidate in 2023, Trump said California was once a symbol of American prosperity but is \u201cbecoming a symbol of our nation\u2019s decline.\u201d\n\u201cThis is not a great state anymore. This is a dumping ground,\u201d Trump said at the time. \u201cThe world is being dumped into California. Prisoners. Terrorists. Mental patients.\u201d\nNewsom would learn to balance the dueling imperatives of a governor who needs to work with the federal government with being one of the Democratic Party's most prominent figures.\nAs governor-elect, Newsom joined Trump in November 2018 as the then-president viewed wildfire damage in Paradise, California, and they pledged to put aside political differences to help the community recover. He was also overly complimentary of the Trump administration's assistance to California during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, praising Trump's \u201cfocus on treatments\u201d for the virus and thanking him for sending masks and gloves to his state.\nBut Newsom was also a top surrogate for Democrats in the 2024 campaign and frequently warned of the consequences of Trump's return to the White House.\nThere was a handshake and a warm pat on the back.\nNewsom was there on the tarmac in Los Angeles in January, welcoming Trump and first lady Melania Trump, who had traveled west to survey the damage from the deadly wildfires in Southern California.\nThen they spoke to reporters together, pledging cooperation to rebuild the area and appreciating each other's presence.\n\u201cYou were there for us during COVID. I don\u2019t forget that,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cAnd I have all the expectations that we\u2019ll be able to work together to get this speedy recovery.\u201d\nTrump added: \u201cWe will. We\u2019re going to get it done.\u201d\nNewsom also traveled to Washington in February to press Trump and lawmakers for more federal wildfire relief. The governor called his meeting with Trump \u201cproductive\u201d and one that was marked with a \u201cspirit of collaboration and cooperation.\u201d\nThe cordial attitude was part of Newsom\u2019s unmistakable appeal to the center, painting himself as a pragmatist to reach out to those who had fled from a party that had just lost all battleground states in the 2024 presidential election.\nNewsom spoke to conservative allies of Trump on a new podcast the governor billed as a way for Democrats to learn from the political successes of Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement. He voiced opposition to transgender athletes participating in female sports while shifting focus away from efforts in Sacramento to \u201cTrump-proof\u201d California \u2014 which Newsom embarked on after Trump\u2019s victory in November \u2014 as the wildfires raged.\nIn an April interview with YouTube commentator Brian Tyler Cohen, Newsom acknowledged Trump\u2019s ability to appeal to the public.\n\u201cHis success is his ability to win every damn news cycle and get us distracted and moving in 25 different directions,\u201d he said.\nThe Democratic governor and Trump have been feuding publicly about the response to protests, with Newsom claiming Trump didn't warn him he'd deploy troops in a Friday phone call and Trump claiming the conversation was about that.\nNewsom has taunted Trump administration officials with arresting him, and Trump first appeared receptive to the idea and then walked back earlier remarks.\nAfter Newsom filed an emergency request in federal court Tuesday to block the Trump administration from using the National Guard and Marines to assist with immigration raids in Los Angeles, he gave a public address accusing Trump of going beyond arresting criminals.\n\u201cCalifornia may be first, but it clearly will not end here,\u201d he warned. \u201cOther states are next. Democracy is next. Democracy is under assault before our eyes.\u201d\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt dismissed Newsom's speech as performative.\n\u201cI know Gavin Newsom had a big address to the nation last night \u2014 I guess he thought that\u2019s what it was for maybe his future political ambitions,\u201d Leavitt said Wednesday. \u201cBut he spoke a lot of words. We haven\u2019t seen action.\u201d\nThe filing this week wasn\u2019t the first time this year that California had sued the Trump administration. In April, Newsom filed a lawsuit that challenged Trump\u2019s authority to impose sweeping tariffs that the governor asserted would inflate prices and inflict billions of dollars in damage to California, which has the nation\u2019s largest economy.\nAnd California \u2014 not just Newsom \u2014 continues to be a foil.\nJust this month, the Trump administration signaled that it intends to cut off federal funding for a long-delayed California high-speed rail project plagued by multibillion-dollar cost overruns.

Trump's mass deportations leave Democrats more ready to fight back\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom looked straight into the camera and offered a stark moment for his Democratic Party\nWASHINGTON -- California Gov. Gavin Newsom looked straight into the camera and staked out a clear choice for his Democratic Party.\nThe governor positioned himself as not only a leader of the opposition to President Donald Trump\u2019s mass deportation agenda, but a de facto champion of the immigrants now being rounded up in California and across the country. Many of them, he said in the video address, were not hardened criminals, but hard-working people scooped up at a Home Depot lot or a garment factory, and detained by masked agents assisted by National Guard troops.\nIt\u2019s a politically charged position for the party to take, after watching voter discontent with illegal immigration fuel Trump's return to the White House. It leaves Democrats deciding how strongly to align with that message in the face of blistering criticism from Republicans who are pouring billions of dollars into supporting Trump\u2019s strict immigration campaign.\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said Wednesday he's proud of Newsom, \u201che\u2019s refusing to be intimidated by Donald Trump.\u201d\nFrom the streets of Los Angeles to the halls of Congress, the debate over Trump\u2019s mass deportation agenda is forcing the U.S. to reckon with core values as a nation of immigrants, but also its long-standing practice of allowing migrants to live and work in the U.S. in a gray zone while not granting them full legal status. More than 11 million immigrants are in the U.S. without proper approval, with millions more having arrived with temporary protections.\nAs Trump\u2019s administration promises to round up some 3,000 immigrants a day and deport 1 million a year, the political stakes are shifting in real time. The president rode to the White House with his promise of mass deportations \u2014 rally crowds echoed his campaign promise to \u201cbuild the wall.\u201d But Americans are watching as Trump deploys the National Guard and active U.S. Marines to Los Angeles, while pockets of demonstrations erupt in other cities nationwide, including after agents raided a meat processing plant in Omaha, Nebraska\nJoel Payne, a Democratic strategist, said the country\u2019s mood appears to be somewhere between then-President Barack Obama\u2019s assertion that America is \u201ca nation of immigrants, we\u2019re also a nation of laws\u201d and Trump\u2019s \u201cmore aggressive\u201d deportation approach.\n\u201cDemocrats still have some work to do to be consistently trustworthy messengers on the issue,\u201d he said.\nAt the same time, he said, Trump\u2019s actions as a \u201cchaos agent\u201d on immigration when there's already unrest over his trade wars and economic uncertainty, risk overreaching if the upheaval begins to sow havoc in the lives of Americans.\nRepublicans have been relentless in their attacks on Democrats, portraying the situation in Los Angeles, which has been largely confined to a small area downtown, in highly charged terms as \u201criots,\u201d in a preview of campaign ads to come.\nPolice said more than 200 people were detained for failing to disperse on Tuesday, and 17 others for violating the 8 p.m. curfew over part of Los Angeles. Police arrested several more people for possessing a firearm, assaulting a police officer and other violations. Two people have been charged for allegedly throwing Molotov cocktails toward police during LA protests.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson said Newsom should be \u201ctarred and feathered\u201d for his leadership in the state, which he called \u201ca safe haven to violent criminal illegal aliens.\u201d\nAt a private meeting of House Republicans this week with White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, Rep. Richard Hudson, the chairman of the GOP\u2019s campaign arm, framed the situation as Democrats supporting rioting and chaos while Republicans stand for law and order.\n\u201cViolent insurrectionists turned areas of Los Angeles into lawless hellscapes over the weekend,\u201d wrote Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., earlier this week in the Wall Street Journal, suggesting it may be time to send in military troops.\n\u201cThe American people elected Donald Trump and a Republican Congress to secure our border and deport violent illegal aliens. That\u2019s exactly what the president is doing.\u201d\nBut not all rank-and-file Republicans are on board with such a heavy-handed approach.\nGOP Rep, David Valadao, who represents California's agriculture regions in the Central Valley, said on social media he remains \u201cconcerned about ongoing ICE operations throughout CA\u201d and was urging the administration \u201cto prioritize the removal of known criminals over the hardworking people who have lived peacefully in the Valley for years.\u201d\nHeading into the 2026 midterm election season, with control of the House and Senate at stake, it's a repeat of past political battles, as Congress has failed repeatedly to pass major immigration law changes.\nThe politics have shifted dramatically from the Obama era, when his administration took executive action to protect young immigrants known as Dreamers under the landmark Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.\nThose days, lawmakers were considering proposals to beef up border security as part of a broader package that would also create legal pathways, including for citizenship, for immigrants who have lived in the country for years and paid taxes, some filling roles in jobs Americans won't always take.\nWith Trump\u2019s return to the Oval Office, the debate has turned toward aggressively removing immigrants, including millions who were allowed to legally enter the U.S. during the Biden administration, as they await their immigration hearings and proceedings.\n\u201cThis anniversary should be a reminder,\u201d said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., at a Wednesday event at the U.S. Capitol championing DACA\u2019s 13th year, even as protections are at risk under Trump\u2019s administration. \u201cImmigration has many faces.\u201d\nDespite their challenges in last year's election, Democrats feel more emboldened to resist Trump's actions than even just a few months ago, but the political conversation has nonetheless shifted in Trump's direction.\nWhile Democrats are unified against Trump's big tax breaks bill, with its $150 billion for new detention facilities, deportation flights and 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, they talk more openly about beefing up border security and detaining the most dangerous criminal elements.\nRep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, points to the example of Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi, who won a special election in New York last year when he addressed potential changes to the immigration system head-on. At one point, he crashed a GOP opponent\u2019s news conference with his own.\n\u201cTrump said he was going to go after the worst of the worst, but he has ignored the laws, ignored due process, ignored the courts \u2014 and the American people reject that,\u201d she told The Associated Press.\n\u201cPeople want a president and a government that is going to fight for the issues that matter most to them, fight to move our country forward,\u201d she said. \u201cThey want a Congress that is going to be a coequal branch of government and a check on this president.\u201d\n___\nAssociated Press writer Matt Brown contributed to this story."]}, {"topic": 66, "name": "ADHD and Emotional Regulation Techniques", "keywords": "body, sleep, derosa, can, you, pain, adhd, massage, roller, or", "documents": ["If You Deal With Pain From Sciatica, An Expert Says These Products May Help. If you deal with pain or discomfort from sciatica, you\u2019re not alone. Up to 40% of people in the U.S. experience the condition at some point in their lives.\nCharacterized by irritation of the sciatic nerve in the lower back (or lumbar spine) region, sciatica \u201cusually feels like a deep throbbing pain that radiates from the back or buttocks,\u201d said physical therapist Chris DeRosa. DeRosa, who is a co-owner of Los Angeles-based Davis and DeRosa Physical Therapy, specializes in lower back pain and sciatica, among other issues.\nSciatica-related pain often continues down the leg and can travel as far as one\u2019s toes, DeRosa noted, and may be accompanied by numbness or tingling.\nAccording to DeRosa, because these symptoms are typically (though not always) muscular in origin, targeted exercises and physical therapy can be immensely helpful in improving sciatica and even resolving the condition completely.\n\u201cSciatica is 100% treatable in most cases, and your physical therapist is your best line of defense,\u201d DeRosa said. \u201cEspecially when symptoms first arise.\u201d\nDeRosa recommended some equipment that, in conjunction with proper exercises, can help assuage pain from sciatica. Before using any of the tools, be sure to consult with a physical therapist or doctor.\nGentle stretching with a dedicated nylon strap tool\nAccording to DeRosa, if a patient with sciatica has been clinically diagnosed with muscular symptoms, \"the piriformis muscle, or as I call it, the 'pain in butt muscle,' is usually the culprit.\"\n\"Sometimes, self-massage using a foam roller or massage gun/ball, followed by gentle stretching, can help with the symptoms and [be] part of our prescription for recovery,\" DeRosa said.\nDeRosa recommended this six-foot Stretch Out Strap for gently stretching the legs and upper and lower body. It's designed with 10 loops that help you stretch with greater control; you can also use the loops as comfy yet grippy handholds.\nThe tool also comes with a stretching exercise booklet and access to a video stretching guide.\nA supportive lower back brace with 40,000 5-star ratings\nIn addition, DeRosa recommended this popular back support belt, designed to soothe lower back pain through firm yet comfortable support.\nThe belted brace is made with breathable, flexible mesh, so it\u2019ll stabilize your back while still allowing for natural movement. You can also make use of its removable lumbar pad for days when you need additional stability and targeted compression.\nAnother plus, according to reviewers, is that the brace is subtle enough to wear under clothes if you prefer, lacking the bulkiness characteristic of other models.\nIt\u2019s available in three colors and in sizes XS-XXXL.\nClip the coupon for an additional discount at checkout.\nSelf-massaging, including with a vibration therapy massage ball\nDeRosa also recommended the Hyperice vibrating massage ball for gently massaging the piriformis muscle in your gluteal area.\nSmall enough to fit in your palm, the massage ball offers three vibration speeds to help soothe muscle stiffness and soreness.\nA budget-friendly foam roller for gentle exercise\nDeRosa also recommended this foam roller from Healthy You for gentle stretching and self-massaging.\nThe roller is made with medium-firm foam that's dense and durable yet slightly soft to the touch. It comes in three sizes, though DeRosa recommended the largest size (36 inches long).\nA reviewer-favorite roller that offers penetrating massages\nPer DeRosa's advice to invest in a foam roller, we think this textured massage roller is a good option for folks wanting the stretch of a roller and the precise targeting of a more specialized tool.\nThis \"next level\" medium-density foam roller is super popular among Amazon reviewers, who've given it 28,000 5-star ratings. It's designed with three zones so you can customize your self-massage: a \"palm\" area that mimics the feeling of a light massage; a \"finger\" zone created for tissue flushing and an especially intense \"thumb\" region with projecting nodes.\nOr an extra-textured roller for even more intensity\nIf you're seeking an especially intense massage, we think this deep tissue roller is a solid choice. The tool's firm textured bumps are supposed to deeply penetrate into muscles while the spaces in between allow for movement of your soft tissue.\nSomething of a hidden-gem recovery tool, the piece has earned 4.7 out of 5 stars on Amazon. \"It's amazing how much of a difference the Rumble Roller has made in my life,\" wrote one reviewer. \"The roller really helped 'loosen' things up and significantly decrease[d] the pain and stiffness that I was suffering from.\"\nThe roller is available in an \"original\" firm style and an extra-firm version. You can also grab it in several sizes.\nOr self-massage using specialized deep-massage tools\nIn addition, DeRosa suggested this trio of massage balls for massaging the gluteal area.\nDesigned to address muscle pain across the body, the rubber set includes a textured ball for targeting \"trigger\" points, a spiky ball for more intense tension relief and a firm, smooth ball for precise muscle massage.\nClip the coupon for an additional discount at checkout.\nA muscle-massaging ball you can use while standing\nBased on DeRosa's recommendation of self-massage balls, we think this mountable massage ball would be a good choice for anyone who'd prefer to stand up while working out knots.\nThis trigger point ball is designed to create an airtight seal against a smooth, non-porous wall, so you can target tense muscles more precisely without having to lie down.\nThe device is meant to be used for up to 30 minutes, after which you should unclamp the tool from your wall to preserve the tool's longevity and suction; the massage ball is not designed for permanent mounting.\nA handheld massage gun to relieve stiffness and tension\nDeRosa also suggested the Hyperice percussion massager for targeting muscles in the gluteal region.\nDesigned to loosen knots and soothe stiffness, the device has three speeds and two interchangeable heads (which you can swap out depending on your needs). Available in two colors, it's lightweight enough for you to carry with you and, according to reviewers, impressively quiet given its 40-watt motor.\nOr a unique heated back wrap with massage capability\nDeRosa also recommended Hyperice's heat and massage back wrap for soothing lower back pain.\nThe warming, vibrating wrap heats up six times faster than a standard heating pad, according to the brand, with an exceptionally large surface area that allows it to target discomfort more evenly and consistently than other options.\nYou can choose between three massage levels and three heat levels with the controller attached to the wrap. The device is made with comfy neoprene, which you can adjust to your desired level of compression.\nThe heated massager is also available in dedicated versions for legs and the right and left shoulders.\nA set of resistance bands with handles\n\u201cOur number one choice is usually resistance bands with handles,\u201d DeRosa explained to HuffPost. \u201cThey are cost effective and come in varied resistance so people can use lighter or stronger bands if they feel the exercises [are] too easy or too hard.\"\nDeRosa recommended this five-pack of bands to start off with.\n\u201cRoutines with the bands can be used to build upper body strength and lower body strength and of course should never be painful when performing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe always like to incorporate functional exercises, like sit to stand from a chair or bed and supported step ups as these are weight-bearing exercises that not only build strength but also help increase bone density [since] our bone density decreases as we age.\u201d\nA pair of ankle weights\n\"Adjustable ankle weights are great for doing upper and lower body exercises and allow you to increase or decrease resistance as needed,\" DeRosa explained.\nDeRosa recommended this pair of ankle weights, which are each adjustable from one to five pounds. They also have adjustable straps to ensure a comfortable fit. They're available in multiple colors and with higher weight offerings.\nAn under-desk elliptical machine\n\"[The] Cubii elliptical machine is a great way to increase lower body strength, ROM [an exercise technique to improve joint flexibility and mobility] and build some cardiovascular endurance,\" DeRosa wrote.\nThe Cubii elliptical, which DeRosa specifically recommended, is compact, portable and offers adjustable peddling resistance. It fits easily under couches, arm chairs and desk chairs so you can enjoy a low-impact workout while sitting at home. It also has Bluetooth connectivity and an app that tracks your strides, time and more.\nShort balance activities, like the ones in this training book\n\u201cFalls are one of the most common way seniors injure themselves. Incorporating safe balance training to a program is essential,\u201d said DeRosa. He recommended this book to get started, and also noted that many older folks enjoy chair yoga to improve balance and overall strength.", "The benefits of 'body doubling' when you have ADHD, according to experts. Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up for CNN\u2019s Adulthood, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide has tips to help you make more informed decisions around personal finance, career, wellness and personal connections.\nOnce a week, ADHD coach Robin Nordmeyer joins a Zoom meeting with other coaches while she writes blogs, does administrative tasks or works on content for presentations she has been putting off.\nNordmeyer, who has ADHD, isn\u2019t necessarily using the meeting to collaborate with others \u2014 she just needs their presence as a motivator to help her get things done.\n\u201cI run a business, and I have to balance lots of different areas of the business,\u201d said Nordmeyer, cofounder and managing director of the Center for Living Well with ADHD-Minnesota, an ADHD coaching group near Minneapolis serving all ages.\n\u201cSome of those things come very easy \u2014 like, they\u2019re in my wheelhouse, they energize me, I can\u2019t wait to get to them,\u201d Nordmeyer said. \u201cAnd some of those things are a little more tedious, or I have some resistance around them.\u201d\nWhat Nordmeyer does to get through those tougher tasks is sometimes known as \u201cbody doubling,\u201d a productivity and self-help strategy that involves working with another person around to help improve motivation and focus. It has been popular for some time among people with ADHD \u2014 attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder \u2014 especially during the pandemic.\n\u201cThe idea is that the presence of another is essentially a gentle reminder to stay on task,\u201d said Billy Roberts, clinical director of Focused Mind ADHD Counseling in Columbus, Ohio. \u201cFor folks (with) ADHD whose minds tend to wander and get off task, the body double somehow works as an external motivator to stay on task.\u201d\nBody doubling isn\u2019t just for people with ADHD, but like many \u201ccoping strategies, something that can be helpful for anybody is more central and important for folks with ADHD,\u201d said Dr. J. Russell Ramsay, founding codirector of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s ADHD Treatment and Research Program.\nWhy body doubling works\nA neurodevelopmental disorder commonly diagnosed in childhood but lasting into adulthood, ADHD stems from underdeveloped or impaired executive function and self-regulation skills, according to Harvard University\u2019s Center on the Developing Child. Those skills help us to plan, focus attention, remember instructions and multitask. Symptoms of ADHD include inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity \u2014 so people with this disorder might have trouble concentrating, staying organized, managing their time or controlling their impulses, which can affect both their work and personal lives, Roberts said.\nIf people with ADHD have no intrinsic interest in a task, Roberts said, they typically struggle with a lack of internal motivation to complete it or even to get started. Body doubling provides that motivation, experts said.\n\u201cIt also draws on our social selves,\u201d Ramsay said. \u201cA lot of people with ADHD will say, \u2018I have a hard time getting started on this if I\u2019m doing it for myself, but if I know somebody else is relying on me, if somebody else is waiting outside for me to show up to go for our walk, I\u2019m more likely to go and be there because I don\u2019t want to let them down.\u2019\u201d\nThere doesn\u2019t appear to be extensive research on body doubling for productivity, according to Roberts and other experts. \u201cBut I do know that the idea of externalizing motivation is a long-standing, evidence-based mechanism for managing ADHD,\u201d Roberts said.\nIn theory, the method is pretty straightforward, but there a few factors to keep in mind to make the most of it.\nHow to use body doubling effectively\nBody doubling can help with pretty much any task you\u2019re having a hard time getting done \u2014 whether that\u2019s work, chores, exercise, schoolwork or paperwork. The other person doesn\u2019t have to be doing the same thing as you, unless the activity you need body doubling for \u2014 such as exercising \u2014 requires that assistance.\nBe choosy about whom you ask to be your body double. The person should be as committed to you completing your work as you are, Roberts said \u2014 not distracting you with conversation or anything else. Choose someone who usually makes you feel comfortable and safe, and who can encourage you when necessary.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to keep a body double session focused on its purpose,\u201d Nordmeyer said. If conversations do come up, table them for later, perhaps during a break or dinner.\nAsking someone to be your body double might feel awkward, but Roberts said the best approach is often a straightforward one. You could say, \u201cIt\u2019s something I heard can help with productivity. Would you mind just being around me while I work on this? Maybe you have something you could work on, too.\u201d\nYou could also barter with them, in a sense, by making an offer such as, \u201cYou help me organize my garage on Saturday; I\u2019ll help you organize your home office on Sunday,\u201d Ramsay said.\nThose small first steps of seeking a partner and setting up the session get you started and keep you going, he added.\nScheduling regular body doubling sessions is one option, Nordmeyer said, or just ask whenever the need arises. How transparent you are about why you need a body double is up to you, as is whether you have more than one body double.\n\u201cIt depends on the individual,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cIf it turns into a distraction more than mindfulness, accountability or behavioral support, then you just want to rework things. You can kind of tinker with things until you find what works.\u201d\nVirtual body doubling\nIf you don\u2019t have a friend or colleague to be your body double, you aren\u2019t out of luck.\nSome TikTok users, such as Allie K. Campbell, regularly go live while they\u2019re working so others can use them as a virtual body double. There are also body doubling or coworking platforms or apps such as Flown, Focusmate or Flow Club.\nIn virtual sessions, \u201cmost body doubles ask you to share your camera, and a lot of people are real nervous about being visible,\u201d Nordmeyer said. \u201cThe purpose of that is to make sure you\u2019re still in your chair working. \u2026 But there might be other ways you can create that accountability through a chat feature.\u201d\nThe benefits of body doubling are likely why some people like working on things in coffee shops, libraries or coworking spaces \u2014 which can be sources of passive body doubling if you don\u2019t have someone to ask, Roberts said.\n\u201cSome people work better with community support and just the awareness of other people around them,\u201d he added. \u201cYou saw that a lot with the pandemic, like people learning more about the kinds of structure they needed.\n\u201cWe all think and work differently, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that,\u201d Roberts said.", "Couples who cuddle before sleep reap key health benefits, study reveals.

The goal, supporters said, is to stop those big companies from using their buying power to squeeze out local independent pharmacies and give consumers fewer choices.\nBut CVS, which owns both a pharmacy benefits manager and a chain of drugstores, said the bill would force them to close 119 Louisiana pharmacies, affecting 1 million patients across the state and 22,000 patients who receive high-cost specialty drugs that smaller pharmacies could find difficult to handle.\nIt would also put 2,700 CVS employees out of work, the drug retailer said.\nThe company launched a massive lobbying campaign, including text messages to CVS customers urging them to reach out to their lawmakers.\n\u201cLast minute legislation in Louisiana threatens to close your CVS Pharmacy \u2014 your medication cost may go up and your pharmacist may lose their job,\u201d one such text said.\nThe ad blitz infuriated some lawmakers, who said they were standing up to massive companies that have choked independent, local pharmacies and squeezed consumers over drug prices.

PBM supporters say they can help keep drug costs down, but critics argue they pocket too much of the savings.\nPreviously, public legislative debate centered around House Bill 264, which would bar pharmacy benefit managers from steering customers to their own pharmacies. It would also require that discounts they negotiate go to employers and consumers.\nHB264 also requires pharmacy benefit managers to report more details of their activities to government regulators to ensure that they are following the law.\nOn Wednesday, though, a different bill became the center of attention: House Bill 358. That bill was originally designed to set new rules for when pharmacy technicians can work remotely, and had passed both the House and the Senate.\nBut the bill emerged from a conference committee \u2014 a process in which a group of lawmakers from both the House and the Senate works behind closed doors to negotiate between the two chambers \u2014 with the new language addressing PBMs.\n\u201cNo permit to operate a pharmacy shall be granted or renewed to a pharmacy that is wholly or partially owned or controlled by a pharmacy benefit manager or its subsidiary,\u201d that language said.\nCVS and a handful of legislators criticized that process, arguing a major change to policy that could affect thousands of people was being added at the last minute with little public debate.\n\u201cA backroom deal isn\u2019t the best way to proceed,\u201d said Accetta.\nIf the change is something that lawmakers are seriously considering, they should do appropriate research, hold public hearings and understand the economic impact to the state, she said.\nBut Rep. Dustin Miller, an Opelousas Democrat who is sponsoring HB358, said the issue has been debated for years in various parts of the legislature. He also said the bill wouldn\u2019t take effect for a full year, giving CVS time to make the changes it needs to keep the pharmacies open.\n\u201cWe have set the effective date of this bill January 2027,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will be here and have a whole other session if there is anything that we have to address.\u201d\nArkansas previously passed a similar bill, and CVS has filed a lawsuit trying to stop it.\nAsked if legal action could be on the table should the measure become law, CVS spokesperson Amy Thibault said, \u201cWe will do anything and everything that we can to keep our pharmacy operations up and running in Louisiana.\u201d\nConcerns about specialty drugs\nAccetta said the legislation would force CVS to stop sending specialty drugs to patients in Louisiana for chronic or complex conditions like cancer, hemophilia and multiple sclerosis.\n\u201cWe\u2019re specially trained in these therapies typically not seen in independent pharmacies,\u201d she said. \u201cIn some cases we are the only distributor of those drugs across this country.\u201d\nMiller said there are plenty of pharmacies in the state that can handle specialty drugs, but PBMs often decline to fill prescriptions at those pharmacies because they\u2019re trying to steer patients to the pharmacies they own.\n\u201cThere are pharmacies available to do all of the specialty items that they\u2019re talking about. They\u2019ve just never been given the opportunity,\u201d he said.\nRep. Mandie Landry, D-New Orleans, one of the few votes against HB358, said she wanted to vote for the bill but could not due to desperate texts from her constituents.\n\u201cI\u2019ve gotten messages like: \u2018Is there any way this can be stopped? I\u2019m literally sobbing because my husband will die without this specialty medicine,\u2019\u201d said Landry.\nBut Beryl Amed\u00e9e, R-Gray, who supported the bill, complained that PBMs made it unnecessarily difficult for her sister, who battled brain cancer and died after 10 months, to get her chemotherapy drugs.\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you the hours and days that she should have been sitting with her grandchildren, but she was instead having to come and fight with pharmaceutical companies, with PBMs,\u201d Amed\u00e9e said.\nAmed\u00e9e said the PBMs made her sister follow seemingly arbitrary rules and it often felt that her health was not their main consideration.\n\u201cI think I know what their consideration was. It\u2019s called the bottom line,\u201d she added.", "Louisiana Senate kills pharmacy bill; Gov. Jeff Landry could call special session. With just an hour left in the regular session, the Louisiana Senate on Thursday killed a controversial bill that would have barred companies from owning both pharmacy benefits managers and pharmacies.\nThat decision defied Gov. Jeff Landry, who said he would call the legislature back in for a special session to address the PBM issue.\n\u201cYes we will have a special to lower prescription drugs for our citizens. It's that important!\" Landry said in a statement through a spokesperson.\nIt was not clear when Landry might issue that call.\nSenate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, said senators had concerns about the rapid pace at which House Bill 358 was being considered \u2014 it only emerged from a conference committee with the language addressing PBMs Wednesday afternoon.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a legislative process for a reason,\u201d Henry said. \u201cThat amendment did not have one ounce of public testimony through the process.\u201d\nHenry pointed out that the bill would not have taken effect until 2027 anyway, had it passed, which meant the Legislature could simply vote on the bill next year.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why you would call a special session for a bill that doesn\u2019t take effect until 2027,\u201d Henry said.\nWhat the bills do\nRather than approve the governor\u2019s preferred policy change, the Senate passed a last-minute resolution asking for a study on the impact of prohibiting PBM ownership of pharmacies, a practice known as \u201cvertical integration.\u201d\nAnd the Legislature passed a bill that would set new rules for how those companies can operate, requiring them to pass more of their savings on prescription drugs to consumers and barring them from requiring customers to use their drug stores.\nThe series of political maneuvers and votes came after a ferocious, last-minute lobbying battle between some of the country\u2019s largest PBMs \u2014including CVS, which sent a barrage of text messages to customers urging opposition to the bill \u2014 and Landry, who publicly pressured legislators to restrict the PBM giants.\nHB358 would have banned companies from owning both pharmacy benefit managers and pharmacies. Supporters argue doing so would stop big companies from pushing out independent pharmacies.\nPBMs act as middlemen between pharmacies, health care plans and drug manufacturers to negotiate lower drug costs, but critics say they have too much power over the drug market, drive out competition and limit where people can get their prescriptions filled.\nCVS, which owns both a PBM and a nationwide chain of drug stores, said the bill would have forced it to close its 119 stores in Louisiana, affecting about 1 million patients across the state and 22,000 patients who receive high-cost specialty drugs that smaller pharmacies could find difficult to handle.\n\u201cOur focus remains on serving the people of Louisiana: lowering drug costs, providing access to care, and helping improve health,\u201d said CVS spokesperson Amy Thibault after the Legislature adjourned. \u201cWe look forward to working productively with policymakers to continue to make prescription drugs more affordable and accessible and promoting the value of community pharmacy.\u201d\nIn the hours before the session\u2019s 6 p.m. deadline, Landry and other PBM critics took to social media to pressure legislators.\nLandry, who for days had been publicly urging the Legislature to pass the PBM-pharmacy prohibition, said in a post on X hours before the end of the session that he could quickly call lawmakers back into a special session should they reject the measure.\nDonald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s son, weighed in on the PBM political battle 20 minutes later with a post on X: \u201cLouisiana, it\u2019s time to pass HB358 and end the charade that costs hard-working Americans so much money when buying prescription drugs.\u201d\nThe House on Wednesday approved the bill on an 88-4 vote. But the Senate did not bring it up for a vote Thursday.\nInstead, its members passed without opposition a resolution, SR 209 sponsored by Sen. Kirk Talbot, R-River Ridge, asking the Louisiana Department of Health to study the idea of implementing the rules sought in HB358.\nThe House ultimately unanimously approved House Bill 264 by Rep. Michael Echols, R-Monroe, which establishes new rules for PBMs. In addition to requiring more money go to customers, the bill requires PBMs to disclose more information to the state.\nOn the House floor, Echols said HB264 includes \u201cstronger oversight tools,\u201d protects consumers, enhances transparency and addresses \u201cheinous practices\u201d by PBMs.\n\"Today is a giant leap forward, and we keep our promise to you to fix these problems.\" Echols said. \"We're not done. I think we're just beginning, but this opens a big door for us to go through.\"\nTalbot said HB264 was a sign that \u201cthe big pharmacies are on notice now.\u201d And he said the Senate may be open in the future to banning vertical integration.\n\u201cIt ain\u2019t over,\u201d Talbot said.\nText messages draw ire of state leaders\nCVS\u2019s decision to send text message blasts urging customers to oppose HB358 infuriated state leaders.\nLouisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill announced Thursday she would issue a cease-and-desist demand letter over the texts.\nShe also announced an investigation into CVS over the text messages, saying that using patient contact information for lobbying may not be \u201can appropriate use of personal information obtained through a state contract.\u201d\nCaremark, which is part of the CVS family of companies, is a PBM for the state government.\nGov. Jeff Landry slammed CVS on social media saying, \u201cAbusing patients\u2019 sensitive information to push a political message is completely unethical and manipulative and we will not stand for it.\u201d\nThibault, the CVS spokesperson, said in a statement the company's communications with its customers, patients and community members were \"consistent with the law.\"\n\"We believe we have a responsibility to inform our customers of misguided legislation that seeks to shutter their trusted pharmacy, and we acted accordingly,\" she said.\nEchols said the legislature could not be bullied, because it always sides with Louisianans.\nControversy as the clock ran out\nDebate over HB 358 exploded in the last two days of the session.\nThe bill was originally designed to allow pharmacy technicians to access pharmacy records and systems remotely. But on Wednesday afternoon, it emerged from a conference committee \u2014 where lawmakers from each chamber meet behind closed doors to work through disagreements \u2014 to add the provision about pharmacy and PBM ownership.\nCVS hads blasted that process, saying the state was making a major change to pharmacy laws at the last minute with no public hearings.\nSupporters argued the restriction on PBMs would stop big corporations from having an unfair advantage that has led to the closure of independent pharmacies.\nIndependent pharmacies have been getting reimbursed less and less every year \u201cbecause the PBMs want to make their own pockets fatter,\u201d Rep. Dustin Miller, D-Opelousas, who is sponsoring HB 358, said on the House floor Wednesday.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s time that we tell PBMs you have to choose: You\u2019re either a PBM or you\u2019re a pharmacy in Louisiana,\u201d Miller said.\nLawmakers in favor the change said they weren\u2019t forcing any pharmacies to close.\nBut Thibault said, \u201cIt\u2019s not possible to operate a PBM in all states but one.\u201d\n\u201cPBMs serve employers with people in multiple states. You can\u2019t have a state-by-state PBM, so we don\u2019t have a choice,\u201d she said.\nArkansas passed a similar earlier this year. CVS has filed a lawsuit seeking to block it from taking effect.\nPatients react to CVS campaign\nOn Thursday, a steady trickle of customers picked up prescriptions as usual at stores on Magazine Street and Prytania Street.\nAfter a morning of doctors\u2019 appointments, Cynthia Marshall, 72, stopped to pick up a prescription after seeing a text message from CVS. She hadn\u2019t had a chance to learn more about the bill, but said there were alternatives if the store did close.\n\u201cWe would probably just go to Walgreens,\u201d said Marshall.\nBut Marshall said Walgreens is small, and she was concerned about it taking on the patient load of closed stores.\nAlong with the text campaign, CVS stores across Louisiana hung colorful \u201cSave our Store\u201d posters at their entrances, and some locations even passed out flyers to customers.\nJordan Hefler, of Baton Rouge, stopped at a CVS store Wednesday and said the cashier handed her a \u201cSave our Store\u201d flyer containing a QR code. The employee urged her to sign a petition.\nHefler was initially confused and worried about CVS stores closing. But she said she looked into the issue and realized it was more \u201ccomplicated\u201d and \u201cprobably not as immediate as it was made to sound.\u201d\nSome CVS patrons said they had not heard of the news, and weren\u2019t too worried about it.\nAllen Hall, of Watson, uses the pharmacy at the Denham Springs CVS and said Thursday he had not received any texts from CVS or heard about possible closures.\n\u201cIf they shut down, I\u2019ll just go somewhere else,\u201d Hall said.", "Pharmacy benefits managers are at the center of Louisiana's drug debate. What are they?. With less than 24 hours left in the legislative session, Louisiana lawmakers are locked in a fierce battle over a proposal that would change the way pharmacies are allowed to operate in the state.\nLast-minute changes made to House Bill 358 have prompted a massive public lobbying campaign from drugstore chain CVS, with a text message sent to customers Wednesday afternoon that said the legislation \"threatens to close your CVS pharmacy.\"\nThe legislation, designed to favor independent pharmacies, would ban pharmacy benefits managers from owning or partially owning pharmacies in Louisiana, a move that supporters say represents a strong pushback against corporations squeezing consumers.\nIf passed, the bill would force the closure of over 100 CVS pharmacies in Louisiana, company officials say.\nIf HB 358 is signed into law, it would not go into effect until 2026.\nHere's what to know.\nWhat is a pharmacy benefits manager?\nPharmacy benefits managers are companies that negotiate lower drug prices by acting as middlemen between drug manufacturers, insurance companies and pharmacies.\nTheir roles have expanded over the decades and PBMs are now at the center of drug distribution. Supporters say they can help keep costs down, but critics argue benefit managers pocket too much of the savings.\nPBMs purchase drugs from drug wholesalers. They are also responsible for deciding which drugs are and aren't covered by your insurance, and how much you have to pay for prescription drugs.\nAccording to a 2024 report from the Federal Trade Commission, the top three PBMs in the country include CVS Caremark, Express Scripts, and OptumRx. Together, the FTC says they manage 79% of of prescriptions filled in the U.S. for about 270 million people. The FTC launched a broad investigation into pharmacy benefit managers in 2022.\nOther state legislatures have moved to restrict PBMs in recent years, including Arkansas, California, Maine and New York. Congress also aimed to pass legislation last year to regulate PBMs.\nPharmacy operations in Louisiana\nHow could the bill affect where Louisianans can get their prescriptions filled? The full scope of the legislation is still coming into view.\nCVS retail pharmacies are owned by PBM CVS-Caremark, and officials say the bill's passage would close hundreds of their neighborhood pharmacies. CVS-Caremark also owns a mail service pharmacy, though it's unclear if those operations would be affected by the bill.\nLocal, independent pharmacies would not be directly affected by the bill. According to the Louisiana Independent Pharmacies Association, there are roughly 400 independent community pharmacies in the state. You can find your closest independent pharmacy on their website.\nWhat's next?\nHB 358 has already received approval from House members.\nNow, on the last day of the session, it must go before state Senate for final approval. The Senate is set to gavel in at 9 a.m. Thursday.\nThen, lawmakers in the chamber could choose to vote to approve the bill as is, make amendments or outright reject the bill.\nIf a majority of senators do decide to approval the bill in its current form, it is likely to receive Gov. Jeff Landry's signature, the last step a bill needs before becoming a law.\nLandry has already given public support for the bill, praising it on X Wednesday."]}, {"topic": 68, "name": "CDC and HHS Layoffs", "keywords": "employees, cdc, health, hhs, workers, notices, prevention, hepatitis, laboratories, the", "documents": ["CDC workers fired from prominent STI, hepatitis labs are rehired.

Kennedy Jr.\u2019s goal of slimming down a workforce he has repeatedly said is rife with waste, fraud and abuse.\nA federal judge Friday temporarily blocked the Trump administration\u2019s sweeping layoffs at several agencies, including HHS, saying that cooperation of the legislative branch is required for large-scale reorganizations.\nKennedy eliminated thousands of jobs in early April, paralyzing programs across the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and particularly in the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, that monitored health threats, researched cures and investigated everything from toxic fumes in fire stations to outbreaks of gonorrhea.\nThe layoffs at NIOSH have halted the National Firefighter Cancer Registry, Fire Fighter Fatality Investigation and Prevention Program, Health Hazard Evaluation Program, Respirator Approval Program and Coal Workers\u2019 Health Surveillance Program. All are required by law, but their government websites explain they are no longer operating because of the layoffs.\n\u201cIf the law requires you, the executive, to do this work, you have, in a back door way, thumbed your nose at Congress by firing the people who are actually necessary to get that work done,\u201d said Max Stier, the president and CEO of the nonpartisan, nonprofit Partnership for Public Service, whose mission is supporting the federal workforce. \u201cThe executive branch is supposed to execute \u2014 the name says it all.

Some employees were brought back in early May but told their jobs would be gone again in the coming months.\nThe budget request the White House sent Congress on May 2 proposed slashing more than a quarter of HHS\u2019 budget, a reduction of tens of billions of dollars, while allocating $500 million to the new \u201cAHA\u201d office that Kennedy said will take over many of the programs impacted by cuts. The budget also urges Congress to get rid of \u201cduplicative, DEI, or simply unnecessary programs,\u201d including the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control \u2014 which the DOGE memo said the department is legally required to maintain.\nSome congressionally mandated programs saw their entire staff dismissed, including the firefighter cancer registry that was created by legislation President Donald Trump signed in his first term. Micah Niemeier-Walsh, vice president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 3840, said she and every other member of the National Firefighter Registry for Cancer team received notices that their jobs would be eliminated this summer.\nThe cancer registry, along with NIOSH\u2019s Fire Fighter Fatality Investigation and Prevention Program, Health Hazard Evaluation Program, Respirator Approval Program and Coal Workers\u2019 Health Surveillance Program, all state on their government websites that they are no longer operating because of the layoffs.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how they\u2019re planning on actually doing \u2026 a meaningful scientific study, like it\u2019s supposed to be, if there aren\u2019t any scientists to work on that study,\u201d Niemeier-Walsh said.\nOther programs lost most but not all of their staff, but federal workers said those layoffs have left those who remain unable to do their work.\nAn official in NIOSH\u2019s National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory, granted anonymity out of fear of retaliation, said all but seven of the more than 75 workers in that office were given layoff notices, rendering it \u201cno longer functioning.\u201d A notice on the lab\u2019s website reads: \u201cDue to the reduction in force across NIOSH, no new respirator approval applications can be accepted.\u201d\nThe official warned that the cuts have not only wiped out their ability to test and certify new types of respirators \u2014 as required by Congress since 2001 \u2014 but also to inspect the thousands of breathing masks the lab already approved. The official predicted this will lead to an influx of shoddy or counterfeit respirators and the loss of the public\u2019s trust in NIOSH\u2019s certification.\nBeyond the laws requiring these programs exist, there are federal laws that require workers wear NIOSH-approved protective gear, including health care workers who use filtering facepiece respirators and firefighters who use self-contained breathing apparatuses.\nStier, an attorney, believes these Trump administration cuts go \u201cbeyond their legal institutional authority.\u201d But stopping the layoffs and preventing new ones \u201creally requires the courts to do their jobs, and Congress, to stand up to an executive invading their prerogatives,\u201d he said.\nThe American Federation of Government Employees sued the Trump administration over the cuts, along with other unions representing federal workers and local government officials. They argued last week that \u201conly Congress has the power to change the federal government in the ways the President has directed.\u201d\nSenior U.S. District Judge Susan Illston in San Francisco agreed, noting in her Friday ruling, which blocked Trump\u2019s executive order, that while the president may reorganize the executive branch, \u201che must do so in lawful ways and, in the case of large-scale reorganizations, with the cooperation of the legislative branch.\u201d\nThe Department of Justice appealed the ruling, and the next hearing is scheduled for May 22.\nNearly two dozen Democratic state attorneys general have also sued over the \u201cevisceration of the Department\u2019s statutorily mandated work promoting public health\u201d in a Rhode Island federal court. Their complaint points in particular to cuts that have shuttered the CDC\u2019s Atlanta-based lab that analyzes samples of sexually transmitted infections from around the country, citing a notice the agency posted April 11 listing nearly 100 kinds of tests that are \u201cno longer performed at CDC\u201d \u2014 including those for gonorrhea, chlamydia and syphilis.\nSome lawmakers, including those who drafted the legislation that created and funded the now-gutted programs, are also pushing back.\nSen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) sponsored the 1992 bill that created the CDC\u2019s Assisted Reproductive Technology Surveillance System when he served in the House. Every employee working on the program, which tracks the safety and success rates of every fertility clinic in the country, was put on administrative leave in April and told they would lose their jobs this summer.\n\u201cCongress has the power of the purse,\u201d Wyden said. \u201cThis law has been on the books \u2014 I\u2019ve watched it carefully over the years. \u2026 It is stunning that somebody would call himself essentially Mr. Fertilization and then walk back [this] program,\u201d he added, referencing Trump\u2019s campaign statements in support of IVF.\nWyden joined with a dozen Democratic colleagues on a letter to Kennedy on Thursday demanding answers by May 16 to several question about cuts to the CDC team, including the justification for each worker\u2019s termination, whether and when they will be reinstated, whether Elon Musk was involved in the decision to cut the team, and what will happen to the data IVF clinics continue to submit to the now-shuttered office.\nSome Senate Republicans, including Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, are also telling administration officials and the public that they oppose the cuts, casting them as harmful to their constituents and a violation of Congress\u2019 power. But other lawmakers, while expressing fear about the impact of the layoffs on workers in their states, said they trust the president to make things right without Congress\u2019 involvement.\nWest Virginia Republican Sen. Jim Justice told POLITICO that he\u2019s \u201cconcerned\u201d but not \u201csuper nervous\u201d about the layoffs in NIOSH\u2019s Morgantown office that have hampered the congressionally mandated program which has screened coal miners for black lung disease for more than 50 years.\n\u201cThere is just plain no way that Donald Trump is going to do something to endanger the health of our coal miners \u2014 especially at the same time that we\u2019re asking more of them,\u201d he said, citing Trump\u2019s call to increase domestic coal production. \u201cEven if the jobs left us, which we don\u2019t want to believe, I do believe they\u2019re going to be merged into another organization. It may look a little different, but it will serve the purpose.\u201d"]}, {"topic": 69, "name": "Gaza Aid Blockade and Activist Intervention", "keywords": "gaza, thunberg, greta, aid, madleen, israel, activists, flotilla, israeli, ship", "documents": ["Greta Thunberg: Silence and Inaction Is More Deadly Than Me Sailing to Gaza.

Copy may not be in its final form.\nAMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I\u2019m Amy Goodman, with Juan Gonz\u00e1lez.\nAs Gaza faces more than three months of a near-total Israeli blockade, activists are heading there now on a ship to deliver humanitarian aid. The boat is called the Madleen, named after Gaza\u2019s first fisherwoman, who ran her father\u2019s fishing business after he was injured in a 2009 Israeli attack. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition initially planned to sail from Malta last month, but their ship was damaged after it was bombed by drones in international waters. At Sunday\u2019s launch of the Madleen from the Italian port of Catania, actor Liam Cunningham, known for his role in the series Game of Thrones, spoke out in support of the effort.\nLIAM CUNNINGHAM: My name is Liam. I\u2019m from Ireland. The reason I\u2019m here, as far as I\u2019m concerned, the heart and soul of humanity is in Gaza. For me, this attack, this genocide, is not just on Palestinians. It is on the whole human race. These wonderful, brave people who are setting off on this boat, they are heroes. And also, the people of Gaza for the last 600 days are heroes. They are \u2014 in my mind, they will always be heroes.\nAMY GOODMAN: A group of 12 activists are carrying the aid for Gaza, including the Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who will join us from the Madleen ship in a minute. She spoke Sunday at the launch.\nGRETA THUNBERG: A month after our latest attempt to go on with this mission, the boat was bombed twice. All evidence suggests Israel. And we are doing this because we have to keep our promise to the Palestinians to do everything in our power to protest against the genocide and to try to open up a humanitarian corridor.\nAMY GOODMAN: Since setting sail, passengers on the flotilla have faced many threats, including from U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, who wrote on X, quote, \u201cHope Greta and her friends can swim!\u201d unquote. The Gaza Freedom Flotilla has also been shadowed by at least one military helicopter and have reported drones circulating the ship. This is Thiago \u00c1vila.\nTHIAGO \u00c1VILA: Hello, everyone. This is a new alert. We can clearly see a drone right now to our left. It\u2019s gaining on us a little bit. We share this alert, second alert of the night, the third day of our journey to Gaza to break the siege and create a people\u2019s humanitarian corridor aboard the Madleen. Please share our location. We\u2019ll be sending the exact coordinates.\nAMY GOODMAN: In 2010, Israel conducted a deadly raid on another Gaza-bound aid ship, the Mavi Marmara. Israeli commandos stormed the boat in international waters, killing nine people. A 10th died after four years in a coma.\nFor more, we\u2019re joined from the international waters by Greta Thunberg, the internationally renowned Swedish climate activist known for inspiring the global youth climate strike. In 2019, she received the Right Livelihood Award. She\u2019s also been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Greta is speaking to us aboard the Gaza Freedom Flotilla\u2019s vessel Madleen, which is on this voyage from Sicily to Gaza, again, carrying lifesaving aid in an attempt to break Israel\u2019s siege of the Gaza Strip.\nGreta, it\u2019s really something to see you on that ship right now. Can you tell us why you\u2019re taking this journey, extremely dangerous, and how you\u2019re planning to challenge the Israeli blockade?\nGRETA THUNBERG: Yeah. Thank you so much for having me.\nYeah, as you said, we are doing this mission following one month after our last attempt. Boat Conscience was bombed and disabled. So, that\u2019s why we are trying again, because we cannot afford to give up. There is simply too much at stake. And in times of injustice, as we are seeing now the genocide and blockade happening, we have to do everything we can to demand an end to these atrocities and war crimes committed by Israel.\nAnd for me personally, I happen to have a platform for some reason, and then it is my moral obligation to use that platform. And if my presence on this boat can make a difference, if that can show in any way that the world has not forgotten about Palestine, and to try once again to attempt to break the siege and open up a humanitarian corridor and deliver the extremely needed humanitarian aid, then that is a risk I am willing to take.\nAnd it\u2019s something that we just simply have to do. We cannot just sit, sit around and do nothing and watch this like live-streamed genocide unfold in front of our very eyes. So we are doing this because we are human beings who care about justice. And when our complicit governments fail to step up, it falls on us, unfortunately, to do so.\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: And, Greta, could you talk about how you see the issue of Palestinian freedom connecting to or intersecting with the issue that you\u2019re best known for, which is climate change activism?\nGRETA THUNBERG: Yeah. For me, there is no way of distinguishing the two. We cannot have climate justice without social justice. The reason why I am a climate activist is not because I want to protect trees. I\u2019m a climate activist because I care about human and planetary well-being, and those are extremely interlinked. For example, when we see the genocide in Gaza, of course, there are some very obvious links, that ecocide, environmental destruction is a very common method used in war and to oppress people.\nBut also, it should be much simpler than that. No matter what the cause of the suffering is, whether that is CO2, whether that is bombs, whether that is state repression or other forms of violence, we have to stand up against that source of suffering. And if we pretend to care about the environment, if we pretend to care about the climate and our children\u2019s future, without seeing and acknowledging and fighting against the suffering of all marginalized people today, then that is an extremely racist approach to justice that excludes the majority of the world\u2019s population.\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: And what is the mood aboard the ship? You have participants from Brazil, France, Germany, Spain, and you yourself are Swedish. What\u2019s the mood there?\nGRETA THUNBERG: The mood on board the ship is \u2014 I would say that our spirits are very high, and we are very determined to continue. So far, we have won over one of the major predicted obstacles, which is to be stuck in port due to the bureaucratic warfare that has been very strong, especially in the past. And the fact that we have gotten over that and that we are out sailing now and that we have gotten quite a far bit is already a victory in itself.\nAnd, of course, this mission is \u2014 includes many risks, and we have done many risk assessments. But, of course, we deem the risk of silence and the risk of inaction to be so much more deadly than this mission, of course. And we are 12 peaceful volunteers who are not carrying weapons. We are carrying food, medical supplies and sanitary products and other very needed humanitarian aid into Gaza following the blockade. And we will meet whatever is thrown at us with nonviolence in any scenario. So, we are trying to prepare and to maximize our safety and the success of this mission as much as we can.\nAMY GOODMAN: Greta, as you attempt to bring in baby formula, medical kits, flour, prosthetics for kids with amputations, the Israeli military has threatened to block the Freedom Flotilla. The Israeli army says it\u2019s prepared to raid your ship. We know what happened to the Mavi Marmara with the Israeli raid and the killing of nine activists on board. Ultimately, a 10th died. So, are you seeing drones? How are you prepared to deal?\nGRETA THUNBERG: Yeah, yeah, we are seeing drones. Last night, there were two different moments where there were drones circulating above us. And we are \u2014 we have safety procedures that we will use, and we have different scenarios that we are prepared for to try to maximize our safety in a nonviolent way. So, we are trying to do our very best. And it shows quite a bit that peaceful volunteers who are carrying humanitarian aid necessary for survival is being threatened to be raided, intercepted or attacked. I think that says quite a lot about the priorities and approaches of Israel right now.\nBut we must also remember that this mission is not about us. It is not about the voyage or the people on board. This mission is about Palestine. It is about the genocide, the occupation, ethnic cleansing and the other methods of war and oppression that are being used by Israel against the Palestinians. And we do not only need humanitarian aid to be let into Gaza. We do not only need a ceasefire. We need an end to the occupation.\nAMY GOODMAN: How do you plan to break the military blockade around Gaza?\nGRETA THUNBERG: Sorry. What did you say?\nAMY GOODMAN: How do you plan to break the military blockade around Gaza?\nGRETA THUNBERG: We are planning to continue sailing until we cannot sail anymore. It is very difficult to predict what scenario it will be, but as far as we know, we are planning to continue, to continue as we are now.\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: And what is your message to folks around the world, especially to young people who, throughout \u2014\nGRETA THUNBERG: Yeah.\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ: \u2014 the advanced countries, seem to have much more interest and dedication to ending the war in Gaza?\nGRETA THUNBERG: My message is that right now international law is failing us. International institutions, our governments are failing us. Media, our companies are all failing us. Or \u201cfailing us\u201d is a diplomatic way of saying that our system seems to be designed in a way that is built upon exploitation and oppression of people. And so, there\u2019s no one to turn to. There\u2019s no one we can turn to to rescue the situation, but it falls on us to step up, to continue flooding the streets, to continue organizing, boycotting, to speak up on all platforms to try to send a clear message that we will not stand for what is happening right now.\nAMY GOODMAN: According to Al Jazeera, Greta, they\u2019re saying, according to flight radar, which tracks aircraft movements, an Israel-made Hellenic Coast Guard drone, IAI Heron UAV, hovered over the Madleen ship. The drone\u2019s deployment was confirmed by the Greek Ministry of Defense. We\u2019re speaking to you from the United States, where the \u2014\nGRETA THUNBERG: Yeah.\nAMY GOODMAN: \u2014 South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham wrote on X, \u201cHope Greta and her friends can swim!\u201d Your response?\nGRETA THUNBERG: We can swim very well. It says a lot about their priorities, that in the face of genocide and systematic starvation of 2 million people, lawmakers, elected officials, whose responsibility should be to serve the people and to protect the people, that they, rather than ending their complicity in genocide and the massive slaughtering of civilians, are focusing on mocking people who are at least trying to do their bit. I think that says everything we need to know about their priorities.\nAMY GOODMAN: And finally, your message to Palestinians who perhaps have read about or heard about your voyage, are awaiting your arrival? What is your message to them?\nGRETA THUNBERG: My message to them would be that we stand behind you in every step of the way. We are standing in solidarity with you. We see you. And I am also \u2014 my deepest apologies on behalf of the outside world, especially the Western world, that we continue to betray you and that more people are not stepping up. But I promise that at least we here will try our very best to stand up for you \u2014\nAMY GOODMAN: Well, Greta \u2014\nGRETA THUNBERG: \u2014 as well, and to support you in your struggle.\nAMY GOODMAN: Greta, we wish you all safety. Greta Thunberg, internationally \u2014\nGRETA THUNBERG: Thank you.\nAMY GOODMAN: \u2014 renowned Swedish climate activist who inspired the global youth climate strike.

The boat, accompanied by Israel\u2019s navy, arrived in Ashdod in the evening, according to Israel\u2019s Foreign Ministry. It published a photo on social media of Thunberg after disembarking. The 12 activists were undergoing medical checks to ensure they are in good health, the ministry said. They were expected to be held at a detention facility in Ramle before being deported, according to Adalah, a legal rights group representing them. The activists had set out to protest Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza, which is among the deadliest and most destructive since World War II, and its restrictions on the entry of humanitarian aid. Both have put the territory of around 2 million Palestinians at risk of famine. WATCH: Former Israeli PM Olmert explains why he believes his country is committing war crimes The Freedom Flotilla Coalition, which organized the voyage, said the activists were \u201ckidnapped by Israeli forces\u201d while trying to deliver desperately needed aid. \u201cThe ship was unlawfully boarded, its unarmed civilian crew abducted and its life-saving cargo \u2014 including baby formula, food and medical supplies \u2014 confiscated,\u201d it said in a statement. It said the ship was seized in international waters about 200 kilometers (120 miles) from Gaza, and Adalah asserted that Israel had \u201cno legal authority\u201d to take it over. Israel\u2019s Foreign Ministry portrayed the voyage as a public relations stunt, saying on social media that \u201cthe \u2018selfie yacht\u2019 of the \u2018celebrities\u2019 is safely making its way to the shores of Israel.\u201d It said the activists would return to their home countries and the aid would be sent to Gaza through established channels. It circulated footage of what appeared to be Israeli military personnel handing out sandwiches and water to the activists, who were wearing life vests. Israel says boat was carrying minimal aid Israeli officials said the flotilla carried what amounted to less than a truckload of aid. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t humanitarian aid. It\u2019s Instagram activism,\u201d Israeli government spokesperson David Mencer said. \u201cMeanwhile, Israel has delivered over 1,200 truckloads in the last two weeks. So who\u2019s really feeding Gaza and who\u2019s really feeding their own ego? Greta was not bringing aid, she was bringing herself.\u201d After its 2\u00bd-month total blockade aimed at pressuring Hamas, Israel started allowing some basic aid into Gaza last month, but humanitarian workers and experts have warned of famine unless the blockade is lifted and Israel ends its military offensive. About 600 trucks of aid entered daily during the ceasefire that Israel ended in March. An attempt last month by Freedom Flotilla to reach Gaza by sea failed after two drones attacked the vessel in international waters off Malta, organizers said. The group blamed Israel for the attack, which damaged the ship\u2019s front section. Rights group questions Israel\u2019s seizure A demonstrator releases colored smoke during a June 9 protest near the Israeli embassy in Athens, following the seizure by Israeli forces of the Gaza-bound charity vessel Madleen, operated by the pro-Palestinian Freedom Flotilla Coalition. Photo by Louisa Gouliamaki/Reuters The Madleen set sail from Sicily a week ago. Along the way, it stopped on Thursday to rescue four migrants who had jumped overboard to avoid being detained by Libya\u2019a coast guard. \u201cI urge all my friends, family and comrades to put pressure on the Swedish government to release me and the others as soon as possible,\u201d Thunberg said in a prerecorded message released after the ship was halted. Adalah, the rights group, said in a statement that \u201cthe arrest of the unarmed activists, who operated in a civilian manner to provide humanitarian aid, amounts to a serious breach of international law.\u201d Rima Hassan, a French member of the European Parliament who is of Palestinian descent, was among those on board. She has been barred from entering Israel because of her opposition to Israeli policies toward the Palestinians. She was among six French citizens on board. French President Emmanuel Macron called for consular protection and the repatriation of the French citizens. \u201cMost of all, France calls for a ceasefire as quickly as possible and the lifting of the humanitarian blockade. This is a scandal, unacceptable, that is playing out in Gaza. What\u2019s been happening since early March is a disgrace, a disgrace,\u201d Macron said Next week, Macron co-hosts a conference at the U.N. on a two-state solution and recently said France should move toward recognizing a Palestinian state. Swedish Foreign Minister Maria Malmer Stenergard said the crew and passengers were aware of the risks, Swedish news agency TT reported. Stenergard said the ministry\u2019s assessment is that no one was in danger and there was no need for consular support. An 18-year blockade on Gaza Israel and Egypt have imposed varying degrees of a blockade on Gaza since Hamas seized power from rival Palestinian forces in 2007. Israel says the blockade is needed to prevent Hamas from importing arms, while critics say it amounts to collective punishment of Gaza\u2019s Palestinian population. Israel sealed off Gaza from all aid in the early days of the war ignited by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, but later relented under U.S. pressure. In early March, shortly before Israel ended a ceasefire with Hamas, the country again blocked all imports, including food, fuel and medicine. Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 attack and abducted 251 hostages. Most have been released in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Hamas still holds 55 hostages, more than half believed to be dead. Israel\u2019s military campaign has killed more than 54,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which doesn\u2019t distinguish between civilians and combatants but has said that women and children make up most of the dead. The war has destroyed vast areas of Gaza and displaced around 90% of the population, leaving people almost completely dependent on international aid. Efforts to broker another truce have been deadlocked for months. Hamas says it will only release the remaining hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal. Israel has vowed to continue the war until all the captives are returned and Hamas is defeated, or disarmed and exiled.

It\u2019s Instagram activism,\u201d Israeli government spokesperson David Mencer said. \u201cMeanwhile, Israel has delivered over 1,200 truckloads in the last two weeks. So who\u2019s really feeding Gaza and who\u2019s really feeding their own ego? Greta was not bringing aid, she was bringing herself.\u201d After its 2\u00bd-month total blockade aimed at pressuring Hamas, Israel started allowing some basic aid into Gaza last month, but humanitarian workers and experts have warned of famine unless the blockade is lifted and Israel ends its military offensive. About 600 trucks of aid entered daily during the ceasefire that Israel ended in March. An attempt last month by Freedom Flotilla to reach Gaza by sea failed after two drones attacked the vessel in international waters off Malta, organizers said. The group blamed Israel for the attack, which damaged the ship\u2019s front section.

Along the way, it stopped on Thursday to rescue four migrants who had jumped overboard to avoid being detained by Libya\u2019a coast guard. \u201cI urge all my friends, family and comrades to put pressure on the Swedish government to release me and the others as soon as possible,\u201d Thunberg said in a prerecorded message released after the ship was halted.

She has been barred from entering Israel because of her opposition to Israeli policies toward the Palestinians. She was among six French citizens on board. French President Emmanuel Macron called for consular protection and the repatriation of the French citizens. \u201cMost of all, France calls for a ceasefire as quickly as possible and the lifting of the humanitarian blockade. This is a scandal, unacceptable, that is playing out in Gaza. What\u2019s been happening since early March is a disgrace, a disgrace,\u201d Macron said Next week, Macron co-hosts a conference at the U.N. on a two-state solution and recently said France should move toward recognizing a Palestinian state. Swedish Foreign Minister Maria Malmer Stenergard said the crew and passengers were aware of the risks, Swedish news agency TT reported. Stenergard said the ministry\u2019s assessment is that no one was in danger and there was no need for consular support. An 18-year blockade on Gaza Israel and Egypt have imposed varying degrees of a blockade on Gaza since Hamas seized power from rival Palestinian forces in 2007. Israel says the blockade is needed to prevent Hamas from importing arms, while critics say it amounts to collective punishment of Gaza\u2019s Palestinian population. Israel sealed off Gaza from all aid in the early days of the war ignited by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, but later relented under U.S. pressure. In early March, shortly before Israel ended a ceasefire with Hamas, the country again blocked all imports, including food, fuel and medicine. Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 attack and abducted 251 hostages. Most have been released in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Hamas still holds 55 hostages, more than half believed to be dead. Israel\u2019s military campaign has killed more than 54,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which doesn\u2019t distinguish between civilians and combatants but has said that women and children make up most of the dead. The war has destroyed vast areas of Gaza and displaced around 90% of the population, leaving people almost completely dependent on international aid. Efforts to broker another truce have been deadlocked for months. Hamas says it will only release the remaining hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal. Israel has vowed to continue the war until all the captives are returned and Hamas is defeated, or disarmed and exiled.

It was an almost unthinkable sight: the home to works by Leonardo da Vinci and millennia of civilization\u2019s greatest treasures \u2014 paralyzed in a strike by the very people tasked with welcoming the world to its galleries. WATCH: Why women are drawn to solo travel and how the tourism industry is responding Thousands of stranded and confused visitors, tickets in hand, were corralled into unmoving lines beneath I.M. Pei\u2019s glass pyramid. \u201cIt\u2019s the Mona Lisa moan out here,\u201d said Kevin Ward, 62, from Milwaukee. \u201cThousands of people waiting, no communication, no explanation. I guess even she needs a day off.\u201d The Louvre has become a symbol of tourism pushed to its limits. As hotspots from Venice to the Acropolis race to curb crowds, the world\u2019s most iconic museum, visited by millions, is hitting a breaking point of its own. Just a day earlier, coordinated anti-tourism protests swept across southern Europe. Thousands rallied in Mallorca, Venice, Lisbon and beyond, denouncing an economic model they say displaces locals and erodes city life. In Barcelona, activists sprayed tourists with water pistols \u2014 a theatrical bid to \u201ccool down\u201d runaway tourism. The Louvre\u2019s spontaneous strike erupted during a routine internal meeting, as gallery attendants, ticket agents and security personnel refused to take up their posts in protest over unmanageable crowds, chronic understaffing and what one union called \u201cuntenable\u201d working conditions. It\u2019s rare for the Louvre to close its doors. It has happened during war, during the pandemic, and in a handful of strikes \u2014 including spontaneous walkouts over overcrowding in 2019 and safety fears in 2013. But seldom has it happened so suddenly, without warning, and in full view of the crowds. What\u2019s more, the disruption comes just months after President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a sweeping decade-long plan to rescue the Louvre from precisely the problems now boiling over \u2014 water leaks, dangerous temperature swings, outdated infrastructure, and foot traffic far beyond what the museum can handle. But for workers on the ground, that promised future feels distant. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait six years for help,\u201d said Sarah Sefian of the CGT-Culture union. \u201cOur teams are under pressure now. It\u2019s not just about the art \u2014 it\u2019s about the people protecting it.\u201d The Mona Lisa\u2019s daily mob At the center of it all is the Mona Lisa \u2014 a 16th-century portrait that draws modern-day crowds more akin to a celebrity meet-and-greet than an art experience. Roughly 20,000 people a day squeeze into the Salle des \u00c9tats, the museum\u2019s largest room, just to snap a selfie with Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s enigmatic woman behind protective glass. The scene is often noisy, jostling, and so dense that many barely glance at the masterpieces flanking her \u2014 works by Titian and Veronese that go largely ignored. WATCH: The uncommon mastermind behind Mona Lisa\u2019s smile \u201cYou don\u2019t see a painting,\u201d said Ji-Hyun Park, 28, who flew from Seoul to Paris. \u201cYou see phones. You see elbows. You feel heat. And then, you\u2019re pushed out.\u201d Macron\u2019s renovation blueprint, dubbed the \u201cLouvre New Renaissance,\u201d promises a remedy. The Mona Lisa will finally get her own dedicated room, accessible through a timed-entry ticket. A new entrance near the Seine River is also planned by 2031 to relieve pressure from the overwhelmed pyramid hub. \u201cConditions of display, explanation and presentation will be up to what the Mona Lisa deserves,\u201d Macron said in January. But Louvre workers call Macron hypocritical and say the \u20ac700\u2013800 million million renovation plan masks a deeper crisis. While Macron is investing in new entrances and exhibition space, the Louvre\u2019s annual operating subsidies from the French state have shrunk by more than 20% over the past decade \u2014 even as visitor numbers soared. \u201cWe take it very badly that Monsieur Le President makes his speeches here in our museum,\u201d Sefian said, \u201cbut when you scratch the surface, the financial investment of the state is getting worse with each passing year.\u201d While many striking staff plan to remain off duty all day, Sefian said some workers may return temporarily to open a limited \u201cmasterpiece route\u201d for a couple of hours, allowing access to select highlights including the Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo. The full museum might reopen as normal on Wednesday, and some tourists with time-sensitive tickets for Monday may be allowed to reuse them then. On Tuesday the Louvre is closed. A museum in limbo The Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors last year \u2014 more than double what its infrastructure was designed to accommodate. Even with a daily cap of 30,000, staff say the experience has become a daily test of endurance, with too few rest areas, limited bathrooms, and summer heat magnified by the pyramid\u2019s greenhouse effect. In a leaked memo, Louvre President Laurence des Cars warned that parts of the building are \u201cno longer watertight,\u201d that temperature fluctuations endanger priceless art, and that even basic visitor needs \u2014 food, restrooms, signage \u2014 fall far below international standards. She described the experience simply as \u201ca physical ordeal.\u201d \u201cWhat began as a scheduled monthly information session turned into a mass expression of exasperation,\u201d Sefian said. Talks between workers and management began at 10:30 a.m. and continued into the afternoon. The full renovation plan is expected to be financed through ticket revenue, private donations, state funds, and licensing fees from the Louvre\u2019s Abu Dhabi branch. Ticket prices for non-EU tourists are expected to rise later this year. But workers say their needs are more urgent than any 10-year plan. Unlike other major sites in Paris, such as Notre Dame cathedral or the Centre Pompidou museum, both of which are undergoing government-backed restorations, the Louvre remains stuck in limbo \u2014 neither fully funded nor fully functional. President Macron, who delivered his 2017 election victory speech at the Louvre and showcased it during the 2024 Paris Olympics, has promised a safer, more modern museum by the end of the decade. Until then, France\u2019s greatest cultural treasure \u2014 and the millions who flock to see it \u2014 remain caught between the cracks.

(AP) \u2014 Leavenworth, Kansas, occupies a mythic space in American crime, its name alone evoking a short hand for serving hard time. The federal penitentiary housed gangsters Al Capone and Machine Gun Kelly \u2014 in a building so storied that it inspired the term \u201cthe big house.\u201d Now Kansas\u2019 oldest city could soon be detaining far less famous people, migrants swept up in President Donald Trump\u2019s promise of mass deportations of those living in the U.S. illegally. READ MORE: Trump administration seeks to turn mass deportations into an efficient business \u2018like Amazon\u2019 The federal government has signed a deal with the private prison firm CoreCivic Corp. to reopen a 1,033-bed prison in Leavenworth as part of a surge of contracts U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has issued without seeking competitive bids. ICE has cited a \u201ccompelling urgency\u201d for thousands more detention beds, and its efforts have sent profit estimates soaring for politically connected private companies, including CoreCivic, based in the Nashville, Tennessee, area and another giant firm, The Geo Group Inc., headquartered in southern Florida. That push faces resistance. Leavenworth filed a lawsuit against CoreCivic after it tried to reopen without city officials signing off on the deal, quoting a federal judge\u2019s past description of the now-shuttered prison as \u201ca hell hole.\u201d The case in Leavenworth serves as another test of the limits of the Republican president\u2019s unusually aggressive tactics to force migrant removals. To get more detention beds, the Trump administration has modified dozens of existing agreements with contractors and used no-bid contracts. One pays $73 million to a company led by former federal immigration officials for \u201cimmigration enforcement support teams\u201d to handle administrative tasks, such as helping coordinate removals, triaging complaints or telling ICE if someone is a risk to community safety. Just last week, Geo Group announced that ICE modified a contract for an existing detention center in southeastern Georgia so that the company could reopen an idle prison on adjacent land to hold 1,868 migrants \u2014 and earn $66 million in annual revenue. \u201cNever in our 42-year company history have we had so much activity and demand for our services as we are seeing right now,\u201d said CoreCivic CEO Damon Hininger during an earnings call last month with shareholders. A tax-cutting and budget reconciliation measure approved last month by the House includes $45 billion over four years for immigrant detention, a threefold spending increase. The Senate is now considering that legislation. Declaring an emergency to expedite contracts When Trump started his second term in January, CoreCivic and Geo had around 20 idle facilities, partly because of sentencing reforms that reduced prison populations. But the Trump administration wants to more than double the existing 41,000 beds for detaining migrants to at least 100,000 beds and \u2014 if private prison executives\u2019 predictions are accurate \u2014 possibly to more than 150,000. ICE declared a national emergency on the U.S. border with Mexico as part of its justification for authorizing nine five-year contracts for a combined 10,312 beds without \u201cFull and Open Competition.\u201d Only three of the nine potential facilities were listed in ICE\u2019s document: Leavenworth, a 2,560-bed CoreCivic-owned facility in California City, California, and an 1,800-bed Geo-owned prison in Baldwin, Michigan. WATCH: \u2018We stand up for our neighbors,\u2019 San Antonio mayor says of protests against ICE raids The agreement for the Leavenworth facility hasn\u2019t been released, nor have documents for the other two sites. CoreCivic and Geo Group officials said last month on earnings calls that ICE used what are known as letter contracts, meant to speed things up when time is critical. Charles Tiefer, a contract expert and professor emeritus of law at the University of Baltimore Law School, said letter contracts normally are reserved for minor matters, not the big changes he sees ICE making to previous agreements. \u201cI think that a letter contract is a pathetic way to make big important contracts,\u201d he said. A Kansas prison town becomes a priority CoreCivic\u2019s Leavenworth facility quickly became a priority for ICE and the company because of its central location. Leavenworth, with 37,000 residents, is only 10 miles (16 kilometers) to the west of the Kansas City International Airport. The facility would hold men and women and is within ICE\u2019s area of operations for Chicago, 420 miles (676 kilometers) to the northeast. \u201cThat would mean that people targeted in the Chicago area and in Illinois would end up going to this facility down in Kansas,\u201d said Jesse Franzblau, a senior policy analyst for the National Immigrant Justice Center. Prisons have long been an important part of Leavenworth\u2019s economy, employing hundreds of workers to guard prisoners held in two military facilities, the nation\u2019s first federal penitentiary, a Kansas correctional facility and a county jail within 6 miles (10 kilometers) of city hall. Resistance from Trump country The Leavenworth area\u2019s politics might have been expected to help CoreCivic. Trump carried its county by more than 20 percentage points in each of his three campaigns for president. But skeptical city officials argue that CoreCivic needs a special use permit to reopen its facility. CoreCivic disagrees, saying that it doesn\u2019t because it never abandoned the facility and that the permitting process would take too long. Leavenworth sued the company to force it to get one, and a state-court judge issued an order requiring it earlier this month. An attorney for the city, Joe Hatley, said the legal fight indicates how much ill will CoreCivic generated when it held criminal suspects there for trials in federal court for the U.S. Marshals Service. In late 2021, CoreCivic stopped housing pretrial detainees in its Leavenworth facility after then-President Joe Biden, a Democrat, called on the U.S. Department of Justice to curb the use of private prisons. In the months before the closure, the American Civil Liberties Union and federal public defenders detailed stabbings, suicides, a homicide and inmate rights violations in a letter to the White House. CoreCivic responded at the time that the claims were \u201cfalse and defamatory.\u201d Vacancies among correctional officers were as high as 23%, according to a Department of Justice report from 2017. \u201cIt was just mayhem,\u201d recalled William Rogers, who worked as a guard at the CoreCivic facility in Leavenworth from 2016 through 2020. He said repeated assaults sent him to the emergency room three times, including once after a blow to the head that required 14 staples. The critics have included a federal judge When Leavenworth sued CoreCivic, it opened its lawsuit with a quote from U.S. District Court Judge Julie Robinson \u2014 an appointee of President George W. Bush, a Republican \u2014 who said of the prison: \u201cThe only way I could describe it frankly, what\u2019s going on at CoreCivic right now is it\u2019s an absolute hell hole.\u201d WATCH: Investigation finds sexual assault claims against immigration officials routinely ignored The city\u2019s lawsuit described detainees locked in showers as punishment. It said that sheets and towels from the facility clogged up the wastewater system and that CoreCivic impeded the city police force\u2019s ability to investigate sexual assaults and other violent crimes. The facility had no inmates when CoreCivic gave reporters a tour earlier this year, and it looked scrubbed top to bottom and the smell of disinfectant hung in the air. One unit for inmates had a painting on one wall featuring a covered wagon. During the tour, when asked about the allegations of past problems, Misty Mackey, a longtime CoreCivic employee who was tapped to serve as warden there, apologized for past employees\u2019 experiences and said the company officials \u201cdo our best to make sure that we learn from different situations.\u201d ICE moves quickly across the U.S. Besides CoreCivic\u2019s Leavenworth prison, other once-shuttered facilities could come online near major immigrant population centers, from New York to Los Angeles, to help Trump fulfill his deportation plans. ICE wants to reopen existing facilities because it\u2019s faster than building new ones, said Marcela Hernandez, the organizing director for the Detention Watch Network, which has organized nationwide protests against ICE detention. Counties often lease out jail space for immigrant detention, but ICE said some jurisdictions have passed ordinances barring that. ICE has used contract modifications to reopen shuttered lockups like the 1,000-bed Delaney Hall Facility in Newark, New Jersey, and a 2,500-bed facility in Dilley, Texas, offering no explanations why new, competitively bid contracts weren\u2019t sought. WATCH: Georgia teen says ICE detention was \u2018life-altering\u2019 and \u2018like a prison\u2019 The Newark facility, with its own history of problems, resumed intakes May 1, and disorder broke out at the facility Thursday night. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, a Democrat who previously was arrested there and accused of trespassing, cited reports of a possible uprising, and the Department of Homeland Security confirmed four escapes. The contract modification for Dilley, which was built to hold families and resumed operations in March, calls its units \u201cneighborhoods\u201d and gives them names like Brown Bear and Blue Butterfly. The financial details for the Newark and Dilley contract modifications are blacked out in online copies, as they for more than 50 other agreements ICE has signed since Trump took office. ICE didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. From idle prisons to a \u2018gold rush\u2019 Private prison executives are forecasting hundreds of millions of dollars in new ICE profits. Since Trump\u2019s reelection in November, CoreCivic\u2019s stock has risen in price by 56% and Geo\u2019s by 73%. \u201cIt\u2019s the gold rush,\u201d Michael A. Hallett, a professor of criminal justice at the University of North Florida who studies private prisons. \u201cAll of a sudden, demand is spiraling. And when you\u2019re the only provider that can meet demand, you can pretty much set your terms.\u201d Geo\u2019s former lobbyist Pam Bondi is now the U.S. attorney general. It anticipates that all of its idle prisons will be activated this year, its executive chairman, George Zoley, told shareholders. CoreCivic, which along with Geo donated millions of dollars to largely GOP candidates at all levels of government and national political groups, is equally optimistic. It began daily talks with the Trump administration immediately after the election in November, said Hininger. CoreCivic officials said ICE\u2019s letter contracts provide initial funding to begin reopening facilities while the company negotiates a longer-term deal. The Leavenworth deal is worth $4.2 million a month to the company, it disclosed in a court filing. Tiefer, who served on an independent commission established to study government contracting for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, said ICE is \u201cplacing a very dicey long-term bet\u201d because of its past problems and said ICE is giving CoreCivic \u201cthe keys to the treasury\u201d without competition. But financial analysts on company earnings calls have been delighted. When CoreCivic announced its letter contracts, Joe Gomes, of the financial services firm Noble Capital Markets, responded with, \u201cGreat news.\u201d \u201cAre you hiding any more of them on us?\u201d he asked.

But skeptical city officials argue that CoreCivic needs a special use permit to reopen its facility. CoreCivic disagrees, saying that it doesn\u2019t because it never abandoned the facility and that the permitting process would take too long. Leavenworth sued the company to force it to get one, and a state-court judge issued an order requiring it earlier this month. An attorney for the city, Joe Hatley, said the legal fight indicates how much ill will CoreCivic generated when it held criminal suspects there for trials in federal court for the U.S. Marshals Service. In late 2021, CoreCivic stopped housing pretrial detainees in its Leavenworth facility after then-President Joe Biden, a Democrat, called on the U.S. Department of Justice to curb the use of private prisons. In the months before the closure, the American Civil Liberties Union and federal public defenders detailed stabbings, suicides, a homicide and inmate rights violations in a letter to the White House. CoreCivic responded at the time that the claims were \u201cfalse and defamatory.\u201d Vacancies among correctional officers were as high as 23%, according to a Department of Justice report from 2017. \u201cIt was just mayhem,\u201d recalled William Rogers, who worked as a guard at the CoreCivic facility in Leavenworth from 2016 through 2020. He said repeated assaults sent him to the emergency room three times, including once after a blow to the head that required 14 staples. The critics have included a federal judge When Leavenworth sued CoreCivic, it opened its lawsuit with a quote from U.S. District Court Judge Julie Robinson \u2014 an appointee of President George W. Bush, a Republican \u2014 who said of the prison: \u201cThe only way I could describe it frankly, what\u2019s going on at CoreCivic right now is it\u2019s an absolute hell hole.\u201d WATCH: Investigation finds sexual assault claims against immigration officials routinely ignored The city\u2019s lawsuit described detainees locked in showers as punishment. It said that sheets and towels from the facility clogged up the wastewater system and that CoreCivic impeded the city police force\u2019s ability to investigate sexual assaults and other violent crimes. The facility had no inmates when CoreCivic gave reporters a tour earlier this year, and it looked scrubbed top to bottom and the smell of disinfectant hung in the air. One unit for inmates had a painting on one wall featuring a covered wagon. During the tour, when asked about the allegations of past problems, Misty Mackey, a longtime CoreCivic employee who was tapped to serve as warden there, apologized for past employees\u2019 experiences and said the company officials \u201cdo our best to make sure that we learn from different situations.\u201d ICE moves quickly across the U.S. Besides CoreCivic\u2019s Leavenworth prison, other once-shuttered facilities could come online near major immigrant population centers, from New York to Los Angeles, to help Trump fulfill his deportation plans. ICE wants to reopen existing facilities because it\u2019s faster than building new ones, said Marcela Hernandez, the organizing director for the Detention Watch Network, which has organized nationwide protests against ICE detention. Counties often lease out jail space for immigrant detention, but ICE said some jurisdictions have passed ordinances barring that. ICE has used contract modifications to reopen shuttered lockups like the 1,000-bed Delaney Hall Facility in Newark, New Jersey, and a 2,500-bed facility in Dilley, Texas, offering no explanations why new, competitively bid contracts weren\u2019t sought.

(AP) \u2014 Leavenworth, Kansas, occupies a mythic space in American crime, its name alone evoking a short hand for serving hard time. The federal penitentiary housed gangsters Al Capone and Machine Gun Kelly \u2014 in a building so storied that it inspired the term \u201cthe big house.\u201d Now Kansas\u2019 oldest city could soon be detaining far less famous people, migrants swept up in President Donald Trump\u2019s promise of mass deportations of those living in the U.S. illegally. READ MORE: Trump administration seeks to turn mass deportations into an efficient business \u2018like Amazon\u2019 The federal government has signed a deal with the private prison firm CoreCivic Corp. to reopen a 1,033-bed prison in Leavenworth as part of a surge of contracts U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has issued without seeking competitive bids. ICE has cited a \u201ccompelling urgency\u201d for thousands more detention beds, and its efforts have sent profit estimates soaring for politically connected private companies, including CoreCivic, based in the Nashville, Tennessee, area and another giant firm, The Geo Group Inc., headquartered in southern Florida. That push faces resistance. Leavenworth filed a lawsuit against CoreCivic after it tried to reopen without city officials signing off on the deal, quoting a federal judge\u2019s past description of the now-shuttered prison as \u201ca hell hole.\u201d The case in Leavenworth serves as another test of the limits of the Republican president\u2019s unusually aggressive tactics to force migrant removals. To get more detention beds, the Trump administration has modified dozens of existing agreements with contractors and used no-bid contracts. One pays $73 million to a company led by former federal immigration officials for \u201cimmigration enforcement support teams\u201d to handle administrative tasks, such as helping coordinate removals, triaging complaints or telling ICE if someone is a risk to community safety. Just last week, Geo Group announced that ICE modified a contract for an existing detention center in southeastern Georgia so that the company could reopen an idle prison on adjacent land to hold 1,868 migrants \u2014 and earn $66 million in annual revenue. \u201cNever in our 42-year company history have we had so much activity and demand for our services as we are seeing right now,\u201d said CoreCivic CEO Damon Hininger during an earnings call last month with shareholders. A tax-cutting and budget reconciliation measure approved last month by the House includes $45 billion over four years for immigrant detention, a threefold spending increase. The Senate is now considering that legislation. Declaring an emergency to expedite contracts When Trump started his second term in January, CoreCivic and Geo had around 20 idle facilities, partly because of sentencing reforms that reduced prison populations. But the Trump administration wants to more than double the existing 41,000 beds for detaining migrants to at least 100,000 beds and \u2014 if private prison executives\u2019 predictions are accurate \u2014 possibly to more than 150,000. ICE declared a national emergency on the U.S. border with Mexico as part of its justification for authorizing nine five-year contracts for a combined 10,312 beds without \u201cFull and Open Competition.\u201d Only three of the nine potential facilities were listed in ICE\u2019s document: Leavenworth, a 2,560-bed CoreCivic-owned facility in California City, California, and an 1,800-bed Geo-owned prison in Baldwin, Michigan. WATCH: \u2018We stand up for our neighbors,\u2019 San Antonio mayor says of protests against ICE raids The agreement for the Leavenworth facility hasn\u2019t been released, nor have documents for the other two sites. CoreCivic and Geo Group officials said last month on earnings calls that ICE used what are known as letter contracts, meant to speed things up when time is critical. Charles Tiefer, a contract expert and professor emeritus of law at the University of Baltimore Law School, said letter contracts normally are reserved for minor matters, not the big changes he sees ICE making to previous agreements. \u201cI think that a letter contract is a pathetic way to make big important contracts,\u201d he said. A Kansas prison town becomes a priority CoreCivic\u2019s Leavenworth facility quickly became a priority for ICE and the company because of its central location. Leavenworth, with 37,000 residents, is only 10 miles (16 kilometers) to the west of the Kansas City International Airport. The facility would hold men and women and is within ICE\u2019s area of operations for Chicago, 420 miles (676 kilometers) to the northeast. \u201cThat would mean that people targeted in the Chicago area and in Illinois would end up going to this facility down in Kansas,\u201d said Jesse Franzblau, a senior policy analyst for the National Immigrant Justice Center. Prisons have long been an important part of Leavenworth\u2019s economy, employing hundreds of workers to guard prisoners held in two military facilities, the nation\u2019s first federal penitentiary, a Kansas correctional facility and a county jail within 6 miles (10 kilometers) of city hall.

One pays $73 million to a company led by former federal immigration officials for \u201cimmigration enforcement support teams\u201d to handle administrative tasks, such as helping coordinate removals, triaging complaints or telling ICE if someone is a risk to community safety.\nJust last week , Geo Group announced that ICE modified a contract for an existing detention center in southeastern Georgia so that the company could reopen an idle prison on adjacent land to hold 1,868 migrants \u2014 and earn $66 million in annual revenue.\n\u201cNever in our 42-year company history have we had so much activity and demand for our services as we are seeing right now,\u201d said CoreCivic CEO Damon Hininger during an earnings call last month with shareholders.\nA tax-cutting and budget reconciliation measure approved last month by the House includes $45 billion over four years for immigrant detention, a threefold spending increase. The Senate is now considering that legislation.\nWhen Trump started his second term in January, CoreCivic and Geo had around 20 idle facilities, partly because of sentencing reforms that reduced prison populations. But the Trump administration wants to more than double the existing 41,000 beds for detaining migrants to at least 100,000 beds and \u2014 if private prison executives' predictions are accurate \u2014 possibly to more than 150,000.\nICE declared a national emergency on the U.S. border with Mexico as part of its justification for authorizing nine five-year contracts for a combined 10,312 beds without \u201cFull and Open Competition.\u201d\nOnly three of the nine potential facilities were listed in ICE\u2019s document: Leavenworth, a 2,560-bed CoreCivic-owned facility in California City, California, and an 1,800-bed Geo-owned prison in Baldwin, Michigan.\nThe agreement for the Leavenworth facility hasn\u2019t been released, nor have documents for the other two sites. CoreCivic and Geo Group officials said last month on earnings calls that ICE used what are known as letter contracts, meant to speed things up when time is critical.\nCharles Tiefer, a contract expert and professor emeritus of law at the University of Baltimore Law School, said letter contracts normally are reserved for minor matters, not the big changes he sees ICE making to previous agreements.\n\u201cI think that a letter contract is a pathetic way to make big important contracts,\u201d he said.\nCoreCivic's Leavenworth facility quickly became a priority for ICE and the company because of its central location. Leavenworth, with 37,000 residents, is only 10 miles (16 kilometers) to the west of the Kansas City International Airport. The facility would hold men and women and is within ICE\u2019s area of operations for Chicago, 420 miles (676 kilometers) to the northeast.\n\u201cThat would mean that people targeted in the Chicago area and in Illinois would end up going to this facility down in Kansas,\u201d said Jesse Franzblau, a senior policy analyst for the National Immigrant Justice Center.\nPrisons have long been an important part of Leavenworth's economy, employing hundreds of workers to guard prisoners held in two military facilities, the nation\u2019s first federal penitentiary, a Kansas correctional facility and a county jail within 6 miles (10 kilometers) of city hall.\nThe Leavenworth area's politics might have been expected to help CoreCivic. Trump carried its county by more than 20 percentage points in each of his three campaigns for president.\nBut skeptical city officials argue that CoreCivic needs a special use permit to reopen its facility. CoreCivic disagrees, saying that it doesn't because it never abandoned the facility and that the permitting process would take too long. Leavenworth sued the company to force it to get one, and a state-court judge last week issued an order requiring it.\nAn attorney for the city, Joe Hatley, said the legal fight indicates how much ill will CoreCivic generated when it held criminal suspects there for trials in federal court for the U.S. Marshals Service.\nIn late 2021, CoreCivic stopped housing pretrial detainees in its Leavenworth facility after then-President Joe Biden, a Democrat, called on the U.S. Department of Justice to curb the use of private prisons. In the months before the closure, the American Civil Liberties Union and federal public defenders detailed stabbings, suicides, a homicide and inmate rights violations in a letter to the White House. CoreCivic responded at the time that the claims were \u201cfalse and defamatory.\u201d\nVacancies among correctional officers were as high as 23%, according to a Department of Justice report from 2017.\n\u201cIt was just mayhem,\u201d recalled William Rogers, who worked as a guard at the CoreCivic facility in Leavenworth from 2016 through 2020. He said repeated assaults sent him to the emergency room three times, including once after a blow to the head that required 14 staples.\nWhen Leavenworth sued CoreCivic, it opened its lawsuit with a quote from U.S. District Court Judge Julie Robinson \u2014 an appointee of President George W. Bush, a Republican \u2014 who said of the prison: \u201cThe only way I could describe it frankly, what\u2019s going on at CoreCivic right now is it\u2019s an absolute hell hole.\u201d\nThe city\u2019s lawsuit described detainees locked in showers as punishment. It said that sheets and towels from the facility clogged up the wastewater system and that CoreCivic impeded the city police force\u2019s ability to investigate sexual assaults and other violent crimes.\nThe facility had no inmates when CoreCivic gave reporters a tour earlier this year, and it looked scrubbed top to bottom and the smell of disinfectant hung in the air. One unit for inmates had a painting on one wall featuring a covered wagon.\nDuring the tour, when asked about the allegations of past problems, Misty Mackey, a longtime CoreCivic employee who was tapped to serve as warden there, apologized for past employees' experiences and said the company officials \u201cdo our best to make sure that we learn from different situations.\u201d\nBesides CoreCivic\u2019s Leavenworth prison, other once-shuttered facilities could come online near major immigrant population centers, from New York to Los Angeles, to help Trump fulfill his deportation plans.\nICE wants to reopen existing facilities because it\u2019s faster than building new ones, said Marcela Hernandez, the organizing director for the Detention Watch Network, which has organized nationwide protests against ICE detention.\nCounties often lease out jail space for immigrant detention, but ICE said some jurisdictions have passed ordinances barring that.\nICE has used contract modifications to reopen shuttered lockups like the 1,000-bed Delaney Hall Facility in Newark, New Jersey, and a 2,500-bed facility in Dilley, Texas, offering no explanations why new, competitively bid contracts weren't sought.\nThe Newark facility, with its own history of problems, resumed intakes May 1, and disorder broke out at the facility Thursday night. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, a Democrat who previously was arrested there and accused of trespassing, cited reports of a possible uprising, and the Department of Homeland Security confirmed four escapes.\nThe contract modification for Dilley, which was built to hold families and resumed operations in March, calls its units \u201cneighborhoods\u201d and gives them names like Brown Bear and Blue Butterfly.\nThe financial details for the Newark and Dilley contract modifications are blacked out in online copies, as they for more than 50 other agreements ICE has signed since Trump took office. ICE didn't respond to a request for comment.\nPrivate prison executives are forecasting hundreds of millions of dollars in new ICE profits. Since Trump\u2019s reelection in November, CoreCivic\u2019s stock has risen in price by 56% and Geo\u2019s by 73%.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the gold rush,\u201d Michael A. Hallett, a professor of criminal justice at the University of North Florida who studies private prisons. \u201cAll of a sudden, demand is spiraling. And when you\u2019re the only provider that can meet demand, you can pretty much set your terms.\u201d\nGeo's former lobbyist Pam Bondi is now the U.S. attorney general. It anticipates that all of its idle prisons will be activated this year, its executive chairman, George Zoley, told shareholders.\nCoreCivic, which along with Geo donated millions of dollars to largely GOP candidates at all levels of government and national political groups, is equally optimistic. It began daily talks with the Trump administration immediately after the election in November, said Hininger.\nCoreCivic officials said ICE's letter contracts provide initial funding to begin reopening facilities while the company negotiates a longer-term deal. The Leavenworth deal is worth $4.2 million a month to the company, it disclosed in a court filing.\nTiefer, who served on an independent commission established to study government contracting for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, said ICE is \"placing a very dicey long-term bet\u201d because of its past problems and said ICE is giving CoreCivic \u201cthe keys to the treasury\u201d without competition.\nBut financial analysts on company earnings calls have been delighted. When CoreCivic announced its letter contracts, Joe Gomes, of the financial services firm Noble Capital Markets, responded with, \u201cGreat news.\"\n\u201cAre you hiding any more of them on us?\u201d he asked.\n___\nHanna reported from Topeka, Kan.

After a brief pause in communications with Voyager 1, NASA re-established a connection with the interstellar spacecraft located more than 15 billion miles away from Earth, using a frequency not used more than forty years.\nCommunication between NASA and Voyager 1 has been spotty at times. In fact, the spacecraft stopped sending readable data to NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California on Nov. 14, 2023, and it was not until April that mission controllers began receiving commands once again.\nMore recently, the spacecraft turned off one of its two transmitters after what engineers suspected was due to Voyager 1\u2019s fault protection system, which autonomously responds to onboard issues.\nFor instance, if the spacecraft uses too much power from its supply source, fault protection will kick in to conserve power by turning off non-essential systems, NASA explained.\nVOYAGER 1 DETECTS \u2018HUM\u2019 WHILE IN INTERSTELLAR SPACE: REPORT\nThe space agency said the flight team sent a command to activate one of the spacecraft\u2019s heaters on Oct. 16. The command takes nearly 23 hours to travel from Earth to the spacecraft, and then another 23 hours for the data to travel back.\nEngineers suspected Voyager 1 should have had plenty of power to operate the heather, though the fault protection system was triggered.\nOn Oct. 18, the team learned about the issue, because the Deep Space Network was unable to detect Voyager 1\u2019s signal. Communication between NASA and the spacecraft occurs on the X-band radio transmitter, named for the frequency it uses.\nNASA PUBLISHES NEVER-BEFORE-SEEN PHOTOS OF \u2018RAVIOLI\u2019 MOON ORBITING SATURN\nThe fault protection system lowered the rate the transmitter was able to send data back to NASA, engineers determined, therefore changing the X-band signal the Deep Space Network needed to listen for.\nOnce the signal was located, Voyager 1 appeared to be in a stable state and the team began investigating what happened.\nBut on Oct. 19, communication between the team and Voyager 1 stopped again, this time entirely.\nThe team believed Voyager 1\u2019s fault protection system was triggered two more times and switched to a second radio transmitter called the S-band, which uses less power.\nNASA RE-ESTABLISHES COMMUNICATION WITH VOYAGER 1 INTERSTELLAR SPACECRAFT THAT WENT SILENT FOR MONTHS\nVoyager 1 had not used the S-band to communicate with Earth since 1981.\nEngineers with the Deep Space Network were ultimately able to detect the spacecraft\u2019s communication from the S-band. Rather than risk turning the X-band back on before finding out what caused the fault protection system to trigger, the team sent a command on Oct. 22 to confirm the S-band transmitter was working.\nNow, the team is working to gather information to help them find out what happened so it can return Voyager 1 back to normal operations.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nVoyager 1\u2032s odyssey began in 1977 when the spacecraft and its twin, Voyager 2, were launched on a tour of the gas giant planets of the solar system.\nAfter beaming back dazzling postcard views of Jupiter\u2019s giant red spot and Saturn\u2019s shimmering rings, Voyager 2 hopscotched to Uranus and Neptune.

There\u2019s no way to screen for so-called ovarian cancer, no colonoscopy, mammogram, or Pap smear equivalent. It\u2019s typically found late, once it\u2019s already spread. The treatments are middling at best. Among the best tools is surgical prevention: If someone doesn\u2019t want more kids, and is considering another abdominal surgery, a surgeon can offer to take the tubes out.\nOpportunistic salpingectomy, it\u2019s called. \u201cSomebody says, \u2018Can I get my tubes tied?\u2019 And I will say, \u2018Well, actually, we don\u2019t tie tubes anymore, we remove them,\u2019\u201d said Greg Marchand, an OB-GYN in Mesa, Ariz. There are exceptions, but generally, since the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommended offering it in 2015, he\u2019s gone with salpingectomy.\nYet if Stone feels the need to proselytize about it, it\u2019s because she often meets doctors who don\u2019t know about it. She remembers her surprise when she clicked into a virtual meeting in 2023 with medical bureaucrats whose jobs involve tracking diagnoses and interventions. \u201cThere were hundreds of people on this call, lots of them medical coders \u2014 people who are familiar with the development of new coding for new discoveries \u2014 and they had never heard of this. No one,\u201d Stone said.\nConfusion abounded. Salpingectomies were documented as tubal ligations; patients didn\u2019t know whether their tubes had been blocked off or completely removed. Beneath those ambiguities was a wonkier one. In the lexicon doctors use to chronicle and bill for their work, there were no medical codes specific to opportunistic salpingectomy.\nNow, after two years of advocating, Stone has convinced the committee behind the American diagnostic bible to create those codes. When they come into use in October, she hopes it will help clarify what patients are signing up for. That\u2019s part of her mission: To give true consent, people need to understand the difference between these procedures \u2014 and the cancer risk that had set this whole change in motion to begin with.\nIt started in the 1990s, with a different kind of risk-reducing surgery. Geneticists had discovered that mutations in BRCA genes drastically increased the rates of certain tumors, mothers and aunts and sisters all born without a molecular tool for repairing damaged DNA, all dying of breast and ovarian cancer. For their surviving relatives, surgeons began offering to remove those tissues. It was invasive and awful, and in the case of ovaries, caused sudden menopause, which carried a host of complications. But it might just save their lives.\nPathologists, meanwhile, began examining the tissues that had been excised. If they could figure out where the tumors began, they might see how better to detect and treat them. The trouble was, they never found consistent precursors in the ovary. The cancers clung to its surface, but the seeds seemed to be coming from elsewhere. There was some hypothesizing that they emerged in the fallopian tube, but it seemed far-fetched. The tube was just a backdrop for the drama of fertilization, a mere conduit connecting uterus and ovary.\n\u201cI came to a meeting probably around 2003, and I got up and said I didn\u2019t think it happened,\u201d said Christopher Crum, a pathologist at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital. He\u2019d examined plenty of tubes in his time, and seen little to suggest that\u2019s where cancers arose.\nBut then he started having second thoughts. Like others, he\u2019d been examining a smidgen of the tube, cut from the middle. What if that were the wrong place? Each tube was 4 or 5 inches long, and wasn\u2019t uniform. It was a widening flume with tentacle-like fringes at the end: a Dr. Seussian cross between a medieval trumpet and a sea anemone. Crum wondered what he would find if he sectioned and inspected the whole thing.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting to get knocked over,\u201d he said \u2014 but within six weeks, he\u2019d found five early cancers, mostly in the fringes he normally would have thrown away. In the previous decade, he hadn\u2019t found any. Pathologists hadn\u2019t seen anything in the tubes because they hadn\u2019t truly been looking.\nThis wasn\u2019t unique to people with BRCA mutations. The tubes of women with average cancer risk, it turned out, sometimes had potential precursors: cells that looked largely healthy but had telltale signs of DNA damage. Most wouldn\u2019t go on to become cancers, but carried that sliver of a threat. When researchers in Vancouver examined the tubes of 12 consecutive ovarian cancer patients, they saw that threat borne out: Every single one had either those DNA-damaged cells, oncologist Dianne Miller recalled, \u201cor the fallopian tube had been totally blown apart.\u201d\nWhy so many cancers begin in the tube still isn\u2019t entirely clear, but one hypothesis has to do with ovulation. The less often someone ovulates \u2014 because of pregnancy, say, or birth control pills \u2014 the lower their risk of ovarian cancer. It makes a certain kind of sense, given the DNA damage involved: \u201cIn order for that egg to kind of ooze or burst out of the ovary, it has to essentially erode some of the layers of the ovary itself,\u201d explained Ronny Drapkin, a pathologist at the University of Pennsylvania.\nThe tasseled end of the fallopian tube hovers right there, draped over the ovary, ready to catch the egg and swish it toward potential fertilization, and, eventually, the uterus. It gets a repeated dose of the tissue-eroding chemical cocktail that allows for ovulation, and its cells may be less well equipped to deal with molecular injury than others.\nWhatever the cause, there was a growing consensus that most so-called ovarian cancers had a similar backstory. It started with quiet DNA damage going unrepaired in one fallopian tube, pushing cells into proliferating wildly, breaking free of the membrane they usually clung to for survival. Some migrated out to colonize the ovarian surface, and from there, spread further into the pelvic cavity. People with BRCA mutations were more susceptible, with the double whammy of normal wear and tear plus a faulty internal fix-it crew. But it happened in others, too. By the time the symptoms were noticeable, it was often too late.\nBy 2010, the idea of removing tubes was cemented in Miller\u2019s mind. She was a gynecologic oncologist at the University of British Columbia, and knew that vast numbers of women got pelvic surgeries. For some, it was a hysterectomy to treat fibroids or heavy menstrual bleeding: removing the uterus, which connects to the tubes\u2019 narrow ends. For others, it was a tubal ligation \u2014 colloquially, \u201ctube-tying\u201d \u2014 a sterilization procedure that involved severing, blocking, or clamping a tiny bit of the tube. To Miller, those surgeries were opportunities: a chance to remove cancer precursors before they arose.\nWhen her team looked at the medical records of British Columbians who\u2019d had ovarian cancer, some 40% of them had previously had one of those operations. That represented thousands of potentially preventable cancers. \u201cThat was part of the impetus,\u201d said Gillian Hanley, an epidemiologist at the University of British Columbia. \u201cThis was worth trying, because people were so tired of watching women die from ovarian cancer. They were willing to try anything.\u201d\nSo began a province-wide campaign, with Miller asking surgeons to suggest salpingectomy to anyone considering either hysterectomy or tubal ligation. Ovarian cancer is rare enough \u2014 and often occurs late enough in life \u2014 that it would take years to see any statistically meaningful decrease in cases. In the meantime, opportunistic salpingectomy started taking root. The Canadian society representing gynecologic oncologists recommended offering it in 2011. The American equivalent did the same in 2013. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists got on board two years later.\nAlready, there were hopeful data. In Sweden, researchers dug through decades of records of tubes excised for other reasons: an abscess, an ectopic pregnancy. Those who\u2019d had both tubes removed had half the ovarian cancer risk of those who\u2019d had only one tube out, as if the surgery were a preventive drug, more effective in its full dose.\nMiller and Hanley\u2019s results, when they came in 2022, suggested the same thing. If the nearly 26,000 British Columbians who\u2019d opted for opportunistic salpingectomy had gotten the most common and deadliest form of ovarian cancer at the same rate as the control group \u2014 who\u2019d kept their tubes \u2014 there should have been at least five cases. Instead, there were zero.\nThis wasn\u2019t just an artifact of salpingectomy-choosers smoking less, exercising more, and being less cancer-prone overall. Their rates of breast and colorectal tumors were the same as the control group\u2019s. Rather, though it sounded drastic to some, opportunistic salpingectomy seemed like a potential boon for public health.\nLook at the uptake statistics, and you might be surprised at Stone\u2019s quest to publicize salpingectomy. There\u2019s already been a massive increase. From 2010 to 2017, among Americans with private insurance, salpingectomy rates jumped 18-fold during sterilizations and 8-fold during non-cancer-related hysterectomies. When STAT asked medical records giant Epic\u2019s research arm for more recent data on tubal removals replacing tube-tying, the company reported that there were 115 salpingectomies for every 100 tubal ligations in 2015, and 332 salpingectomies for every 100 tubal ligations in 2024.\nBut Stone was worried about what lurked behind those crisp-seeming numbers. Epic Research reported running into the same issues. In some cases, it was impossible to know whether a patient had gotten a tubal ligation or a salpingectomy.\nPartially, it was a question of translation. To get reimbursed, American doctors report what happened in a clinical encounter using two different codes, one describing the diagnosis, the why of the visit, and another describing the services rendered, what they did about it. But certain \u201cwhat\u201d codes didn\u2019t distinguish between ligating a small bit of the tube and removing the organ entirely, and there were no \u201cwhy\u201d codes that captured some patients\u2019 cancer-prevention rationale when going in for another surgery.\nThis being the United States, the problem is exacerbated by insurance hurdles. Some state Medicaid programs explicitly won\u2019t pay for salpingectomy for sterilization purposes; some private insurers deny those claims, too. The National Women\u2019s Law Center estimates that its contraception coverage hotline gets about 20 to 25 intakes a week, and three quarters of them are about issues with salpingectomy.\nThe very thing that makes it alluring to doctors and patients alike \u2014 permanent contraception and cancer prevention in one fell swoop \u2014 doesn\u2019t compute in insurer-speak. \u201cThe insurer will be like, \u2018We can\u2019t cover it, because this is not a preventive code. We\u2019ll cover it if your doctor changes it to a preventive code.\u2019 And so they go to their doctor, and their doctor is like, \u2018I can\u2019t change it, I coded it correctly,\u2019\u201d explained Lauren Wallace, a lawyer at the center. \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute mess.\u201d\nThere\u2019s also evidence of deliberate fudging, patients counseling each other on Reddit to ask their doctors to perform salpingectomies but code them as tubal ligations, to get around insurance denials.\nOn the flip side, some patients don\u2019t know exactly what surgery they\u2019ve gotten until after the fact. Tonya Gegenheimer, a bail bond agent and mother of three in Monrovia, La., only discovered she no longer had any tubes when she contacted a surgeon about getting her tubal ligation reversed, an operation that involves suturing the severed ends of the tube back together. \u201cI was asked to get my operative and pathology report, and when I brought that to my appointment, he said, \u2018Unfortunately, you\u2019re not a candidate for reversal. They removed everything,\u2019\u201d Gegenheimer said. \u201cThat was not what I wanted. That was not the terminology that I agreed upon. I was very distraught.\u201d\nShe is part of an online community of patients who\u2019ve experienced a constellation of debilitating symptoms \u2014 abdominal pain, heavy menstrual bleeding, mood swings, brain fog \u2014 after a tubal ligation or salpingectomy, and can\u2019t shake the feeling that this mysterious syndrome was caused by the sterilization. Though it doesn\u2019t always work to restore fertility, which is the primary reason doctors offer it, to these patients, reversal is a way to potentially ease their symptoms. You can\u2019t reverse a tubal removal, though, and some worry about the trend toward salpingectomy.\nThey know that the syndrome they describe is controversial, and often dismissed by doctors: There\u2019s robust safety data on both sterilization procedures, and the complication rates are low. But what this community wants, besides recognition and relief, is more in-depth consent, such that patients know in greater detail \u2014 and in advance \u2014 what each surgery involves.\nStone wants that, too. She\u2019s often appalled at how poorly doctors explain procedures to patients, how often women know they\u2019ve had a hysterectomy but aren\u2019t sure whether they still have ovaries or tubes, how often they know they\u2019ve had a \u201csterilization\u201d but aren\u2019t sure what exactly that means. So, in 2023, she proposed new \u201cwhy\u201d codes for opportunistic salpingectomy. She hoped it might boost insurance coverage, but also knowledge about the procedure beyond OB-GYNs. \u201cThe most real things in medicine are the things you can bill for,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how great the discovery is. If people can\u2019t access this cancer prevention, you\u2019re dead in the water.\u201d\nNow, after two years of work, those codes will be published in the coming weeks, and come into use in October. Doctors will have the bureaucratic terminology to convey the distinction between these operations to insurers \u2014 and Stone is gearing up for more campaigning, so that that distinction gets transmitted not just in code but in plain English (and other languages), too. She wants patients to know that salpingectomy can significantly reduce the risk of certain ovarian cancers, but doesn\u2019t eliminate it entirely. There are subtypes that begin elsewhere. There could be rare instances in which a tube is removed after a mutated cell has already floated out of the tasseled opening and seeded itself on the outside of the ovary.\nThere are other places this procedure could go. Research is underway to understand if it might protect BRCA-mutation carriers against so-called ovarian cancers, allowing some to avoid the sudden menopause that comes with ovary removal. For now, though, Stone mostly wants patients to know what\u2019s in the most basic names their doctors bandy about. That \u201covarian cancer\u201d isn\u2019t always as ovarian as it sounds. That \u201csterilization\u201d can mean different things. Only then, can patients actually choose.", "Rare cancer diagnoses surge dramatically among millennials and Gen X.

Several young celebrities have announced breast cancer diagnoses in the past year \u2014 a public reminder that rates are rising among women under 50 in the U.S.\nPop singer Jessie J, 37, revealed last week on Instagram that she has early-stage breast cancer and plans to undergo surgery this month. Katie Thurston, former star of \u201cThe Bachelorette,\u201d has documented her journey with Stage 4 breast cancer on social media after being diagnosed this year at age 34. And actor Danielle Fishel, known for her role on the \u201990s sitcom \u201cBoy Meets World,\u201d revealed her diagnosis at age 43 to fans last summer.\nNew breast cancer diagnoses in young women have gone up considerably in the last decade. From 2012 to 2021 \u2014 the most recent decade of data \u2014 the rate increased 1.4% annually in women under 50, compared with 0.7% annually in women 50 and up.\nThe trend applies to all racial or ethnic groups, particularly Asian American and Pacific Islander women under 50, for whom diagnoses have risen nearly 50% since 2000. Black women have the highest rate of breast cancer before age 40 and are most likely to die of the disease.\nWomen under 40 generally aren\u2019t advised to get mammograms unless they have a strong risk factor for breast cancer, such as a family history or genetic mutation. In that case, the American Cancer Society recommends mammograms starting at age 30, plus an annual breast MRI.\nSeveral breast cancer doctors said younger patients and their clinicians should be careful not to dismiss symptoms such as a lump or nipple discharge.\n\u201cThe thought was always, if you had a change in your breast but you were a young woman, it was probably nothing,\u201d said Dr. Rani Bansal, an assistant professor at the Duke University School of Medicine. \u201cAs we\u2019re seeing more and more younger women get diagnosed \u2026 we need to take these cases seriously.\u201d\nDr. Oluwadamilola Fayanju, chief of breast surgery at Penn Medicine, said her youngest patient diagnosed with cancer was just 17. She recommended that young women with symptoms go to a center that\u2019s experienced in breast imaging.\nFor women with an elevated risk of breast cancer, she said, \u201cit may be better for you to be connected with a dedicated breast provider who can keep a close eye on you and do regular exams even well before 40.\u201d\nBreast cancer in young women is often more aggressive\nAs treatment options for breast cancer have improved, the overall mortality rate among younger women with the disease declined from 2010 to 2020, according to research presented in April at the American Association for Cancer Research meeting in Chicago.\nBut young women are still more likely to be diagnosed with aggressive breast cancer compared with older women. One reason could be that they\u2019re not getting screened as much, so it\u2019s harder to catch cases early. Young women are also more likely to be diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer, which tends to spread fast and has fewer treatment options.\nDr. Virginia Borges, a professor of medical oncology at the University of Colorado Cancer Center, said all women diagnosed with breast cancer before age 35 have a higher likelihood of the cancer spreading to the rest of their bodies, for reasons doctors don\u2019t fully understand.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like this great big puzzle of all these different factors that can contribute to why we see these cancers behave the way they do,\u201d Borges said.\nBansal said doctors are hoping to learn more about which treatments are better suited to women under 50.\n\u201cWe need more data to better tailor our treatments towards younger women,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of the studies that are done are in older women.\u201d\nLifestyle, environment, hormones\nThere are several mysteries as to why younger women are diagnosed with breast cancer at higher rates. Doctors generally agree that multiple factors are at play, including lifestyle, hormones and environmental exposures.\nDiets high in ultra-processed foods or a lack of physical activity can lead to obesity, which in turn elevates one\u2019s cancer risk. Women in their 30s and 40s have also increased their alcohol consumption in recent decades, and drinking alcohol is linked to breast cancer.\nExposure to environmental toxins such as air pollution, forever chemicals or microplastics could also play a role.\n\u201cBy the time women now in their 40s were babies, every single baby bottle had BPA. Everyone had Teflon pans in their home. Everyone was spraying Scotchgard around their home,\u201d said Suzanne Price, CEO of Breast Cancer Prevention Partners, a nonprofit that works to eliminate exposure to toxic chemicals.\nSeveral researchers said more data is needed to definitively draw that link.\n\u201cHopefully within the next few years, we should be having more insight into how those early life exposures drive the risk of breast cancer,\u201d said Dr. Adetunji Toriola, a professor of surgery at Washington University School of Medicine.\nSome studies have suggested that chemical hair straighteners, which are predominantly used by Black women, may be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Fayanju said the straighteners \u201ccan potentially have effects on our ability to process hormones in our body and how those hormones then interact with cells in our breasts, which have receptors for those hormones.\u201d\nChanges in women\u2019s reproductive lives might have some effect as well.\nGirls in the U.S. are starting their periods slightly earlier in life compared with decades ago. That may increase how long they\u2019re exposed to higher levels of estrogen \u2014 a hormone that in some cases can feed cancer cells. A study last year found an increase in the number of women ages 20 to 49 diagnosed with breast cancer that was responsive to estrogen.\nMany women are also delaying childbirth until their 30s and 40s, which increases the risk of postpartum breast cancer \u2014 cancers that occur within five to 10 years of giving birth that appear to be linked to changes in the breasts during that time. Borges estimated that there are 18,000 new cases of postpartum breast cancer each year.\n\u201cHow do you get from the millions of women who are having children without ending up with one of these breast cancers to the 18,000 or so who are going to get one of these breast cancers?\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re still working on figuring that out. Age is important.\u201d"]}]

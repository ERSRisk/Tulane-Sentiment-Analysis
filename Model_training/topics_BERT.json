        "U.S. high school students continue to lose ground in math and reading, as yearslong decline persists. Annie Ma, Associated Press\nAnnie Ma, Associated Press\nLeave your feedback\nWASHINGTON (AP) — A decade-long slide in high schoolers’ reading and math performance persisted during the COVID-19 pandemic, with 12th graders’ scores dropping to their lowest level in more than 20 years, according to results released Tuesday from an exam known as the nation’s report card.\nEighth-grade students also lost significant ground in science skills, according to the results from the National Assessment of Education Progress.\nREAD MORE: Judge strikes down Education Department guidance against school diversity programs\nThe assessments were the first since the pandemic for eighth graders in science and 12th graders in reading and math. They reflect a downward drift across grade levels and subject areas in previous releases from NAEP, which is considered one of the best gauges of the academic progress of U.S. schools.\n“Scores for our lowest-performing students are at historic lows,” said Matthew Soldner, the acting commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics. “These results should galvanize all of us to take concerted and focused action to accelerate student learning.”\nWhile the pandemic had an outsize impact on student achievement, experts said falling scores are part of a longer arc in education that cannot be attributed solely to COVID-19, school closures and related issues such as heightened absenteeism. Educators said potential underlying factors include children’s increased screen time, shortened attention spans and a decline in reading longer-form writing both in and out of school.\nThe dip in reading scores appeared alongside a shift in how English and language arts are taught in schools, with an emphasis on short texts and book excerpts, said Carol Jago, associate director of the California Reading and Literature Project at UCLA. As a high school English teacher 20 years ago, Jago said it was common for her high school students to read 20 books over the course of a year. Now, some English classes are assigning just three books a year.\n“To be a good reader, you have to have the stamina to stay on the page, even when the going gets tough,” Jago said. “You have to build those muscles, and we’re not building those muscles in kids.”\nEducation Secretary Linda McMahon said the scores show why the Trump administration wants to give states more control of education spending.\nREAD MORE: Trump looks to expand school choice programs by repurposing federal funding\n“Despite spending billions annually on numerous K-12 programs, the achievement gap is widening, and more high school seniors are performing below the basic benchmark in math and reading than ever before,” McMahon said.\nHouse Democrats said the Trump administration’s efforts to dismantle the Education Department will only hurt students. The declines show a need for federal investment in academic recovery and educational equity, said Democratic Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia, ranking member of the House Committee on Education and Workforce.\n“Eliminating the very agency responsible for supporting public schools and enforcing civil rights protections of students will only deepen the achievement gaps identified by this assessment,” Scott said.\nThe test scores show more students are not reaching what would be considered “basic” achievement across subject areas, said Lesley Muldoon, executive director of the National Assessment Governing Board. While NAEP’s definition of “proficient” is a high bar, Muldoon said, it is not an unreasonable one, and it is based on what researchers believe students should be able to achieve by the end of high school.\n“These students are taking their next steps in life with fewer skills and less knowledge in core academics than their predecessors a decade ago,” she said. “This is happening at a time when rapid advancements in technology and society demands more of future workers and citizens, not less.”\nIn reading, the average score in 2024 was the lowest score in the history of the assessment, which began in 1992. Thirty-two percent of high school seniors scored below “basic,” meaning they were not able to find details in a text to help them understand its meaning.\nIn math, the average score in 2024 was the lowest since 2005, when the assessment framework changed significantly. On the test, 45% of high school seniors scored below “basic” achievement, the highest percentage since 2005. Only 33% of high school seniors were considered academically prepared for college-level math courses, a decline from 37% in 2019.\nThe high school reading and math assessments, and the eighth grade science test, are given less frequently than the biannual fourth and eighth grade reading tests, which were last released earlier this year. The new scores reflect tests taken in schools around the country between January and March 2024.\nThe gap between the highest- and lowest-performing students was its widest ever among eighth grade science students, reflecting growing inequality in the American school system. The achievement gap widened also in 12th grade math.\nREAD MORE: St. Louis NAACP files civil rights complaint over low literacy rates among Black students\nThe scores also reflect the re-emergence of a gender gap in science, technology, engineering and math courses. In 2019, boys and girls scored virtually the same on the NAEP science assessment. But in 2024, girls saw a steeper decline in scores. A similar pattern occurred in state math assessments, according to an Associated Press analysis.\nSchools had largely closed the gender gap in math and science, but it widened in the years following the pandemic as special programs to engage girls lapsed.\nOn a NAEP survey of students, a shrinking percentage of eighth grade students said they regularly took part in inquiry-based learning activities in the classroom. The pandemic disrupted schools’ ability to create those hands-on learning experiences for students, which are often critical to understanding scientific concepts and processes, said Christine Cunningham, senior vice president of STEM learning at the Museum of Science in Boston.\nStill, she noted declines across subjects began well before schools closed in 2020.\n“We don’t know exactly what the cause of it is, but it would be incomplete to assume that if we hadn’t had COVID, the score would not have gone down,” Cunningham said. “That’s not what the data showed even before the pandemic.”\nFeathers reported from New York.

        "Why the secrecy over consultants' role in school plans?. Education writer James McEnaney details the latest developments in The Herald's investigation of controversial plans for a new school on one of Scotland's largest islands.\nSince early 2025, The Herald has led national coverage of the complex, and continuing, saga over a new school for the Isle of Mull.\nOfficials want to replace the dated Tobermory High School – which includes an integrated nursery and primary school – with modern facilities. Current plans would see the all-through school replicated at a new location on the edge of the town.\nBut campaigners and community leaders have consistently called for a different approach. Rather than a single location, they want to see the secondary school split and built on a standalone site in a more central location. This would allow all young people on Mull to attend high school while living at home – at present, children as young as eleven from the south of the island are sent to board in Oban during the week.\nSurveys of people living on Mull have found that a split site is the preferred choice, and a local family has offered free land for a secondary school in Craignure, a few minutes’ walk from the island’s ferry terminal.\nThe council says that such an approach is unaffordable and undeliverable, although a full cost analysis of the split-site approach has never been released. Its handling of the overall processes around the school has also been heavily criticised by islanders and described as an illustration of “what happens when decisions are made too far away from the people affected.”\nIn October, the matter will be heard at the Court of Session in Edinburgh after a successful appeal for a judicial review of the council’s decision making. If successful, officials are likely to have to restart the process, which the council argues may put the entire project at risk.\nWho else is involved?\nBehind the scenes of the bid for a new school on Mull, a crucial role has been played by an organisation called Hub North, a consultancy organisation which “provides communities with project management services for the building of community projects in North Scotland.”\nHub North was involved in the initial bidding phase of the project, which was combined with submissions from four other local authorities under the title of the North Schools Programme.\nThe consultancy firm has remained involved in subsequent stages of the process. For example, a proposal document from August 2024 shows that a fee of £90,595 (not including VAT or “expenses”) was to be charged for work around community engagement and site selection.\nIn an attempt to understand the full nature of Hub North’s role, particularly with regards to consultation with the people of Mull and the way in which the site selection process was handled, The Herald asked Argyll and Bute Council to release copies of all communication between the two organisations since January 2024. The request was submitted on 14 July 2025.\nOfficials responded on 11 August 2025 advising that the request for information was being rejected in its entirety.\nThe council claimed that the request was “manifestly unreasonable” because it would impose a “significant burden” on the authority. Specifically, officials argue that it would take nearly 200 hours to process the emails held in their systems, of which there are more than 5,500. The cost of processing this is cited at more than £2500.\nEven without this pressure, however, they state that the request would, “in the opinion of a reasonable person, be considered manifestly unreasonable or disproportionate.”\nOfficials go on to accept that there would still be \"a public interest in being transparent and open\" and that the release of the requested information would \"would allow public scrutiny of the decisions it has taken in regard to the new school on Mull.\"\nHowever, they nevertheless find that the public interest in withholding the information outweighs the benefits of its release.\nREAD MORE\nMull campus 'paused' pending outcome of legal case\n-\nCouncil facing court date after Mull campaigners raise £50k\n-\nCouncil chiefs snub MSP-led discussion over school plans\n-\nRather than handling the request under Freedom of Information (FOI) legislation, the council has dealt with it under the rules governing Environmental Information Regulations (EIR) which allow for requests to be dismissed as “manifestly unreasonable”.\nAdvice from the Scottish Information Commissioner states that public bodies “should not use this exception lightly” and that it is designed to deal with the “rare occasions” when individuals do not “exercise their rights to information responsibly.”\nIn subsequent communications, Argyll and Bute Council Executive Director Douglas Hendry stated that the request was treated as an EIR because it “related to the provision of a new school facility on Mull.” However, a significant number of requests for information on the same topic, including some submitted on the same day, have been dealt with under FOI rules.\nIn response to one of these requests, following an initial attempted refusal, the council has provided a small selection of documents regarding the successful application for a Judicial Review of the council’s decision to locate the new Mull school in Tobermory. This disclosure includes communication from Hub North which had been withheld.\nWhat does the email say?\nAt 20:24 on 8 June 2025, Hub North’s Communication and Marketing Manager, Bob Dow, sent an email with the subject line ‘Tobermory Campus’. There were four recipients: the Chief Executive, Operations Director, and a Project Director at Hub North, as well as the Mull Campus Team Project Manager, who has an Argyll & Bute Council email address.\nThe message requests that the council worker, as well as one of the Hub North staff members, analyse a recently published crowd-funder that had been opened by community leaders seeking support for the Judicial Review. The appeal ultimately raised tens of thousands of pounds in just a few days.\nMr Dow asks that the page is checked “line by line” and that a list of “any inaccuracies, misinformation, and misrepresentation” are submitted to him. This, he adds, will allow him to “draft a social media response” in the council’s name to “rebut” any information deemed “incorrect.”\nThe individuals are also asked to “follow the same process” with respect to an article published by the Herald on 6 June 2025, which reported on council chiefs refusing to participate in an MSP-led discussion about the plans for a school on Mull.\nMr Dow states that he plans to “draft a letter of complaint” that will be issued in the name of the council, not Hub North. This, he adds, is in relation to the use of the term “community leaders”, which he says is false because the individuals in question “are a self-appointed protest group.”\nThe Herald understands four of the five members of group were part of a Mull Community Sounding Board established by the council. Two were community councillors, one represented a parent council, and one represented an island community trust\nThe council’s own website says that the Community Sounding Board was “formed of community representatives who are impacted by or have an interest in the proposed new Mull 2-18 Campus.”\nThe email concludes with Mr Dow stating that he has already spoken to the Argyll and Bute Council communication team about “taking a more robust stance” and that this “starts from here.”\nREAD MORE\n'Silenced and belittled' - islanders hit out over new school plans\n-\nAbandoned: students fears over island education let down\n-\nAnalysis: Council backed the status quo instead of the people of Mull\n-\nWhat do the council and the consultants say?\nThe council has already confirmed the contents of Mr Dow’s email on 8 June, but insists that no social media posts or press complaints were drafted. Regarding his ability to direct the actions of a member of staff working for the council, a spokesperson advised that they are in fact an employee of Hub North currently seconded to the council, and rejected suggestions of any improper behaviour.\nThe Herald has asked Argyll and Bute Council to explain why it is \"manifestly unreasonable\" for it to release communications with Hub North regarding the Mull school project, and why the request was treated in a different way to others on the same topic.\nTheir spokesperson responded that the council has already \"explained why this request, which identified potentially 5518 emails, was 'manifestly unreasonable', the language used in the relevant regulations, due to the significant burden on the Council the request would have.\"\nThey added: \"With regard to FOI and EIR requests. The request was dealt with in terms of the Environmental Information Regulations. When you raised this, we confirmed the reasons for this. We also advised that had it been addressed in terms of the Freedom of Information Legislation, then it would have exceeded the costs set out in the fees regulations.

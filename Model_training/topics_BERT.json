        "Meet the strangest members of Trump’s inner circle. The strangest members of Trump’s inner circle have more power than they’ve ever had before\nThey have deep connections with secret societies. His brother is in DOGE. And they may or may not be personal friends of Elon Musk. Holly Baxter spends the day with Simone and Malcolm Collins, who believe they can culturally reprogram America — and whose vision seems to be coming true\nIn rural Pennsylvania, I’m hiking through the forest with Simone and Malcom Collins and discussing the executive order they wrote for Donald Trump. Just outside their house — beyond the chicken coop, where they gather their eggs for homemade cakes, and the fenced-in part of the yard where their Corgi, The Professor, plays — is a forest, a small river, and some easy hiking trails. It’s a beautiful day in late spring, and among the greenery and the birdsong, we feel very far from Washington. Yet Simone and Malcolm are surprisingly influential in the Trump administration. I’m here to work out exactly how that happened.\nAs we walk and talk, the day heats up. Malcolm points out a disused mine shaft on the property, and takes us further along to show us the abandoned remnants of railroad leading up to it. Simone suggests we head back to their stone cottage for some homemade lemonade. She’s pregnant with their fifth child; her fourth, one-year-old Industry Americus, is strapped to her back in a carrier. She’s struggling with the walk, but Malcolm insists we carry on a little longer. He likes to show off the scenery.\nIt turns out that the executive order — the controversial “give out motherhood medals to women who’ve had six or more kids” one that caused such a stir recently — was actually written by Simone alone, with some help from AI. Malcolm manages their five-day-a-week podcast schedule, she explains, while she’s responsible for most of their written output. It makes sense to me that Simone would have been the decider on the medals, I say. After all, she’s the one who carries the children. It seems like she’d be the most opinionated on which number of offspring counts as medal-worthy. And of course, she wouldn’t have chosen five, since she’s already achieved that.\nShe laughs. “It’s true,” she says, “that would’ve been awfully convenient for me.” Six, she supposes, is a personal “stretch goal,” so that probably did factor in. But of course, her real stretch goal is fourteen.\nThe Collinses are part of a small but growing movement known as “pronatalism” — the belief that society should actively encourage childbirth, often through incentives or cultural pressure, to stave off civilizational collapse. But they aren’t religious, and they don’t agree with forcing people to have children through rolling back reproductive rights or outright bribes. Instead, they are former Silicon Valley-based tech founders, who use polygenic analysis on their IVF embryos in an effort to select for advantageous traits. There’s some debate about whether the couple — with their bold, thick-rimmed glasses and their penchant for an edgy take — are fringe weirdos or credible commentators. One thing’s for sure: once you scratch the surface of their political connections, it’s clear they have a whole lot of influence for supposed fringe weirdos.\nSo how exactly does a pronatalist couple living in the countryside get their work on Donald Trump’s desk? The Collinses don’t like to talk specifics, but a little digging reveals that they have multiple points of connection with the current administration. For one thing, Malcolm’s brother Miles is in DOGE, the Elon Musk-founded “Department for Government Efficiency” which isn’t really a department. It is, instead, a group of people handpicked by Musk (who recently left the administration, publicly insulted Trump, then walked it all back) who work inside each sector of government, functioning as overseers. Miles and his wife, Brittany, are pronatalists themselves, though they’re much more private about it than Simone and Malcolm: they’ve never even publicly confirmed how many children they have. They’re also entrepreneurs, just like Malcolm and Simone, and they recently co-owned a series of fertility clinics.\nIt’s a common thread among DOGE staffers, who clearly have more in common than simply a passion for businesslike efficiency. Musk has to be the most famous pronatalist on earth at this point, having publicly stated for a number of years that he believes he has a moral imperative to procreate as much as possible. And weeks after the birth of his first child, White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary and DOGE spokesperson Harrison Fields wrote a Mothers’ Day tribute to his wife that read: “Let’s keep building this Fields Family — the more babies who call you Mom, the better.”\nThen there’s JD Vance, whose “childless cat ladies” remark was once considered a faux pas and now looks a lot more like a dog-whistle. The father-of-three has been talking about how he wants “more babies in America” for years. And his brief stint in Silicon Valley — once a bastion of liberal values, now increasingly leaning right — as a venture capitalist made him some friends in very high places. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Google CEO Sundar Pichai were all at Trump’s second inauguration in January.\nThere’s an increasing sense among many that the age of straight-up, populist MAGA is ending. Out of the ashes of the final Trump term, some hope, will emerge a tech-adjacent, anti-woke New Right that is ready to lead America, pioneered by JD Vance and financed by the likes of Thiel and Musk. That may explain the fallout between Musk and Trump not long after Musk departed the White House a few weeks ago. It may also explain why Vance’s reaction to the fallout was noticeably muted.\nThe black sheep of the family\nOn a tour round the Collins house, Simone points out all the different places where 14 children might be able to sleep if she’s able to bear that many. At the moment, she sleeps in a four-poster bed made of dark wood, carefully made up with expensive linens. There’s a crib in the corner, though she usually co-sleeps with Industry. The other three kids — Octavian George (a boy), Torsten Savage (a boy), and Titan Invictus (a girl) — sleep in a triple bunk-bed downstairs. In a closet under the stairs, there’s a twin bed jammed into the space with three sets of ear defenders suspended above. That’s where they put Octavian sometimes, Malcolm says, because he has meltdowns.\nThe decor is mainly in keeping with the old house — painted portraits, a lemon-motif tablecloth — with scattered pieces of aggressive Americana (large flags, a mounted AR-15.) Every room is spotless, except Malcolm’s bedroom, which he quickly closes the door on after we’ve taken a perfunctory peek. Inside, expensive video and audio equipment for the podcast is shoved into a corner, empty cans and food wrappers litter the surfaces and some of the floor, and a gigantic screen looms over the unmade bed.\nMalcolm explains that he’s always been the “black sheep of the family.” He was once suspended from school and sent to a Holes-style juvenile correctional facility for threatening students. What actually happened, he says, is “I was building explosives in my backyard, building switchblade type things,” in the way of lots of young boys in rural Texas. Word got around, and he ended up in the principal’s office, where he was told: “We're really concerned about the thing that you're making, because you could use it to like, kill other students or something.” Malcolm laughs: “I was just like, aghast. I got really angry. I was like: You’re insulting me! That would be such an inefficient way to kill students! If I was gonna kill other students, I'd do it like X and Y and Z.”\nSuch literal-mindedness didn’t go down well with the school, and the school’s reaction didn’t go down well with Malcolm’s parents. They sent him away to what Simone calls “prison camp” and then, after that, to boarding school — he never returned to the family home after the age of 13. After weeks at the correctional facility, he ended up hospitalized with malnourishment and weighing — at over six feet tall — just 90 pounds. “People tried to kill him at that prison camp,” Simone says.\nIt sounds like a harsh upbringing and a traumatic experience. Does Malcolm harbor any resentment toward his family for exposing him to things like that? “No,” he says quickly. After all, he turned out fine in the end. The “urban monoculture” will “try to turn people against their natural support network, which is their birth culture and their family, and try to convince them: hey, you should go to a therapist and what did your parents do to you? What's this trauma you have with your parents?” he says. “I think that there are going to always be malevolent forces that benefit from getting us to blame our parents for things. And I do not think that is good for me to model that to my kids. For example, if I go around talking about, oh, my parents this, my parents that, why would they not adopt the same thing as me? I think it's on all of us to understand that parents generally try to do what's best for their kids. And the more that we are tricked into believing anything else, the easier it is for us to be led culturally astray.”\nWhat counts as Malcolm’s “birth culture” is a little complicated. Simone takes an ornamental mug out of the kitchen cabinet and shows it to me: it belonged to Malcolm’s grandfather when he was in Congress. As I turn over the mug in my hands, Malcolm talks about how he comes from “the greater Appalachian cultural tradition,” where “as a young kid, you do blow things up — you're supposed to blow up army men, you do build explosives, you do make flamethrowers. That's a sign that you are, within this culture, innovative and vitalistic.” It’s a culture of truck nuts and mud-wrestling, he adds, and it’s very egalitarian: the champion female mud-wrestlers, for instance, are afforded a lot of respect in the community.\nDespite his efforts to tell a quintessentially Appalachian backstory, it’s clear that Malcolm — who grew up in Texas — is less JD Vance and more RFK Jr. There’s a Collins Rotunda at Harvard, a physical testament to the amount of money Malcolm’s family has donated over the years. His uncle was the former president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank in Dallas. In fact, pretty much every relative has been to an elite Ivy League institution and runs a successful startup or works in government. Family gatherings are both intellectually stimulating and brutally dog-eat-dog. When he got into Stanford Business School, Malcolm says, he rang his dad in a moment of great excitement and pride to tell him, and his father drily responded: “Their standards must really have dropped.”\nSecret societies and off-the-record retreats\nYou won’t just find members of the Collins family dominating the upper echelons of public and private sector roles; you’ll also find them, if you’re privileged enough, in the underworld of American secret societies. It’s a world that holds a special interest for Malcolm and Simone both.\nSimone was once the managing director of Dialog, a secret society co-run by the billionaire PayPal and Palantir founder Peter Thiel. It’s an experience she calls “eye-opening”. It happened in 2020, when she and Malcolm were both looking for jobs “but he, being a white man, wasn’t going to get one in 2020 for sure,” she says. “Even people who talked with him candidly were like: We really can't hire someone of your profile right now.” Simone, however, was a little more lucky: she got a callback after applying for an interesting-sounding role through a platform called Scouted.\nDialog recruits desirable candidates — based very much on how much money and influence they have — and invites them to off-the-record retreats to discuss the future of America.\n“Even among secret societies or even just invite-only societies and ideas festivals, [Dialog] is definitely the most snobby and exclusive,” Simone says, smiling. “I codified their qualifying criteria — and I know now that they're even more rigorous about it.”\nThe organization had two levels: “Junior Dialog” and then Dialog proper, “and at that time — so I'm sure it's more expensive now to attend — Junior Dialog was maybe $6,000 or something” for a three-day retreat, while “adult Dialog was like $15,000,” she says. The Dialog retreats are held in isolated places like the middle of the Utah desert, and they’re “extremely high-touch,” meaning that everyone is expected to participate in debate and conversation — “as in, you get kicked out if you don’t participate.” Every conversation has a chosen moderator, sometimes a Dialog staff member and sometimes a participant, and that moderator will “rate every single participant.” At the end, the ratings are tallied up, and the people with the lowest ratings are kicked out immediately. “They will even kick people out in the middle of the event,” Simone adds. “And these are people who have paid $15,000 to be here.”\nIn Simone’s opinion, the criteria can be a little harsh. In Malcolm’s, however, they’re completely reasonable. “The main reason you would get kicked out is if [you were trying] to shut down controversial conversations by being like: You can’t talk like this, this is offensive and I’m gonna shame you,” he says, adding that that’s something the urban monoculture does all the time in the wider world. He thinks it’s fair enough to excommunicate someone for behaving that way, “because people were preventing open and honest conversation.”\nHow does one get noticed by the Dialog staff, and therefore invited to their secret retreats, in the first place? There are “various criteria” that might get you an invitation, says Simone, along the lines of: “Has your startup raised over $50 million? Do you have 500,000 followers on social media plus a huge media impact, or are you a famous international advocate? How many news stories are out about you?” You have to hit a number of these to be able to come along, adds Simone, and even she and Malcolm don’t qualify for Dialog anymore. “So it’s very elite,” Malcolm clarifies.\nHe would know. The Collins family has long had connections in secret societies, if the rumors are to be believed. The Bohemian Club, an all-male secret society that operates the annual retreat Bohemian Grove and whose members have included a number of US presidents, made the news a year ago when it was reported that Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas had attended with a billionaire friend. Malcolm’s godfather was supposedly also a high-ranking member.\nThese days, however, retreats like Bohemian Grove — often referred to as a “summer camp” for the super rich and powerful — are being eclipsed by edgier, weirder alternatives. Hereticon is the most famous, with its own clandestine annual conference — “The Apocalypse Ball” — that wannabe attendees can apply to via Google Doc. Questions on the application include: “What apocalypse are you currently focused on (realizing or preventing)?”\nMalcolm says that Hereticon is “the best secret society in the world right now.” Past attendees have said that the annual Apocalypse Ball includes activities like getting tattooed on the spot, taking home your own genetically engineered frog embryo (you get to insert a genetic quirk, such as bioluminescence or albinism or a gene to make the frog grow extremely large, with the help of an on-hand scientist), and attending off-the-record salons with speakers who have been “cancelled” or are “ideological outcasts” in mainstream society. Where Bohemian Grove was a nostalgic summer camp with suits, Hereticon is a technicolor playground for rich and powerful people who insist on their supposed underdog status. Backed by Peter Thiel’s venture capital firm, Founders’ Fund, it hosts discussions on issues like how to achieve immortality, “transhumanism” (i.e. enhancing the human body with robotics and other tech), and UFOs. In 2022, Grimes — the musician and mother of three of Elon Musk’s children — posted a selfie from Hereticon, where she appears to have done a surprise DJ set that year, as well as in early 2024.\nWas the richest man in the world himself in attendance? It seems likely, but Simone and Malcolm are cagey about anything relating to Musk. In the large, low-ceilinged kitchen of their stone house, Simone looks up a recipe for lemon cake and then starts to make it, pouring from an industrial-sized bag of flour and using eggs from the coop outside. Industry dozes on Simone’s back, clutching a toy scavenged during our slow drift from room to room earlier. A little “Trump 2025” flag is placed conspicuously in a vase on top of the refrigerator, and Malcolm is bouncing a child’s playground ball off the hard floor again and again as he describes how he sees himself as a superhero fighting Thanos when he stands up to the urban monoculture.\nThey vacillate between domestic asides and political commentary: Simone brings out a black-and-white picture of the owners of the house from the 1800s; Malcolm talks about how transgender people have unfairly taken over the LGBT conversation and put off the “normal gays”; Simone describes how she was brainwashed by liberal thinking after her upbringing in California, and how Malcolm helped her see that during an impassioned conversation on their first date; Malcolm glances out the window and points out some DIY that he needs to attend to outside. Simone is wearing a white bonnet that Malcolm encouraged her to put on after we arrived, because they like to wind people up with exaggerated tradwife-style costumes. Malcolm is dressed in a polo shirt and jeans.\nSimone offers round seltzer waters; Malcolm brings out a six-pack of Coors Light for himself and starts on the first. What’s bothering me, I say, is that, despite their various connections in high places, I still don’t entirely understand how they got that draft executive order in front of Trump. Malcolm is clear that he and his brother do not have “career conversations”. He mentions that The New York Times criticized their motherhood medal idea and, in doing so, amplified it. But a newspaper can only do so much, I say. What about Elon Musk? He’s an extremely prominent pronatalist. At the time of the executive order, he was spending every day at the White House. Do you ever have conversations with him?\nThe mood in the room dramatically shifts. Malcolm trains his eyes on the floor. “He has never funded our organization,” he says, eventually, “and a lot of people believe he has. That's what I can say about that.”\nI push a little harder. I’m not asking about money towards pronatalist causes, I say, but just pronatalism in general, as a political aim without finances involved. Have they ever sat down and had a chat with Elon Musk about that?\nSilence again. “What I can say is that he hasn’t funded us,” Malcolm repeats, eyes still on the ground.\nI turn to look at Simone, who’s now sitting in the corner with Industry on her lap. “I think I hear what you’re saying,” I say, and she catches my eye and smiles. It’s not a denial, but it is plausible deniability.\nChanging society through AI\nSimone and Malcolm own another small house on their property, where their neighbors live rent-free so long as they can provide day-to-day childcare. But even with such nearby help, parenting is still hard. Both Octavian and Torsten are autistic. They each have very firm food preferences and eat restricted diets, and they get overstimulated easily. A lot of the time, every person in the house eats a different meal, in different rooms to each other.\nThe Collinses have friends in the pronatalist movement, people with similarly large families with whom they can trade tips and tricks. Once, Malcolm says, he asked one of those families how they approach a situation where a child really seems to be struggling, such as refusing to eat anything except white rice due to sensory issues. What do you do to tamp down the anxiety? Their response, he says, was refreshing: “Just have more kids!” It reminded him that such modern stressors would never have bothered their ancestors, and that a lot of the time, children work things out on their own.\nThe pronatalist movement is “very diverse,” Simone says, as we discuss further the families that they know. There are Catholics, tradwife types, tech-forward New Right devotees like the Collinses themselves. It does sound diverse, I say, in some ways. But where are the progressive pronatalists? Do they know any?\nThey stop talking for a moment and Simone says, “Hmm.” Eventually, they concede they don’t know any, but that there probably are some out there. Maybe they’re too shy to declare themselves because of the liberal order. Perhaps they’ve been blinded by the urban monoculture and feel like they should have fewer children than they really want.\nBack from an afternoon with the neighbors, Titan and Torsten come running up the garden path and into the house. Malcolm redirects them into the fenced-off yard, where Titan — a ball of energy with her hair in pigtails — pokes at the chickens in the coop and Torsten — more quiet and reticent — stops to examine my photographer’s camera. Industry is still on Simone’s back, occasionally dozing and babbling to herself; Octavian is at kindergarten, and will come home later on the school bus. As the family gathers together for a photo, Malcolm chases Torsten across the grass and throws him over his shoulder. They’re all wearing yellow shoes, Malcolm and Simone included. Malcolm explains that it’s a family policy, as it’s an easy way to identify each other from afar.\nAlthough Octavian goes to kindergarten at the local public school, Malcolm says, they plan to educate the kids primarily via AI — hopefully through their own educational startup, The Collins Institute, if they can secure funding. With potentially fourteen children in the home, Octavian, Torsten, Titan, Industry, soon-to-be-born baby Tex and their siblings will have very different opportunities to Malcolm, who grew up with just one brother, and Simone, who was an only child.\nThat’s true, says Malcolm, but his family gave him “no inheritance” anyway — the only thing they did was pay for college. Can Malcolm and Simone afford to do the same and pay their kids through college? No, but college isn’t worth it any more, they say. It’s just a breeding ground for liberal indoctrination. AI will replace it, and that can’t happen soon enough.\nThe Collinses are confident that AI is going to rapidly change society — politically, academically, and socially — and that the New Right will be at the forefront of that change. Recent developments suggest that they’re correct, and that the current administration is particularly invested. In mid-June, executives from OpenAI, Palantir and Meta were sworn in as Army Reserve officers after the Department of Defense awarded them each multimillion-dollar contracts to build a solid AI component for future “warfighting”. And Trump’s so-called Big, Beautiful Bill includes one extremely unusual element: an effective ban on states implementing any AI regulations for at least 10 years.\nMalcolm believes that as his kids grow up, they will remain ideologically aligned with him. AI education will help with that; they won’t be indoctrinated by teachers into the urban monoculture, and they’ll be able to explore their own personal interests through the help of a personalized AI tutor. With four kids under the age of five and another on the way, the Collinses have no problem with family rows over politics at the moment. But I wonder what a house full of teenagers as headstrong as Malcolm and Simone will look like in the future.\nIt’s getting late in the afternoon. As we exit the house and start saying our goodbyes, Titan follows us down the path, shrieking and getting under Malcolm’s feet. She is a rambunctious, happy little girl who bears a striking resemblance to her father. Simone, keeping an eye on Torsten and still hauling Industry, hangs back at the house.\n“Do you wish you weren’t born?” Malcolm asks Titan repeatedly, as they stand at the gate and watch us walk towards our car. “Are you glad you’re alive?”\nTitan just looks back at him in confusion and laughs. She is, after all, only three years old.\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments",
        "Tucker Carlson leads MAGA's worried warriors in questioning Trump. As President Donald Trump weighed U.S. involvement in the conflict between Israel and Iran last month, some influential members of his online MAGA army began to question what he was doing.\nBut few were prominent enough to face a direct response from the president.\n“Somebody please explain to kooky Tucker Carlson that, ‘IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON!’” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.\n“I don’t know what Tucker Carlson is saying,” Trump said in response to a reporter’s question at the Group of Seven summit the same day. “Let him go get a television network and say it so that people listen.”\nIn the course of a few weeks, Trump has faced a surprising level of pushback from prominent supporters as he moved to strike nuclear facilities in Iran, floated a new policy to allow undocumented farmworkers to remain in the United States and castigated allies for demanding more information related to the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Even in that environment, Carlson, regarded as a MAGA standard-bearer, stood out.\n“I like Trump. I campaigned for Trump,” Carlson said in an interview, adding: “But I’ve got my views. I assume that we will overlap on most things, and I hope that, by the way, the bombing of the nuclear sites in Iran, which I did not support, I hope it works out great, and I’ll be grateful if it does. And I’ll be the first to say I was wrong for the millionth time in my life.”\nIn June, Carlson said Trump was “complicit in the act of war” as Israel launched attacks on Iran. (Trump later said Carlson “called and apologized.”) One month before, Carlson echoed concerns about Trump’s business dealings in the Middle East, saying “it seems like corruption” when Shawn Ryan, a guest on his program, raised alarm about new Trump properties in the region. And now, he is taking the administration to task for declining to release additional information about Epstein, with whom Trump had a yearslong friendship before a falling-out.\n“The fact that the U.S. government, the one that I voted for, refused to take my question seriously and instead said, ‘Case closed, shut up conspiracy theorist,’ was too much for me,” Carlson said Friday at the Turning Point USA Student Action Summit, where he devoted his speech to the issue. “And I don’t think the rest of us should be satisfied with that.”\nCarlson emphasized his personal admiration for Trump but took issue with his response to the furor over the Epstein files. At a Cabinet meeting last week, Trump brushed off growing discontent and said it was “a desecration” to ask about Epstein after flooding in Texas killed dozens.\n“It’s not adequate to say anyone who asked [questions] is somehow desecrating the memory of little girls who died in Texas,” Carlson said in his speech Friday, adding: “I don’t care who gives that answer. That is not acceptable.”\nCarlson’s frustrations represent broader discontent in MAGA world with the policies of the man who brought it together. It’s a key moment for the movement, which for the past decade has been largely in lockstep, testing whether it’s willing to truly break with Trump and whether anyone besides Trump can shape its direction.\n‘I was never an important adviser to Trump’\nAsked about his direct discussions with Trump, Carlson said he “certainly had a lot of conversations with him,” though he declined to say when the two men last spoke.\n“I’m not a policymaker,” he said. “I’m just a guy with opinions. I don’t work there. I’ve never worked in any government. I’ve never taken any money from any politician or any government, and I just have strong views, which, by the way, are sometimes wrong, really wrong. I supported the Iraq War. So my track record is spotty.”\nAnd Carlson said he was unaware whether his influence in the White House has waned in light of his recent commentary.\n“I was never an important adviser to Trump,” he said. “It was always kind of overstated.”\nCarlson was center stage among MAGA influencers arguing for the United States to stay out of Iran, a position that has gained popularity on the right as some right-wing influencers have increasingly viewed the U.S.-Israel alliance with skepticism. That stance is also informed by Trump’s having promoted similar anti-war and anti-interventionist views for years, even as he has used military force as president. Ultimately, Carlson said, the most important voice arguing the case to Trump for the U.S. bombing of Iran’s nuclear facilities was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n“Turns out a head of state of an important ally has a more compelling message than I do,” he said. “That seems reasonable to me. I still disagree, but I don’t think it’s like Trump has changed his views entirely.”\nSome around Trump have taken a victory lap given that he ultimately didn’t ally with Carlson on military action in Iran.\n“The Iran operation was both a shot at the Iranians, but it was also a shot at the restrainers of the administration and at Tucker and everyone else who said the president is never going to do this,” a Trump ally close to the administration said. “They think he’s an ideologue like they are, and he isn’t. These guys overplayed their hands.”\nTrump’s relationship with Carlson has had peaks and valleys dating to his first administration. Most notably, during Dominion Voting Systems’ 2023 court battle against Fox News, the judge made public text messages showing Carlson’s trashing Trump amid his effort to overturn his 2020 loss, in which he privately said, “I hate him passionately.”\n“He’s never been a natural ally of the president,” a second Trump ally said, pointing to the texts.\nBut the two reconciled during Trump’s third run for the White House as both were in exile: Carlson having been ousted from Fox News as part of the fallout over the Dominion lawsuit and Trump facing multiple indictments, including in connection with his role in trying to reverse his 2020 defeat.\nWhen Carlson was forced out of his show in 2023, Trump said he was “shocked,” adding, “He’s a very good person and a very good man and very talented, as you know, and he had very high ratings.” The strengthening of their relationship led Carlson to campaign for Trump, including in a prime-time speaking slot at last summer’s Republican convention.\nGiven Carlson’s stature in the MAGA movement, prominent Trump allies have come to his defense. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said last month that Carlson “is one of my favorite people.” Arguing against intervention in Iran, she added, was “not kooky.”\nSteve Bannon, the former White House aide and MAGA media personality, who occupies a perch similar to Carlson’s, said the brouhaha between the two men comes during “a time of turmoil” when Trump is handling a number of crises at once. He said Carlson is “still one of the leaders of our movement and an incredibly strong, independent voice.”\n“Tucker has always worked at this a little more with a jaundiced eye,” Bannon said. “He came to this movement late. He waited and measured it. He respects President Trump; he supported President Trump. When Tucker took on the ruling class, it was a seminal moment for MAGA — because he did it on Fox prime time. Since then, Tucker has been there for ‘America First,’ especially when it mattered most.”\nMore broadly, Bannon said, MAGA influencers and thought leaders have to call out policy decisions that veer from base expectations in hope of ensuring their perspective is represented.\n“You’ve got to represent every day and continue to make sure that people understand, particularly people around President Trump, and sometimes even the president himself, understands where we think core values lie,” Bannon said.\n‘A dissident figure’\nIt’s not as if Carlson hadn’t publicly criticized Trump or his administration before. He similarly sounded the alarm in 2020 when the United States killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, and he criticized Trump’s handling of national protests after Minneapolis police murdered George Floyd later that year. While such pushback isn’t new, a person close to Carlson said he has never crossed the line into all-consuming criticism such as Matt Drudge or Ann Coulter, other conservative media personalities who have sharply broken with Trump.\n“Tucker’s not being malicious towards the president at all,” a source close to the White House said. “You can very easily still support somebody and disagree with a specific policy decision. Agree with him or disagree with him, Tucker is at least coming from a sincere place of love and concern for the president. He just wants the president to be successful and is worried that issues like amnesty, Epstein, Ukraine funding and war in the Middle East could eventually lead to his presidency being derailed.”\nTrump maintains high approval ratings with the Republican base, which is informing how he and the White House view the pushback online. An Economist/YouGov survey published Tuesday found that 87% of Republicans approve of Trump’s handling of his job so far.\n“The president cares deeply about the MAGA base; he is very responsive to them,” a person familiar with the White House’s thinking said.\nThis person pointed to online chatter last week about whether Trump would offer some sort of “amnesty” after he talked up an effort at a rally to allow undocumented farmworkers to stay in the country, noting that at a Cabinet meeting, Trump was responsive to the concerns and said there would be “no amnesty.”\n“Things like that are notable when thinking about how the president balances the viewpoints he’s getting,” the person added. “And a lot of what he’s done recently are direct responses to so many of the campaign promises made to the base.”\nA MAGA thought leader described Trump and Carlson as “two of the great minds of MAGA,” saying the movement wouldn’t exist in its current form without either one. This person worried the MAGA perspective was “getting a little squeezed out of the inner circle” at the White House on several issues of note.\n“People are not going to go along with endless war,” this person said. “And when they see the capitulation on Epstein, it just hurts. The Trump administration made overtures that they were serious about this. But six months in and kind of trying to tie a bow around it, it’s just not satisfying. That’s not going to sit well.”\nNo other issue has tested the MAGA base’s commitment to Trump like the Epstein files.\nFor years, many on the right — including some people who are now in the Trump administration — have called for the release of all government documents related to Epstein. Epstein died in custody in 2019, and a medical examiner ruled his death a suicide. He was facing sex trafficking and conspiracy charges.\nLast week, Attorney General Pam Bondi released a memo saying the Justice Department’s review turned up no “client list” of powerful men alleged to have participated in Epstein’s schemes, enraging the MAGA base, who are calling on her to be fired. Trump’s defense of Bondi and his attempts to tell his supporters to move on from the issue have done little to quell the furor.\nOn Saturday, Trump wrote “LET PAM BONDI DO HER JOB — SHE’S GREAT!” on Truth Social, adding the United States should “not waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein, somebody that nobody cares about.”\nIn his NBC News interview, Carlson said he now believes the Justice Department actually doesn’t have “much relevant information about Jeffrey Epstein’s sex crimes.”\n“Rather than just admit that, Pam Bondi made a bunch of ludicrous claims on cable news shows that she couldn’t back up, and this current outrage is the result,” he said.\nA Republican Senate aide thinks Carlson is actually having a bit of a “revival” as he carves out distinct space on the right.\n“He’s more of a dissident figure now,” this person said. “For whatever else you’re going to say, Tucker is just kind of saying what he thinks.”\nNo recent moment generated more buzz for Carlson than his contentious and combative interview with Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, which put the MAGA divide over the conflict between Israel and Iran on full display. Even with the administration not siding with him, Carlson said he’s “really grateful” that there’s significant debate on the right over a litany of policy issues.\nAs for his assessment of the first six months of Trump’s second presidency, he said, “I think they’re trying.”\n“The most important thing, not just for Republicans, not even for all the first-time Republican voters who supported Trump, but just for the country,” Carlson said, “is to make it clear that you’re trying to achieve what you said you would achieve.”",

Following his inauguration on January 20, 2025, Trump became only the second president to serve two nonconsecutive terms, the first being Grover Cleveland (1885–89; 1893–97). In January 2025, upon his sentencing without punishment for a felony conviction in 2024, Trump officially became the first convicted felon to be elected president. At age 78, Trump is the oldest person to win the office.\nTrump’s conviction took place on May 30, 2024, when a New York state jury found him guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with a hush-money payment in 2016 to the adult-film star Stephanie Clifford, known as Stormy Daniels, who claimed to have had an affair with Trump in 2006. He had also been indicted on dozens of other federal and state charges in cases relating to his efforts to overturn his defeat in the presidential election of 2020 and his removal of numerous classified documents from the White House upon leaving office. Following Trump’s election to a second term, special counsel Jack Smith, who led both federal criminal cases against Trump, requested that the election-related charges against Trump be dropped and that Trump be removed from the group of codefendants in the classified documents case. Smith’s decisions reflected a Justice Department policy that prohibits the criminal prosecution of a sitting president.\nTrump was also found liable in a major civil suit alleging business fraud in New York state and in two civil suits accusing him of sexually abusing and defaming the writer E. Jean Carroll.\nTrump is the third president in U.S. history (after Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998) to be impeached by the U.S. House of Representatives and the only president to be impeached twice—once (in 2019) for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress in connection with the Ukraine scandal and once (in 2021) for “incitement of insurrection” in connection with the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by a violent mob of Trump supporters. Both of Trump’s impeachments ended in his acquittal by the U.S. Senate.\nAfter the midterm elections of 2022, Trump declared his intention to run for a second term, and in primary elections in early 2024 he accumulated enough delegates to win his party’s nomination, despite the steady progress of the legal cases against him. Although some Republican Party leaders worried that a criminal trial could seriously weaken Trump’s appeal to moderate Republican and independent voters, others took the hopeful view that Trump would use his court appearances to solidify his support by casting himself as a political martyr—the victim of Democratic-led “witch hunts,” “hoaxes,” and “scams,” as he frequently characterized the many legal investigations he faced.\nTrump is also a real estate developer and businessman who has owned, managed, or licensed his name to hotels, casinos, golf courses, resorts, and residential properties in the New York City area and around the world. Since the 1980s Trump has lent his name to scores of retail ventures—including branded lines of clothing, cologne, food, and furniture. In the early 21st century his private conglomerate, the Trump Organization, comprised some 500 companies involved in a wide range of businesses, including hotels and resorts, residential properties, merchandise, and entertainment and television.\nEarly life and business career\nTrump was the fourth of five children of Frederick (Fred) Christ Trump, a successful real estate developer, and Mary MacLeod. Donald’s eldest sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, eventually served as a U.S. district court judge (1983–99) and later as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit until her retirement in 2011. His elder brother, Frederick, Jr. (Freddy), worked briefly for their father’s business before becoming an airline pilot in the 1960s. Freddy’s alcoholism led to his early death in 1981, at the age of 43.\nBeginning in the late 1920s, Fred Trump built hundreds of single-family houses and row houses in the Queens and Brooklyn boroughs of New York City, and from the late 1940s he built thousands of apartment units, mostly in Brooklyn, using federal loan guarantees designed to stimulate the construction of affordable housing. During World War II he also built federally backed housing for naval personnel and shipyard workers in Virginia and Pennsylvania. In 1954 Fred was investigated by the Senate Banking Committee for allegedly abusing the loan-guarantee program by deliberately overestimating the costs of his construction projects to secure larger loans from commercial banks, enabling him to keep the difference between the loan amounts and his actual construction costs. In testimony before the Senate committee in 1954, Fred admitted that he had built the Beach Haven apartment complex in Brooklyn for $3.7 million less than the amount of his government-insured loan. Although he was not charged with any crime, he was thereafter unable to obtain federal loan guarantees. A decade later a New York state investigation found that Fred had used his profit on a state-insured construction loan to build a shopping center that was entirely his own property. He eventually returned $1.2 million to the state but was thereafter unable to obtain state loan guarantees for residential projects in the Coney Island area of Brooklyn.\nDonald Trump attended New York Military Academy (1959–64), a private boarding school; Fordham University in the Bronx (1964–66); and the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Finance and Commerce (1966–68), where he graduated with a bachelor’s degree in economics. In 1968, during the Vietnam War, he secured a diagnosis of bone spurs, which qualified him for a medical exemption from the military draft (he had earlier received four draft deferments for education). Upon his graduation Trump began working full-time for his father’s business, helping to manage its holdings of rental housing, then estimated at between 10,000 and 22,000 units. In 1974 he became president of a conglomeration of Trump-owned corporations and partnerships, which he later named the Trump Organization.\nDuring the 1960s and early 1970s, Trump-owned housing developments in New York City, Cincinnati, Ohio, and Norfolk, Virginia, were the target of several complaints of racial discrimination against African Americans and other minority groups. In 1973 Fred and Donald Trump, along with their company, were sued by the U.S. Justice Department for allegedly violating the Fair Housing Act (1968) in the operation of 39 apartment buildings in New York City. The Trumps initially countersued the Justice Department for $100 million, alleging harm to their reputations. The suit was settled two years later under an agreement that did not require the Trumps to admit guilt.\nIn the late 1970s and the 1980s, Donald Trump greatly expanded his father’s business by investing in luxury hotels and residential properties and by shifting its geographic focus to Manhattan and later to Atlantic City, New Jersey. In doing so, he relied heavily on loans, gifts, and other financial assistance from his father, as well as on his father’s political connections in New York City. In 1976 he purchased the decrepit Commodore Hotel near Grand Central Station under a complex profit-sharing agreement with the city that included a 40-year property tax abatement, the first such tax break granted to a commercial property in New York City. Relying on a construction loan guaranteed by his father and the Hyatt Corporation, which became a partner in the project, Trump refurbished the building and reopened it in 1980 as the 1,400-room Grand Hyatt Hotel. In 1983 he opened Trump Tower, an office, retail, and residential complex constructed in partnership with the Equitable Life Assurance Company. The 58-story building on 56th Street and Fifth Avenue eventually contained Trump’s Manhattan residence and the headquarters of the Trump Organization. Other Manhattan properties developed by Trump during the 1980s include the Trump Plaza residential cooperative (1984), the Trump Parc luxury condominium complex (1986), and the 19-story Plaza Hotel (1988), a historic landmark for which Trump paid more than $400 million.\nIn the 1980s Trump invested heavily in the casino business in Atlantic City, where his properties eventually included Harrah’s at Trump Plaza (1984, later renamed Trump Plaza), Trump’s Castle Casino Resort (1985), and the Trump Taj Mahal (1990), then the largest casino in the world. During that period Trump also purchased the New Jersey Generals, a team in the short-lived U.S. Football League; Mar-a-Lago, a 118-room mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, built in the 1920s by the cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post; a 282-foot yacht, then the world’s second largest, which he named the Trump Princess; and an East Coast air-shuttle service, which he called Trump Shuttle.\nIn 1977 Trump married Ivana Zelníčková Winklmayr, a Czech model, with whom he had three children—Donald, Jr., Ivanka, and Eric—before the couple divorced in 1992. Their married life, as well as Trump’s business affairs, were a staple of the tabloid press in New York City during the 1980s. Trump married the American actress Marla Maples after she gave birth to Trump’s fourth child, Tiffany, in 1993. Their marriage ended in divorce in 1999. In 2005 Trump married the Slovene model Melania Knauss, and their son, Barron, was born the following year. Melania Trump became the second foreign-born first lady of the United States upon Trump’s inauguration as president in 2017.\nWhen the U.S. economy fell into recession in 1990, many of Trump’s businesses suffered, and he soon had trouble making payments on his approximately $5 billion debt, some $900 million of which he had personally guaranteed. Under a restructuring agreement with several banks, Trump was forced to surrender his airline, which was taken over by US Airways in 1992; to sell the Trump Princess; to take out second or third mortgages on nearly all of his properties and to reduce his ownership stakes in them; and to commit himself to living on a personal budget of $450,000 a year. Despite those measures, the Trump Taj Mahal declared bankruptcy in 1991, and two other casinos owned by Trump, as well as his Plaza Hotel in New York City, went bankrupt in 1992. Following those setbacks, most major banks refused to do any further business with him. Estimates of Trump’s net worth during this period ranged from $1.7 billion to minus $900 million.\nTrump’s fortunes rebounded with the stronger economy of the later 1990s and with the decision of the Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank AG to establish a presence in the U.S. commercial real estate market. Deutsche Bank extended hundreds of millions of dollars in credit to Trump in the late 1990s and the 2000s for projects including Trump World Tower (2001) in New York and Trump International Hotel and Tower (2009) in Chicago. In the early 1990s Trump had floated a plan to his creditors to convert his Mar-a-Lago estate into a luxury housing development consisting of several smaller mansions, but local opposition led him instead to turn it into a private club, which was opened in 1995. In 1996 Trump partnered with the NBC television network to purchase the Miss Universe Organization, which produced the Miss Universe, Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA beauty pageants. Trump’s casino businesses continued to struggle, however: in 2004 his company Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts filed for bankruptcy after several of its properties accumulated unmanageable debt, and the same company, renamed Trump Entertainment Resorts, went bankrupt again in 2009.\nBeginning in the mid-2000s, Trump enjoyed an enormous financial windfall from the success of The Apprentice, a reality television series in which he starred that directly earned him nearly $200 million over a 16-year period. The Emmy-nominated show, in each episode of which Trump “fired” one or more contestants competing for a lucrative one-year contract as a Trump employee, further enhanced his reputation as a shrewd businessman and self-made billionaire. In 2008 the show was revamped as The Celebrity Apprentice, which featured news makers and entertainers as contestants.\nTrump marketed his name as a brand in numerous other business ventures, including Trump Financial, a mortgage company, and the Trump Entrepreneur Initiative (formerly Trump University), an online education company focusing on real estate investment and entrepreneurialism. The latter firm, which ceased operating in 2011, was the target of class-action lawsuits by former students and a separate action by the attorney general of New York state, alleging fraud. After initially denying the allegations, Trump settled the lawsuits for $25 million in November 2016. In 2019, more than two years into his presidency, Trump agreed to pay $2 million in damages and to admit guilt to settle another lawsuit by the attorney general of New York that had accused him of illegally using assets from his charity, the Trump Foundation, to fund his 2016 presidential campaign. As part of the settlement, the Trump Foundation was dissolved.\nIn 2018 The New York Times published a lengthy investigative report that documented how Fred Trump had regularly transferred vast sums of money, ultimately amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars, to his children by means of strategies that involved tax, securities, and real estate fraud, as well as by legal means. According to the report, Donald Trump was the main beneficiary of the transfers, having received the equivalent (in 2018 dollars) of $413 million by the early 2000s. According to a later report by the Times, based on data from tax returns filed by Trump during an 18-year period starting in 2000, Trump paid no federal taxes in 11 years and only $750 in each of two years, 2016 and 2017. Trump was able to reduce his tax obligations to levels significantly below the average for the wealthiest Americans by claiming massive losses on many of his businesses; by deducting as business expenses costs associated with his residences and his personal aircraft; and by receiving, on the basis of business losses, a tentative refund from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of nearly $73 million, which more than covered the federal taxes Trump had paid on income he received from The Apprentice in 2005–08. The refund became the subject of an IRS audit and a legally mandated review by the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation.\nTrump was credited as coauthor of a number of books on entrepreneurship and his business career, including Trump: The Art of the Deal (1987), Trump: The Art of the Comeback (1997), Why We Want You to Be Rich (2006), Trump 101: The Way to Success (2006), and Trump Never Give Up: How I Turned My Biggest Challenges into Success (2008)."

Asian shares are mostly up after US stocks inch to more records as inflation slows\nWorld shares are mostly higher, buoyed by gains of tech-related stocks after Wall Street inched to more records following a surprisingly encouraging report on inflation and a stunning forecast for growth from Oracle because of the AI boom\nMANILA, Philippines -- World shares were mostly higher Thursday, buoyed by gains of tech-related stocks after Wall Street inched to more records following a surprisingly encouraging report on inflation and a stunning forecast for growth from Oracle because of the artificial intelligence boom.\nIn early European trading, Germany's DAX was nearly flat at 23,631.29. Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.4% to 9,259.17, while France's CAC 40 climbed 0.5% to 7,803.52.\nIn Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 added 1.2% to 44,372.50, with tech investment company SoftBank Group’s shares jumping 8.3% in a second straight day of gains.\nData released Thursday showed Japan’s producer prices rose 2.7% year-on-year in August from a 2.5% rise the previous month, in line with market expectations. The higher cost of food, transport equipment and machinery contributed to the rise in prices.\nIn Chinese markets, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index slid 0.4% to 26,086.32 while the Shanghai Composite index rose 1.7% to 3,875.31.\nShares of chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp added more than 6%, while Hua Hong Semiconductor rose 3.8%. Cambricon Technologies, often called China’s Nvidia, climbed 9%.\nSouth Korea's Kospi climbed 0.9% to 3,344.20 while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was down 0.3% to 8,805.00. India's BSE Sensex added nearly 0.2% while Taiwan's Taiex rose 0.1%, trimming earlier gains.\nThe future for the S&P 500 rose 0.1% while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average added less than 0.1%.\n“Asia’s Thursday tape was the kind of market that looks lively from a distance but flat when you press your nose against the glass. After Wall Street’s record sprint, traders in Tokyo and Seoul tried to carry the baton. Still, Hong Kong and Sydney promptly fumbled it, leaving the MSCI Asia-Pacific index pacing on the spot after five straight daily advances,” Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a market commentary.\nOn Wall Street, the S&P 500 rose 0.3% on Wednesday and set an all-time high for a second straight day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 220 points, or 0.5%, and the Nasdaq composite edged up by less than 0.1% after both set records the day before.\nStocks have hit records in large part because Wall Street is expecting the economy to pull off a delicate balancing act: slowing enough to convince the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, but not so much that it causes a recession, all while inflation remains under control.\nPopular Reads\nMany things must go right for that to happen, and an encouraging signal came from a report Wednesday saying inflation at the U.S. wholesale level unexpectedly slowed in August.\nA potentially more important report is coming Thursday, which will show how bad inflation has been for U.S. households.\nTraders were already convinced the Fed will deliver its first cut to interest rates of the year at its next meeting, but they need inflation data until then to be mild enough not to derail those expectations.\nOn Wall Street, tech stocks led the way after Oracle said AI-related demand is set to send its revenue surging. Oracle stock leaped 35.9% for its best day since 1992, even though it also reported results for the latest quarter that came up just shy of analysts’ expectations.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which makes chips used in AI and other computing, saw its stock that trades in the U.S. climb 3.8% after it said its revenue jumped nearly 34% in August from a year earlier.\nOn the losing side of Wall Street was Apple, whose drop of 3.2% helped drag the Dow lower and was the heaviest single weight on the S&P 500. Some analysts said its unveiling of new iPhones the day before contained no surprises and may not drive much growth in demand.\nIn other dealings Thursday, benchmark U.S. crude shed 11 cents to $63.56 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 8 cents to $67.41 per barrel.\nThe U.S. dollar rose to 147.88 yen from 147.36 yen.

        "World shares advance as investors shrug off US government shutdown. World shares advance as investors shrug off US government shutdown\nWorld shares have jumped, tracking Wall Street’s rise to new records despite the the shutdown of the U.S. federal government\nMANILA, Philippines -- World shares advanced on Thursday, tracking Wall Street's rise to records despite the the shutdown of the U.S. government.\nTechnology shares jumped on expectations of higher demand for computer chips due to a partnership between South Korean tech firms and OpenAI.\nThe future for S&P 500 was up nearly 0.2% while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down less than 0.1%\nIn early European trading, Germany's DAX added 1.3% to 24,435.24 while France's CAC 40 climbed nearly 1.2% to 8,058.80, also fueled by tech shares. Britain’s FTSE 100 edged up less than 0.1% to 9,452.81.\nIn Asia, South Korea's Kospi closed 2.7% higher at 3,549.21 a day after Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix announced their agreement with OpenAI to supply its Stargate data hubs with memory chips.\n“We expect export growth to remain resilient, led by higher chip prices, which will likely continue to offset the tariff impact on non-chip sectors such as autos,” the Nomura Group said in a commentary.\nShares in Samsung jumped 3.5%, while SK Hynix's shares gained 9.9%. Taiwan-based chip maker TSMC's shares climbed 3%, helping lift the Taiex by 1.5%.\nJapan's Nikkei 225 added 0.9% to 44,936.73, with tech stocks leading gains.\nHong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 1.6% to 27,287.12. Markets in mainland China were closed for the Oct. 1-8 National Day holiday.\nAustralia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 1.1% to 8,945.90, with gold mining stocks among those leading gains. India's BSE Sensex added 0.9% after the Reserve Bank of India opted to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged.\nOn Wednesday, stocks rose to more records in U.S. trading, though yields sank in the bond market following the latest discouraging signals on the economy.\nThe S&P 500 climbed 0.3% to 6,711.20, topping its prior all-time high set last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.1%, to its own record set the day before, closing at 46,441.10. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.4% to 22,755.16.\n“Markets once again proved that they love nothing more than turning a crisis into a stage set for higher prices,” Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary.\nEmployers outside the government actually cut 32,000 more jobs than they added in September, according to the survey by ADP Research, with the Midwest particularly hard hit. The survey also revised down its numbers for employment in August, to a loss of 3,000 jobs from a previously reported gain of 54,000.\nUsually, traders on Wall Street wait for a more comprehensive U.S. government jobs report to suss out how the job market is doing. The U.S. government gets its data from a larger sample of employers than the ADP survey.\nBut the next Labor Department report, scheduled for Friday, is likely to be delayed because of the shutdown of the U.S. government that began just after midnight.\nThe hope on Wall Street has been that the job market will continue to slow just enough to convince the Federal Reserve to keep cutting interest rates, but not by so much that it brings a recession.\nThat’s a delicate balance to achieve, and every economic report from the U.S. government that gets delayed only increases the uncertainty about whether it’s possible. Stocks have already run to records on expectations for coming cuts to rates, so a lack of them could send the market lower.\nIn other dealings on Thursday, U.S. benchmark crude oil shed 11 cents to $61.67 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, edged down 11 cents to $65.24 per barrel.\nThe U.S. dollar fell to 146.69 Japanese yen from 147.08 yen. The euro rose to $1.1761 from $1.1731.\nThe price of gold seesawed between gains and losses after surging to fresh highs. As of Thursday, it was up $3.20 at $3,900.70 per ounce. The precious metal, often used as a safe haven for investments in times of uncertainty, has been steadily climbing for months, gaining more than 37% in the past year.\n___\nAP Business Writers Stan Choe and Matt Ott contributed.\nSponsored Content by Taboola\nPopular Reads\nABC News Live\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",
        "Asian shares retreat after Intel helped drive Wall Street to more records. Asian shares retreat after Intel helped drive Wall Street to more records\nAsian shares mostly retreat after a rally of technology stocks led by Nvidia and Intel pushed Wall Street to more records\nMANILA, Philippines -- Asian shares mostly retreated Friday after a rally of technology stocks led by Nvidia and Intel pushed Wall Street to more records.\nJapan's Nikkei 225 switched from gains to losses and was down nearly 1.4% to 44,667.88 as of early afternoon, after the Bank of Japan decided to keep its benchmark short-term interest rate unchanged at 0.5%. Data released Friday also showed the country's annual inflation in August slowed to a 10-month low at 2.7%, from 3.1% the previous month.\nIn Chinese markets, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index added 0.1% to 26,576.59 while the Shanghai Composite index was down less than 0.1% to 3,830.65. Investors are awaiting a phone call later Friday between President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping on tariffs and finalizing a deal to allow TikTok to keep operating in the United States.\nAustralia’s S&P/ASX 200 climbed 0.6% to 8,799.80 after losses a day earlier, when data indicated the jobs market was showing signs of softness.\nSouth Korea' Kospi fell 0.7% to 3,436.48. India's BSE Sensex edged down 0.4%, trimming earlier gains. Taiwan's Taiex dipped 0.4%.\nWall Street rolled to more records Thursday as Nvidia and Intel led a rally for technology stocks on the announcement of their deal that includes a $5 billion investment.\nThe S&P 500 rose 0.5% and is on track for a third straight winning week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 124 points, or 0.3%, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.9%. All three set all-time highs.\nIntel soared 22.8% for its best day since 1987 after Nvidia said it would buy $5 billion of the chipmaker’s stock. It’s part of a collaboration where the pair will develop products for data centers and personal computers. Nvidia climbed 3.5% and was by far the strongest force lifting the S&P 500 because it’s Wall Street’s most valuable company.\nEncouraging reports on the economy sent Treasury yields climbing in the bond market, meanwhile, including one that said fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week than expected.\nThat could indicate the pace of layoffs is slowing, and it was a relief after the prior week’s data showed a disconcerting leap to a four-year high. The job market has slowed so much that the Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut its main interest rate for the first time this year in order to give it some help.\nThe Fed also indicated more cuts may be on the way, though Chair Jerome Powell warned that the Fed is in a precarious position and may have to change course quickly. That’s because the economy is in an unusual situation where the job market is slowing while inflation is remaining stubbornly high at the same time.\nThe Fed is in charge of fixing both, but it has only one tool to do so. And helping one by moving interest rates often hurts the other in the short term.\nExpectations are high on Wall Street that the Fed will keep cutting interest rates, and an unexpected halt could send stocks tumbling. Critics say stock prices have already shot too high and become too expensive, in part because of heavy bets on continued cuts in rates.\nOn Wall Street, smaller stocks led the way. They can be some of the biggest beneficiaries of easier interest rates, and the Russell 2000 index of small stocks rallied 2.5% to join its bigger rivals in setting all-time highs. It topped its prior record, which was set in 2021.\nIn other dealings on Friday, benchmark U.S. crude lost 19 cents to $63.38 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, shed 11 cents to $66.81 per barrel.\nThe U.S. dollar slid to 147.38 yen from 147.92 yen. The euro slipped to $1.1774 from $1.790.\n__\nAP Business Writers Stan Choe contributed from New York.\nSponsored Content by Taboola\nPopular Reads\nABC News Live\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

        "“Abundance” Lobby Uses Trendy Words to Hide Same Old Attacks on the Environment. Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.\nOne of the Trump administration’s top priorities has been its devastating, unilateral rollback of renewable energy projects and environmental regulations — and a corresponding, aggressive push for fossil fuel interests.\nBut to hear a growing chorus of “abundance” proponents tell it, the real obstacle to climate progress is environmental regulation itself.\nIn a disturbing trend, influential politicians and commentators are propagating the idea that U.S. environmental regulation is too stringent, which they blame for stalling worthwhile progress in all sorts of key realms, from housing to mass transit to renewable energy projects. Proponents of this worldview loosely refer to their agenda as “abundance,” which they say characterizes the techno-utopia we can build if we eliminate regulatory constraints.\nNever miss another story\nGet the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day.\nAs an illustration, organizers of the “Abundance” conference taking place this week in Washington, D.C., describe the “abundance” movement as “a cross-partisan coalition committed to accelerating economic growth, reinforcing American leadership in science and technology, dismantling bureaucratic inertia, restoring effective governance, and reducing the cost of living.”\nThere are many unfounded ideological assumptions in this statement. Is “bureaucratic inertia” a significant obstacle to desirable outcomes in energy, housing, transportation, or any other sector? Does “restoring effective governance” entail less regulation, necessarily? Is “reducing the cost of living” the single most important thing we can do to relieve the serious economic hardship that many people face today? The “abundance” lobby wants us to believe that the answer to each of these questions is “yes.”\nThis argument isn’t just being made by polluting industries and their supporters, but also by people supposedly concerned about mitigating climate change. They claim that environmental regulations are getting in the way of building renewable energy capacity quickly (although a great many of these critics are not specialists in environmental policy.) One approving reviewer of Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson’s book Abundance, for example, claims that the “biggest thing blocking the greening of American energy” has been “progressive environmental laws that have allowed NIMBYs to sue solar plants and transmission lines into oblivion,” asserting this as the truth without a shred of evidence.\nIn the recent past, this idea was referred to as “permitting reform” and primarily associated with fossil fuel backers like former Sen. Joe Manchin (D-West Virginia). Now it’s gotten a rebrand. Whatever you call it, the justification for a deregulatory “abundance” agenda is flat-out wrong. But like many bad ideas with powerful backers, it could still become conventional wisdom unless it’s aggressively dispelled.\nWhat’s Actually Blocking Renewable Energy?\nThe “abundance” lobby cites only anecdotal evidence, such as the long delays and cost overruns for high-speed rail construction in California, to support their claim of regulations choking the growth of renewable energy and clean transportation. Data and peer-reviewed studies tell a different story.\nAt a logistical level, the wait time for new generation capacity to connect to the grid — known as the interconnection queue — is the main obstacle to bringing renewable energy online. In practice, what this means is that permitted (and sometimes fully built) solar and wind generation and energy storage projects have to wait for years for permission to connect to the grid. In 2023, the electric generation and storage capacity waiting in the interconnection queue was more than twice the installed generation capacity in the U.S.\nWhat’s more, the capacity in the interconnection queue was overwhelmingly wind and solar generation and energy storage, while the existing capacity was dominated by fossil energy. This problem can be fixed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) directing regional grid operators to connect renewable energy to the grid quickly — in other words, more regulation.\nA peer-reviewed study has shown that most delays in permitting under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) are attributable to budgetary constraints limiting the ability of permitting agencies to hire sufficient numbers of qualified staff (sometimes because of spending cuts by Congress), and staff turnover at permitting agencies (where qualified staff reviewing a project sometimes leave the agency before the review is complete), along with project backers failing to get key information to permitting agencies — not to the stringency of the NEPA permitting process. Another peer-reviewed study concluded that the vast majority of renewable energy projects are already subject to streamlined procedures, or not subject to federal permitting review at all.\nThis isn’t to say that stories of renewable projects getting tied up with bureaucratic delays are untrue. But to use them as an argument for weakening environmental review is like using the proliferation of online hate and misinformation to justify curbs on legitimate free speech. Procedural protections exist for a reason, and it’s a terrible idea to weaken them just because bad faith players sometimes misuse them.\nCuriously, “abundance” proponents are largely not advancing proposals to speed up permitting of renewable energy exclusively while limiting or banning fossil fuels. Instead, it appears they want to weaken environmental regulation period.\nBut if more fossil fuel infrastructure is built as a consequence of weakening environmental review, the earth’s climate is cooked. This is basic math. If the U.S. keeps expanding its fossil fuel production, these fuels will keep emitting greenhouse gases when burned. Even if domestic fossil fuel use is rapidly replaced with renewables, the excess oil and gas produced will be exported to emit greenhouse gases somewhere else.\nBut “abundance” advocates have not made opposing new fossil fuel infrastructure a core plank of their agenda, raising the possibility that their professed concern for climate mitigation may be disingenuous.\nJustice Denied\nStrikingly missing from the “abundance” agenda is any serious consideration of justice.\nTwenty-one percent of income in the U.S. goes to the top 1 percent of earners, while the bottom half of income earners receive only 13 percent. The wealthiest 10 percent of households own more than two-thirds of wealth in the U.S., while the bottom half of households by wealth own only 2.5 percent. The racial wealth gap is striking, with Black families twice as likely as white families to have a net wealth of zero.\nIn this context, attributing the inability of large numbers of people to access basic necessities like electricity or heating to physical shortages — instead of to poverty and extreme inequality — is naive at best.\nWe have a serious energy poverty problem in the U.S., with 27 percent of all households experiencing difficulty paying their energy bills. These numbers go up to 52 percent for Black and Indigenous households, and 57 percent for households with an annual income below $10,000.\nHowever, the U.S. produces more oil and gas than needed to meet domestic demand, and is a net exporter. Likewise, we generate enough electricity to meet demand, and our electric grid is highly reliable. Increasing supply is not going to solve a problem rooted in economic and racial inequality.\nA large body of peer-reviewed scientific studies have demonstrated how communities have been treated as sacrifice zones for the benefit of polluting industries, on the basis of race and class. Weakening environmental regulations will worsen these disparities, by robbing communities of the few legal protections they have from polluting industry. A mentality solely focused on rapidly scaling upwards — without any regard for expanding environmental justice — will only exacerbate these inequalities.\nThe Same Old Bad Ideas\nFor all of the attention it’s received, “abundance” is hardly a new idea. It combines two bad ideas from the past, presented in a shiny new package.\nOne is “all of the above” energy policy, the official (and dangerously wrong) Obama energy doctrine. Every credible analysis shows that in order to avert climate catastrophe, it’s imperative to phase out fossil fuel production even as we expand renewable energy.\nThe other bad idea embodied in abundance is trickle-down economics: ignore inequality and expand the economic pie, and people at the bottom will benefit. That’s why “abundance” advocates insist on expanding supply instead of addressing distribution. Decades of experience with trickle-down economics shows that it makes the rich richer at the expense of the rest of us.\nThe notion of “abundance” has superficial appeal, even to unsuspecting progressives. It invokes job creation, higher material living standards for all, and mitigating climate change by building more renewable energy. That’s why it’s important to understand it as a resurrection of trickle-down economics to support a fossil fuel industry agenda.\nProgressives must fight for a very different agenda to solve real-world problems of poverty, climate change, and scarcity of affordable housing, clean transportation, and health care. Unlike the “abundance” vision, the progressive agenda needs to be community-driven and not top-down. We must wrest power from the wealthy and powerful interests who are the real reason why we can’t have good things, acting together to confront the fossil fuel industry, Wall Street banks, health insurers, and corrupt government officials who side with these industries instead of the public interest.\nKeep the press free. Fight political repression.\nTruthout urgently appeals for your support. Under pressure from an array of McCarthyist anti-speech tactics, independent journalists at Truthout face new and mounting political repression.\nWe rely on your support to publish journalism from the frontlines of political movements.

        "Australia news live: Pocock says Labor’s emissions target not ambitious enough after Ley lashes government’s ‘trifecta’ of energy failures. David Pocock says emissions reduction target ‘not ambitious enough’\nIndependent senator David Pocock just spoke to the media about the emissions reduction targets, saying the levels announced by the Albanese government did not go far enough to address the major threat of climate change.\nHe said:\nIt is not ambitious enough to allow us to go to the world stage and to push big emitters, the rest of the world, to do better. We know what is at stake. We have seen in the national climate assessment just what climate change is going to do to our country, is going to do to our communities, the ocean that we love, the reefs that we love, the bushland that we love, the native species that make this continent so incredible.\nAnd yet we have a government that is not listening to the science.\nPocock added:\nWe cannot give up on this. We have to keep fighting and keep pushing, the Labor party, the major parties to take our future seriously.\nTownsville mayor Troy Thompson has responded to the announcement that he faces sacking from the council in parliament this morning.\nThompson was elected mayor last year, but was suspended over allegations he’d misled the electorate about his military history. Local government minister Ann Leahy told parliament she had issued him with a 14-day show cause notice to explain why he shouldn’t be dismissed from the council. Thompson said on Facebook:\nThese are allegations – not findings. And they have been brought forward by a minister who, in my view, is politically conflicted in this matter. Her recent comments suggest more about point-scoring and political distraction than genuine concern for due process or the Townsville community.\nMy legal team is prepared to respond in full once the allegations have been formally provided. Until now I have not been afforded natural justice by either the state or local government. That is unacceptable in a democratic system that claims to value fairness and integrity.\nThompson was referred to the state’s Crime and Corruption Commission last year after allegations he embellished his military record by stating he spent five years in the army, including time with “SAS Swanbourne”.\nTownsville mayor asked to ‘show cause’ to save job\nControversial Townsville mayor Troy Thompson will be issued with a show cause notice today to explain why he shouldn’t be sacked by the state government.\nLocal government minister Anne Leahy told parliament on Thursday that she had made the decision after a briefing by the Crime and Corruption Commission last month which “set out serious allegations”. Leahy said:\nI will today issue councillor Thomson with a formal show cause notice. This will provide him with 14 days to respond and sets out in detail the basis of my concerns, as required under Section 120 of the Local Government Act 2009. The notice includes a detailed explanation of the factual basis for forming my reasonable belief that dismissal may be appropriate.\nFollowing the 14-day period and upon receipt of councillor Thomson’s response, I will carefully consider the matters raised before making a final decision.\nMr Speaker, these are serious matters, and the actions I have taken reflect this government’s firm commitment to transparency, natural justice and the highest standards of integrity in local government. At every step, my focus has been on the people of Townsville, they deserve a council that is stable, accountable and able to deliver for its community.\nThompson was elected as Townsville mayor last year. He was suspended by Leahy on full pay after allegations he misled the electorate about his military history.\nLittleproud says Nationals won’t support ‘nonsense’ targets\nUnsurprisingly, Littleproud says of the target:\nSo we won’t be supporting these interim targets. We won’t be legislating targets. That’s nonsense.\nWhat we’ll do is be responsible. What we will be is sensible and what we’ll make sure is we put Australian families and Australian business at the core of this because, coming to Australian families, whether it be directly through job losses or through their energy bill or through their food bill or whether their daily movement around this country, you are going to pay the price of this.\nClimate target ‘nothing more than an expensive charade’, Nationals leader says\nNationals leader David Littleproud is speaking about Labor’s new emissions target.\nHe says it’s “nothing more than an expensive charade on the people of Australia”.\nThe reality is that in three years of government they haven’t reduced emissions at all, yet they’re trying to tell us that they’re going to take us from around 26 to 28% of reduction that we achieved … to 62% by 2035. They can’t do it and they can’t explain how they’re going to do it. And the detail around the cost. Australians need to know that they’re going to foot the bill for this. They’re going to foot a very expensive bill, either through their energy bills but also through their grocery bills and everything else they buy. So the Albanese government is very much big on rhetoric, but not a lot on detail.\n‘Worst is over’ when it comes to cocoa prices but retail chocolate prices to remain high for longer\nThe cost of cocoa is forecast to reduce significantly by mid-2027, but retail chocolate prices will take longer to fall and are still expected to remain higher than they were four years ago.\nResearchers at the agribusiness bank have published a new report that found consumers can expect some relief from rising chocolate prices, which are today more than 50% higher than they were in 2021.\nThe price has jumped markedly in the last year alone. In September last year, a premium-branded 100g chocolate tablet retailed at EUR 2.93 at the time at a Dutch supermarket, the report said.\nThe same product is now retailing at EUR 3.95, an increase of nearly 35% in just 12 months.\nPaul Joules, an agriculture analysist at RaboResearch, says the surge in retail chocolate prices was caused by a “cocoa shock” or crisis in the industry caused by poor harvests, crop disease and “structural supply issues”.\nJoules says while the worst is over, global cocoa prices will remain above “pre-crisis” levels due to ongoing issues including aging trees, crop disease, and climate volatility, which means retail prices could take longer to fall. He said:\nThe chocolate market is entering a new era of higher costs and persistent volatility, requiring agility and continuous adaptation from industry players.\nWhile the peak of chocolate retail price inflation may be behind us, the pressure remains, and the industry is hedging its bets for a resilient future.\nDavid Pocock says emissions reduction target ‘not ambitious enough’\nIndependent senator David Pocock just spoke to the media about the emissions reduction targets, saying the levels announced by the Albanese government did not go far enough to address the major threat of climate change.\nHe said:\nIt is not ambitious enough to allow us to go to the world stage and to push big emitters, the rest of the world, to do better. We know what is at stake. We have seen in the national climate assessment just what climate change is going to do to our country, is going to do to our communities, the ocean that we love, the reefs that we love, the bushland that we love, the native species that make this continent so incredible.\nAnd yet we have a government that is not listening to the science.\nPocock added:\nWe cannot give up on this. We have to keep fighting and keep pushing, the Labor party, the major parties to take our future seriously.\nLey says there is ‘no division’ among Coalition to oppose ‘latest piece of trainwreck energy policy’\nLey said she just came out of a shadow cabinet meeting and said the Coalition is unified in its plans to oppose the emissions reductions targets.\nShe said:\nI can assure you there was absolutely no division in opposing Labor’s latest piece of trainwreck energy policy. And we know that we’re doing this on behalf of hard-working Australians who actually expect better from a government whose credibility is in tatters.\nSussan Ley on emissions reduction target: ‘you cannot trust a single thing this government says’\nThe opposition leader, Sussan Ley, says the Albanese government’s emissions reduction targets “fails on both counts” when it came to cost and credibility, adding she is deeply concerned about how much the plan will cost Australians and the details as to how it will take place.\nShe said during a press conference:\nUnder this government we’re seeing a trifecta of energy failures. Costs are up. Reliability is down. And emissions are flatlining.\n… You cannot trust a single thing this government says.\nIf the government wants to have an honest conversation with Australians, they need to be upfront about announcements they make in critical areas of energy. Energy is the economy. They need to be upfront about what it will actually cost. Australians deserve to know this.\nMore than 600,000 Indigenous and Torres Strait Islander people enrolled to vote\nFor the first time, the estimated Indigenous enrolment rate is more than 600,000 people, according to new figures from the Australian Electoral Commission.\nThe new data shows an estimated 93% of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are now enrolled to vote, with 16,000 First Nations people estimated to have enrolled in the past year. The AEC has visited 50 communities since the 2025 election to improve electoral participation.\nThe national enrolment rate for the general population is 98.1%.\nJeff Pope, the acting commissioner of the AEC, said in a statement:\nWe’ve been working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities for many years now as part of our commitment to closing the gap in the Indigenous enrolment rate.\nThere is clearly still more work to do, but we’re very pleased with the significant increases to the figures over the past several years.\nAustralian government announces 2035 emissions reduction target – video\nIn his announcement, prime minister Anthony Albanese said: “It is the right target to protect our environment, to protect and advance our economy and jobs and to ensure that we act in our national interest and in the interest of this and future generations”.\nEmissions reduction target ‘a denial of climate justice’, 350.org says\n350.org, a major international climate change group, said the targets announced today were “nowhere near what is needed to secure our survival”.\nFenton Lutunatabua, the group’s deputy head of regions, said in a statement:\nAnything less than a 75% cut this decade backed by a plan to phase out coal, oil and gas is not a climate plan, it’s a denial of climate justice.\nPacific peoples are already living the losses that come from every fraction of a degree of warming. The supposed ‘sweet spot’ decided by the Albanese government is nowhere near what is needed to secure our survival. Not only that, but it doesn’t address the enormous burden of Australia’s fossil fuel exports, the consequences of which the children of the Pacific will have to bear.\nBrittany Higgins to appeal damages after defamation ruling\nBrittany Higgins will appeal a $341k payout and 80% of legal costs to her former boss, ex-Liberal senator Linda Reynolds, after a Western Australian supreme court ruled last month she defamed the once-Liberal frontbencher in two social media posts.\nTottle ruled Reynolds’ reputation was damaged by a 2022 social media post from Higgins’ partner David Sharaz, which Higgins responded to, as well as an Instagram story published by Higgins in July 2023.\nHiggins’ legal team, however, successfully defended a third social media post – also found to be defamatory – as honest opinion, fair comment and qualified privilege. Reynolds was unable to prove Higgins and Sharaz had concocted a conspiracy to publicly release the details of Higgins’s alleged rape with the “sole or predominant purpose” of destroying the former senator’s reputation, Tottle’s judgment said.\nThe court ruled that Higgins pay $315,000 in damages with an additional $26,109.25 in interest. Earlier this month, the court made a separate ruling on additional costs, ordering Higgins to pay 80% of Reynolds’ legal costs for the five-week defamation trial. It’s expected the total bill will easily surpass million-dollar territory.\nThe appeal notices show Higgins’ legal team is not appealing the judgment but focusing on the damages payout and the direction to pay 80% of Reynolds’ legal bills.\nAnalysis: Labor's climate targets promise everyone a prize\nAdam Morton\nThe Albanese government has announced an Oprah Winfrey-style emissions target for 2035 - tried to promise (nearly) everyone a prize.\nWe haven’t had time to absorb the advice that underpins it, but the range of 62% to 70% is clearly at least partly a political solution. It is extraordinarily wide.\nAt the bottom end, the goal is clearly designed to dampen criticism from business organisations arguing for less action. At the top end it meets a demand from some scientists and climate campaigners that it must include a number with a “7” in front of it - that is, that it reaches into the 70s.\nThis won’t be enough to nullify criticism: it is already pouring into my inbox from climate-focused organisations and scientists. The reality is the target sets a minimum goal of 62% but scientists say the country’s part in meeting the goals of the 2015 Paris agreement would be more than 75% - possibly significantly more.\nThe range is well below what the Climate Change Authority thought was “ambitious, but achievable” early last year when it nominated 65% to 75%. Why the change? We need more detailed answers on that than we got at the press conference.\nWill this goal help Australia take a leading role in avoiding the worst projections set out in the national risk assessment released on Monday? Certainly not if we end up at 62%.\nBut what matters now is the policies. And we will need a lot more - a lot more - to get where we need to be.\nFortescue head says Labor has shown ‘courage of leadership’ but calls for even higher emissions cuts\nAndrew Forrest, chairman of mining giant Fortescue, has also called on the government to be more ambition, arguing the upper range of 70% should be a “floor” not a ceiling.\nIt [the government] has shown the courage of leadership. Yet let me be clear: the upper range of its target – 70% – must be a floor, not a ceiling.\nA cut of at least 75% is what is needed for Australia to pursue emissions reductions in line with the science. This remains the only course that can avert the accelerating impacts of a world warmed beyond 1.5°C.\nFortescue was one of more than 500 businesses including Atlassian, Canva, and Unilever calling for a 75% target in the lead up to the announcement.\nFormer emergency leaders are also warning the target will leave emergency responders in a critical situation. The Emergency Leaders for Climate Action group warns the bottom end of the target will fall “dangerously short of what’s needed to protect both communities and emergency responders.” The former commissioner of Fire & Rescue NSW, Greg Mullins, says:\nIf that’s the level of risk we’re accepting, then what’s the plan for dealing with it? Emergency leaders want to see a concrete, well-funded plan for how the Albanese government is going to support communities and first responders to adapt to the compounding, cascading and concurrent disasters its own risk assessment outlines if we’re choosing not to cut climate pollution any further or faster.\nEnvironmental groups’ verdict on Labor emissions targets: ‘weak’\nWe’re getting plenty of reaction to the 2035 target, and environment groups are pushing for far more ambitious action.\nGreenpeace has called the target “weak” while the Australian Conservation Foundation has labelled it “timid”.\nBoth groups accuse the government of prioritising the fossil fuel industry over community safety.\nGreenpeace Australia Pacific says the target is “not science-aligned, and undermines global action under the Paris Agreement to limit warming to 1.5C”.\nIt prioritises fossil fuel profits and business interests over people, and effectively abandons our commitment under the Paris Agreement… a temperature goal that is non-negotiable for Pacific nations staring down the barrel of climate catastrophe.\nThe ACF’s climate and energy program manager, Gavan McFadzean, says:\nA target range of 62% to 70%falls significantly short on all measures of what’s needed, with the government’s plans preparing Australia only to meet the bottom end of the range.\nPM won’t say how much power bills will drop under 2035 plan\nThe prime minister says there needs to be “lean in” from all levels of government and business to get to the target.\nHe also adds that the amount of wind and solar power in China is now “nearly twice as much as the rest of the world combined. Just a fun fact”:\nWe have a target range, it depends upon as we have outlined, whether there is a lean in and by other levels of government, by the private sector as well, industry … we know that the federal government can only do so much.\nFinally, Albanese is asked exactly how much power bills will come down (which makes all the journalists in the room laugh).\nAlbanese won’t give a figure – you might remember how much the opposition likes to bring up Labor’s pre-2022 election promise of a reduction in energy bills by $275, which they had to abandon. The PM says:\nYou yourself laughed when he asked that question so, it should be treated in the spirit which you’ve done. What we know is if we do not act, they will be a cost [to] the economy as [the] treasurer has outlined. They will be: lower wages, lower growth, less jobs.",
        "Australia news live: Sussan Ley says cost of net zero ‘looks too high’ as she sidesteps question on climate ructions. Ley says cost of net zero ‘looks too high’ as she sidesteps question on climate ructions\nBenita Kolovos\nKieran Rooney from the Age asks: “How does net zero fit into your economic vision and does it undermine your leadership when your Coalition colleagues come out with such a strong position on the issue?\nLey replies:\nI’m pleased to get a question on energy, because it is one of the factors of productivity in this country that is dragging our economy backwards. And that’s something that my colleagues and I agree with wholeheartedly, which is what I’ve said, and others have said, we will not have net zero at any cost, because the cost can be too high. And right now it looks like the cost is too high when you consider what this government is about to do with its Paris targets. Let’s hold that conversation until they actually make their announcement.\nShe says the party’s policy is being led by Dan Tehan, with input from Ted O’Brien and others:\nSo our energy policy, more broadly, will be underpinned by two fundamental themes: that we must have a stable, reliable energy grid to deliver affordable energy for households and businesses, and that we will play our role in reducing emissions in a responsible and transparent way.\nLily McCaffrey from the Australian asks if Andrew Hastie crosses the floor on Barnaby Joyce’s net zero repeal deal, what’s going to happen? She also asks if it’s becoming clear that she’ll have to ditch or modify net zero by 2050.\nLey replies:\nEvery day, I get another different set of hypotheticals about a whole range of discussions that you might see in the media. So I’ll simply say this, the shadow cabinet when we meet and discuss energy will do so with the passion and the determination that I described in my previous answer about backing in Australians, their industries and their future, and I can extend that to the broader party room.\nAnd note too that all of my colleagues are participating in the discussion on energy right now, as they should. And I love it when people have strong views and express them, because they’re coming from the people they’re listening to from all corners of this country, you get the best possible outcome in decision-making, when you harness those ideas and you listen closely.\nBHP ‘unAustralian’, Queensland deputy premier says\nQueensland’s deputy premier has labelled BHP “unAustralian” anddefended the state’s mining royalties scheme after the mining giant blamed it for its decision to mothball a coalmine and cut hundreds of jobs while also reviewing the future of its training academy.\nTasmanian premier ‘disappointed’ at school closures\nTasmania’s premier has said he is “very disappointed” after staff strikes closed 18 schools across the state on Wednesday.\nSchool cleaners, grounds staff and kitchen assistants left work and rallied outside Parliament House in Hobart today, calling for improved working conditions, after years of rising workloads without an increase in staffing. The stop-work action forced about one in 10 schools across the state to close their doors.\nAmy Brumby, the Tasmania coordinator for the United Workers Union, said in a statement:\nMembers are rallying today to call for the immediate investment in [more] roles to match the reality of modern school operations and ensure student safety and educational standards can be maintained.\nTasmania’s premier, Jeremy Rockliff, told reporters:\nI’m very disappointed at the school closures today. Parents and families are being disrupted and our young people are there to go to school and to learn.\nRockliff rejected responsibility for the closures and said he was confident continued negotiations would resolve the disputes, describing the government’s recent offer of a 3% pay rise to all state employees as “very strong”:\nI’m a very big believer in supporting our facility attendants to be rewarded for the work that they do.\nThe Tasmanian government confirmed there was no indication that further school closures were expected. Negotiations are ongoing.\nUTS’s teacher education program set to close as university reveals plan to slash more than 1,000 subjects\nThe University of Technology Sydney will close its teacher education program and public health school as part of a sweeping restructure that would remove more than 1,100 subjects to return the institution to surplus.\nThe proposed cuts, released on Wednesday, are part of the debt-ridden university’s strategy to reduce expenditure by $100m annually.\nUnder the proposal, the school of professional practice and leadership would be closed as part of a plan to reduce the total number of schools from 24 to 15, and the faculty of law, business school and transdisciplinary school would be combined.\nLast squad of NSW RFS deployed in Canada return home after devastating wildfire season\nThe last contingent of NSW Rural Fire Service personnel arrived back in Australia after a long deployment aiding Canada with its wildfire season.\nThe agency said the returning personnel were now planning to enjoy “well deserved rest before the official start of bush fire danger period”.\nCanada saw one of its worst fire seasons on record, with scientists warning climate change was prolonging and exacerbating the burning. Thousands of fires across the country scorched more than 8.7m hectares of land, with officials warning last month the figures were Canada’s “new reality”.\nLey says cost of net zero ‘looks too high’ as she sidesteps question on climate ructions\nBenita Kolovos\nKieran Rooney from the Age asks: “How does net zero fit into your economic vision and does it undermine your leadership when your Coalition colleagues come out with such a strong position on the issue?\nLey replies:\nI’m pleased to get a question on energy, because it is one of the factors of productivity in this country that is dragging our economy backwards.

She quips that she’s not going to make a “political hit here about what I see on the government benches” as it would be “gratuitous”. She adds:\nBut I love big ideas. We all do – our party members do, my colleagues in the room do … obviously there are challenges around the political cycle. We all know that if you’ve got three-year elections, then that bumps into a lot of ongoing funding.\nShe says her colleagues are in the “policy process” stage with meetings every week:\nLey says government’s energy policy is a ‘train wreck’\nLey is asked how she would improve business confidence in Australia. She says she wants to see further domestic and international investment.\nLey goes on:\nOne thing I want to mention is environmental approvals, because we are lagging incredibly badly. For a typical gas project, I think the approval time has blown out to 500 days from 100 days … investors are going somewhere else, or they’re not extending where they are, or they’re downsizing. They’re not putting on those extra workers. So this government has completely taken its eye off the ball.\nShe also describes the government’s energy policy as a “train wreck”.\nLey says she wants to bring Australians ‘with us’ on economic plans\nThe federal opposition leader, Sussan Ley, has concluded her first major economic speech at the Committee for Economic Development of Australia event in Melbourne and is now taking questions from the crowd.\nHer first questions, though, are from the Ceda chief executive, Melinda Cilento, who asks her how she would balance her economic plans with the social compact.\nLey says she wants to “bring Australians with us on this journey”. She goes on:\nIt just seems like a whole lot of numbers and statistics but everyone [including] millennials or gen Z, they understand debt. They’ve got a student debt. They understand household debt when they can’t make that payment by the end of the fortnight.\nThey understand that perhaps they’re never going to be able to scrape up enough money for a deposit on the first home or any home.\nSo we need to frame the conversation so that we tell them that we understand what their lives are like, and we reassure them that the social compact about responsible budget management is about intergenerational equity.\nRight now, every minute, $50,000 is spent on interest on the nation’s debt. And obviously people have got a lot of good ideas, but they all know that putting things on the credit card and then more things on the credit card is not the answer.\nJim Chalmers says Liberals run by ‘weird collection of cookers and crackpots’\nThe treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said earlier the “worst possible” thing for Australia to do would be to walk away from net zero commitments, adding a ding against the Liberal party amid the Coalition’s infighting over the emissions targets:\nThe Liberal party is run now by this weird collection of cookers and crackpots, and nowhere is that more obvious than when it comes to net zero …\nThese Liberals haven’t learned a thing. They haven’t changed a bit, they are as divided and divisive as they have ever been. You see that in their approach to net zero.\nLey says Coalition would undertake an audit of government spending where ‘every dollar would be tested’\nLey is outlining the Coalition’s economic priorities, including reining in spending and accounting for every dollar going out of the government coffers.\nShe says:\nSpending should only grow where it delivers real value, not just because the economy has grown. Every new dollar of spending would require a saving, a re-prioritisation or a reform that makes government leaner …\nEvery dollar would be tested. Is it delivering results? Does it reflect the core responsibilities of government? Can it be done more efficiently or not at all? This is not about mindless cuts, it is about smart choices and hard priorities.\nNews Corp to run Jewish Council ads calling for sanctions on Israel\nDaisy Dumas\nNews Corp says it is inaccurate to say a pro-Palestinian advertisement was pulled from its newspapers and has agreed to publish a progressive Jewish group’s call for sanctions on Israel.\nThe Jewish Council of Australia claimed on Tuesday evening its ads in Wednesday’s Daily Telegraph and Herald Sun had been pulled at the 11th hour after being legally approved and paid for.\nThe quarter-page ads feature the photos of hundreds of Australian Jews to mark the start of a national campaign and a petition calling for sanctions on the Israeli government, a two-way arms embargo and the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador to Australia in response to the atrocities committed in Gaza.\nA News Corp spokesperson said it was inaccurate to say the ads had been pulled and that the delay was due to “normal internal processes”.\nThe JCA said it was told on Wednesday morning an amended version of the ad could run on Thursday with the inclusion of the word “advertisement” in the image.\nSarah Schwartz, the executive officer of the JCA, said:\nOur ad really disrupts the message that all Jews support Israel and the message frequently put forward in News Corp newspapers that any criticism of Israel is antisemitic.\nWe have to keep persevering to have our voices heard in spaces where they otherwise wouldn’t be heard. We can’t give up on News Corp’s readership – this is a human issue."

        "When even Ben & Jerry’s can’t speak out, it’s clear: the era of corporate responsibility is over | Austin Sarat. When the history of this era is written, there will be much to say about the behavior of large corporations. And none of it will be good.\nAs the Trump administration has ramped up its assault on American democracy, many corporations have chosen to look the other way or to curry favor with the president. They have fired employees who were too outspoken in their criticism of Donald Trump – ABC’s suspension of Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night talkshow, after Kimmel’s remarks about Maga’s reaction to the killing of Charlie Kirk, is the latest example.\nOr corporations have muted their brand’s identification with progressive causes.\nOne casualty is Jerry Greenfield, co-founder and namesake of Ben & Jerry’s ice-cream. This week, he resigned from the company.\nHe did so because, he said in a statement, the politically outspoken company had been “silenced”.\nThe consumer goods company Unilever acquired Ben & Jerry’s in 2000, for a reported $326m. At the time, it agreed to respect the company’s independence.\nNo more, according to Greenfield.\n“Standing up for the values of justice, equity, and our shared humanity has never been more important,” Greenfield noted in explaining his resignation. But, he said: “Ben & Jerry’s has been silenced, sidelined for fear of upsetting those in power.”\nBen & Jerry’s crossed swords with Unilever last year when it sued the company for allegedly fighting its calls for a Gaza ceasefire and an end to US military support for Israel.\nThe 2024 suit claimed that Unilever had threatened to dismantle the ice-cream company’s independent board and punish members if Ben & Jerry’s issued a call for a ceasefire. (Unilever said it rejected “the claims made by B&J’s social mission board”. Its motion to dismiss the lawsuit is pending.)\nAnother flare-up occurred in March of this year, when, according to Ben & Jerry’s, Unilever fired its chief executive, David Stever, over his work to advance the company’s “social mission”.\nIf those allegations are true, Unilever would not be alone in trying to avoid offending the Trump administration or its supporters. This is just the latest sign that the era of corporate social and political responsibility is over.\nIce-cream lovers will now have to choose between their taste buds and their consciences.\nCorporate social responsibility (CSR) requires that business leaders recognize, as Harvard Business School explains, that they “have a responsibility to do more than simply maximize profits for shareholders and executives. Rather, they have a social responsibility to do what’s best – not just for their companies, but for people, the planet, and society at large.”\nThe CSR movement really took off about 40 to 50 years ago when businesses realized that they could carve out a niche and attract investment from people who wanted to make money and stay true to their values. Ben & Jerry’s was founded in 1978 during the heyday of CSR, by Greenfield and Ben Cohen.\nIt was upfront about the issues it cared about and the values it sought to promote. The list was long, but it included racial justice, refugee rights, climate, LGBTQ+ rights and democracy.\nThe Association of Corporate-Citizenship Professionals traces the roots of CSR back to the 18th century. At that time, religious groups would not invest, and would urge their members not to invest, in businesses that did not advance their values. Those included the slave trade and businesses that supplied the instruments of war.\nFast forward to the start of the 20th century, when in 1928, the Pioneer Fund became one of the first mutual funds to promote socially responsible investing, which meant avoiding companies producing alcohol or tobacco, or promoting gambling. Almost a century later, the Business Roundtable included in its statement on the purpose of a corporation the following: “We commit to … supporting the communities in which we work. We respect the people in our communities and protect the environment by embracing sustainable practices across our businesses.”\nSome progressives have criticized CSR, describing it as a charade and a public relations tactic that left the profit motive intact and did not require substantial changes in the way companies did business. But Ben & Jerry’s did more than brand itself as interested in social justice and political equality.\nAs its 2024 lawsuit made clear, Ben & Jerry’s has wanted to take political stands even if it meant that it would lose some customers. A year earlier, in March 2023, as Newsweek reports, Cohen “shocked many” by speaking out against the US providing military aid to Ukraine.” (An ally said he opposed Russia’s invasion but wanted a diplomatic solution.)\nWhile from time to time, the company has been accused of not living up to its values, not surprisingly, conservatives have targeted Ben & Jerry’s for being “woke”. Some have tried to organize a boycott to protest what they see as its radical left politics.\nThat’s perhaps why Unilever apparently wanted to pull back Ben & Jerry’s activism.\nWhat we are witnessing now in the way of corporate acquiescence to the rise of authoritarianism is a familiar story. There are plenty of examples.\nTake Viktor Orbán’s Hungary. There, as the political economist Gábor Scheiring argues: “Since 2010 Orbán has been using the momentum created by popular anger at the failures of liberal policies to build up his own system: authoritarian capitalism. A system that is deeply illiberal but capitalist: private property and the profit logic still dominate, but the state bureaucracy and its institutions are subdued to the enrichment of the preferred national economic elite.”\nThere is ample evidence that Trump is succeeding in that same endeavor. That’s why the era of corporate social responsibility is over. Greenfield’s departure is just the latest evidence.\nAustin Sarat, William Nelson Cromwell professor of jurisprudence and political science at Amherst College, is the author or editor of more than 100 books, including Gruesome Spectacles: Botched Executions and America’s Death Penalty\n-",
        "Trump Family Gains Another $5B in Crypto Profits. Critics Call It Corruption.. Did you know that Truthout is a nonprofit and independently funded by readers like you? If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation.\nIn what Public Citizen called “the greatest corruption in presidential history,” U.S. President Donald Trump and his family added $5 billion in cash to their fortunes this Labor Day as his new cryptocurrency was opened to the public market.\nThe currency, known as WLFI, is owned by World Liberty Financial, a company founded by the president’s sons, Donald Trump, Jr., and Eric Trump. A Trump business entity owns 60 percent of the company and is entitled to 75 percent of the revenue from coin sales.\nAs the Wall Street Journal reported Monday:\nGet our free emails\nThe trading debut was most likely the biggest financial success for the president’s family since the inauguration…\nWLFI is likely now the Trumps’ most valuable asset, exceeding their decades-old property portfolio. While the president’s family has continued to pursue property deals around the world since taking office, the fast-moving crypto business has had the biggest early impact.\nCrypto is now the dominant source of Trump’s wealth. As an investigation by the anti-corruption group Accountable.US found last month, “President Trump’s net worth could roughly be $15.9 billion, with about $11.6 billion in uncounted crypto assets,” meaning that the digital currencies now make up 73 percent of his total net worth.\nIn addition to the tokens owned by World Liberty Financial, it found that two Trump-affiliated companies owned 80 percent of the $TRUMP meme coin as of May and had collected over $324 million in fees since Trump took office in January.\nMeanwhile, Trump Media, which owns his online platform Truth Social, bought $2 billion worth of Bitcoin in July and reserved another $300 million in Bitcoin options.\nAs America’s self-proclaimed “first crypto president,” Trump has sought to curb regulations against the volatile financial assets.\nIn July, Trump signed the GENIUS Act, which purports to establish the U.S.’s first regulatory framework for crypto. However, critics noted that the law designated so-called “stablecoins,” of which Trump owns many, as “commodities” rather than “securities,” allowing them to face much looser oversight.\nThough the bill passed with support from over 100 Democrats, Rep. Maxine Waters (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, warned that the bill “legitimizes Trump actively building the most corrupt self-dealing crypto environment this country has ever seen.”\nRep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) described Trump’s latest $5 billion windfall as “blatantly corrupt and a brazen abuse of power.”\n“The current occupant of the White House,” she said, “is putting personal profit above the people, using his power to illegally line the pockets of his family and billionaire friends while hanging everyday families out to dry by ripping away their healthcare, food assistance, raising the cost of consumer goods, gutting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and more.”\nWhile cryptocurrency is often billed as an asset available to everyone that levels the playing field of the finance world, in practice, its ownership is largely concentrated among the wealthiest Americans. According to a Harris poll published in April, nearly half of all crypto owners have a yearly income of over $150,000, putting them in the wealthiest 10% of the country.\n“Your family gets higher energy prices and cuts to healthcare. [Trump’s] family gets billions,” said Rep. Greg Casar (D-Texas), the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. “Corruption, plain and simple.”\nSen. Patty Murray (D-Wash), a strong advocate for crypto regulation, said that such blatant profiting from the presidency makes Trump “easily the most corrupt president in our country’s history,” and emphasized that “Republicans in Congress are not lifting a single finger to exercise basic oversight.”\nAccording to data from OpenSecrets, just three crypto industry-backed political action committees (PACs) poured over $133 million into the 2024 election. Though they spent the majority of that money supporting Republicans, nearly 40 percent of it went to Democrats.\nBut although all this money helped to buy what Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong called \"America's most pro-crypto Congress ever,\" according to Reuters, just 3 percent of legislators in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate own these assets themselves, including Sens. Dave McCormick (R-Pa.) and Tim Sheehy (R-Mon.), as well as Reps. Nick Begich (R-Ark.) and Mike Collins (R-Ga.).\nBut Trump's profiteering far exceeds the crypto holdings of every congressperson put together.\n\"We have only seen the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the damage that this corruption will inflict on the American people,\" said Bartlett Naylor, a financial reform advocate with Public Citizen. \"The impact of attempts by the Trump family and others to buy and sell politics and politicians will continue to ricochet.\"\nKeep the press free. Fight political repression.\nTruthout urgently appeals for your support. Under pressure from an array of McCarthyist anti-speech tactics, independent journalists at Truthout face new and mounting political repression.\nWe rely on your support to publish journalism from the frontlines of political movements.

        "The American system is badly broken | Bernie Sanders. Let’s take a deep breath and, for one moment, forget about Donald Trump, Jimmy Kimmel, the UN, Charlie Kirk, Gaza, a government shutdown and the other crises that we face.\nLet’s talk instead about the reality which the corporate-controlled media and the corporate-controlled political system don’t talk about very much.\nWhat we are witnessing right now is the rise of two Americas. One for the billionaire class. And one for everybody else.\nIn one America, the richest people are becoming obscenely richer and have never, ever had it so good. That America is overflowing with unimaginable wealth, greed and opulence that makes the Gilded Age seem very modest.\nAnd then there is a second America – an America where a majority of people live paycheck to paycheck, struggling to secure the very basic necessities of life – food, healthcare, housing and education.\nThe simple truth is that never before in our history have so few had so much wealth and power while so many live in economic desperation.\nIn the first America, one man – Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, worth more than $480bn, owns more wealth than the bottom 52% of American households. After spending $290m to put Trump back into the White House, Musk has become more than $180bn richer since election day. That’s a pretty good return on his investment.\nBut that’s apparently not good enough for Musk. In order to keep him “motivated” as CEO, Tesla’s board proposed giving him a $1tn pay package if he meets certain goals. A trillion dollars.\nJeff Bezos, the fourth wealthiest person in the world, has a fortune of $233bn. He can sail to Venice on his $500m yacht for his reported $50m wedding, where he gave his wife a $3m-$5m ring – because, among other things, his effective tax rate is just a reported 1.1%.\nMark Zuckerberg, the third richest person in the world, is worth $258bn. He has spent $110m to buy 11 homes in Palo Alto, California, to create his own private compound, and another $270m for more than 2,300 acres in Hawaii with a 5,000 sqft underground bunker and three yachts reportedly worth more than $530m.\nLarry Ellison, the second wealthiest person in the world – worth $377bn – recently became nearly $100bn richer in a single day. He owns a private island in Hawaii and a fleet of jets, and now he’s reportedly trying to buy up major media companies such as Warner Bros and CNN.\nTogether, these four men alone are worth more than $1.3tn. But it’s not just them. The top 1% now owns more wealth than the bottom 93%.\nThe 1% lives in a world completely removed from ordinary Americans. They don’t ride overcrowded subways to get to work or sit in traffic jams to get home. They fly on private jets and helicopters they own. They live in mansions all over the world, send their kids to the most elite private schools and vacation on their own islands. And, for fun, some spend millions to fly off into space on their own rocket ships.\nAnd then there is the other America, where the vast majority of our people live. For them, the economy is not just broken, it is collapsing. In this America, despite a massive increase in worker productivity, real weekly wages for the average American worker are lower today than they were more than 52 years ago.\nIn this America, people are unable to afford a doctor’s visit (if they’re lucky enough to find one); are paying over half of their limited incomes on rent or a mortgage; and are unable to afford the outrageous cost of childcare or send their kids to college. In this America, the price of vegetables, fruit and other healthy foods is beyond the budget for many.\nFor most Americans, the system is not just broken, it is collapsing and is increasingly resembling life in the third world.\nEveryone needs healthcare. Yet today, more than 85 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured – a number that will rise by at least 15 million under Trump’s so-called big, beautiful bill.\nEveryone needs housing. Yet today, nearly 800,000 Americans are homeless and more than 20m households pay more than 50% of their limited incomes on rent or a mortgage. Since 2000, average rents have more than doubled and the median price of a home has soared to more than $435,000.\nEveryone needs a decent education. Yet today, our childcare system is broken and wildly expensive. Many of our public schools are dilapidated with teachers underpaid and underappreciated, and American students are falling behind in math, science and reading compared with their international peers. College education is unaffordable for millions and vocational schools fail to train the workers we desperately need.\nEveryone needs a secure retirement. Yet, nearly half of older workers have no retirement savings and no idea how they will ever retire with any shred of dignity or respect. Meanwhile, 22% of seniors are trying to survive on an income of less than $15,000 a year.\nEnough is enough.\nAs supreme court justice Louis Brandeis said in 1933: “We can have democracy in this country or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of the few, but we cannot have both.”\nThat warning is even more relevant today.\nIn this pivotal moment in American history, we must create a government and an economy that works for all, or we will continue sliding into oligarchy – where the billionaire class controls our government, our economy and our future.\nLet me say to my fellow Americans: I know day-to-day life can take a toll, but we must not allow ourselves to fall into despair. If we do not allow ourselves to be divided up by Trump and his oligarch allies, we can change the path we are on.\nThe choice is clear. Let’s stand together for democracy and justice.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

Annie Ma, Associated Press\nAnnie Ma, Associated Press\nLeave your feedback\nWASHINGTON (AP) — A decade-long slide in high schoolers’ reading and math performance persisted during the COVID-19 pandemic, with 12th graders’ scores dropping to their lowest level in more than 20 years, according to results released Tuesday from an exam known as the nation’s report card.\nEighth-grade students also lost significant ground in science skills, according to the results from the National Assessment of Education Progress.\nREAD MORE: Judge strikes down Education Department guidance against school diversity programs\nThe assessments were the first since the pandemic for eighth graders in science and 12th graders in reading and math. They reflect a downward drift across grade levels and subject areas in previous releases from NAEP, which is considered one of the best gauges of the academic progress of U.S. schools.\n“Scores for our lowest-performing students are at historic lows,” said Matthew Soldner, the acting commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics. “These results should galvanize all of us to take concerted and focused action to accelerate student learning.”\nWhile the pandemic had an outsize impact on student achievement, experts said falling scores are part of a longer arc in education that cannot be attributed solely to COVID-19, school closures and related issues such as heightened absenteeism. Educators said potential underlying factors include children’s increased screen time, shortened attention spans and a decline in reading longer-form writing both in and out of school.\nThe dip in reading scores appeared alongside a shift in how English and language arts are taught in schools, with an emphasis on short texts and book excerpts, said Carol Jago, associate director of the California Reading and Literature Project at UCLA. As a high school English teacher 20 years ago, Jago said it was common for her high school students to read 20 books over the course of a year. Now, some English classes are assigning just three books a year.\n“To be a good reader, you have to have the stamina to stay on the page, even when the going gets tough,” Jago said. “You have to build those muscles, and we’re not building those muscles in kids.”\nEducation Secretary Linda McMahon said the scores show why the Trump administration wants to give states more control of education spending.\nREAD MORE: Trump looks to expand school choice programs by repurposing federal funding\n“Despite spending billions annually on numerous K-12 programs, the achievement gap is widening, and more high school seniors are performing below the basic benchmark in math and reading than ever before,” McMahon said.\nHouse Democrats said the Trump administration’s efforts to dismantle the Education Department will only hurt students.

While NAEP’s definition of “proficient” is a high bar, Muldoon said, it is not an unreasonable one, and it is based on what researchers believe students should be able to achieve by the end of high school.\n“These students are taking their next steps in life with fewer skills and less knowledge in core academics than their predecessors a decade ago,” she said. “This is happening at a time when rapid advancements in technology and society demands more of future workers and citizens, not less.”\nIn reading, the average score in 2024 was the lowest score in the history of the assessment, which began in 1992. Thirty-two percent of high school seniors scored below “basic,” meaning they were not able to find details in a text to help them understand its meaning.\nIn math, the average score in 2024 was the lowest since 2005, when the assessment framework changed significantly. On the test, 45% of high school seniors scored below “basic” achievement, the highest percentage since 2005. Only 33% of high school seniors were considered academically prepared for college-level math courses, a decline from 37% in 2019.\nThe high school reading and math assessments, and the eighth grade science test, are given less frequently than the biannual fourth and eighth grade reading tests, which were last released earlier this year. The new scores reflect tests taken in schools around the country between January and March 2024.\nThe gap between the highest- and lowest-performing students was its widest ever among eighth grade science students, reflecting growing inequality in the American school system.

        "Why the secrecy over consultants' role in school plans?. Education writer James McEnaney details the latest developments in The Herald's investigation of controversial plans for a new school on one of Scotland's largest islands.\nSince early 2025, The Herald has led national coverage of the complex, and continuing, saga over a new school for the Isle of Mull.\nOfficials want to replace the dated Tobermory High School – which includes an integrated nursery and primary school – with modern facilities. Current plans would see the all-through school replicated at a new location on the edge of the town.\nBut campaigners and community leaders have consistently called for a different approach. Rather than a single location, they want to see the secondary school split and built on a standalone site in a more central location. This would allow all young people on Mull to attend high school while living at home – at present, children as young as eleven from the south of the island are sent to board in Oban during the week.\nSurveys of people living on Mull have found that a split site is the preferred choice, and a local family has offered free land for a secondary school in Craignure, a few minutes’ walk from the island’s ferry terminal.\nThe council says that such an approach is unaffordable and undeliverable, although a full cost analysis of the split-site approach has never been released. Its handling of the overall processes around the school has also been heavily criticised by islanders and described as an illustration of “what happens when decisions are made too far away from the people affected.”\nIn October, the matter will be heard at the Court of Session in Edinburgh after a successful appeal for a judicial review of the council’s decision making. If successful, officials are likely to have to restart the process, which the council argues may put the entire project at risk.\nWho else is involved?\nBehind the scenes of the bid for a new school on Mull, a crucial role has been played by an organisation called Hub North, a consultancy organisation which “provides communities with project management services for the building of community projects in North Scotland.”\nHub North was involved in the initial bidding phase of the project, which was combined with submissions from four other local authorities under the title of the North Schools Programme.\nThe consultancy firm has remained involved in subsequent stages of the process. For example, a proposal document from August 2024 shows that a fee of £90,595 (not including VAT or “expenses”) was to be charged for work around community engagement and site selection.\nIn an attempt to understand the full nature of Hub North’s role, particularly with regards to consultation with the people of Mull and the way in which the site selection process was handled, The Herald asked Argyll and Bute Council to release copies of all communication between the two organisations since January 2024. The request was submitted on 14 July 2025.\nOfficials responded on 11 August 2025 advising that the request for information was being rejected in its entirety.\nThe council claimed that the request was “manifestly unreasonable” because it would impose a “significant burden” on the authority. Specifically, officials argue that it would take nearly 200 hours to process the emails held in their systems, of which there are more than 5,500. The cost of processing this is cited at more than £2500.\nEven without this pressure, however, they state that the request would, “in the opinion of a reasonable person, be considered manifestly unreasonable or disproportionate.”\nOfficials go on to accept that there would still be \"a public interest in being transparent and open\" and that the release of the requested information would \"would allow public scrutiny of the decisions it has taken in regard to the new school on Mull.\"\nHowever, they nevertheless find that the public interest in withholding the information outweighs the benefits of its release.\nREAD MORE\nMull campus 'paused' pending outcome of legal case\n-\nCouncil facing court date after Mull campaigners raise £50k\n-\nCouncil chiefs snub MSP-led discussion over school plans\n-\nRather than handling the request under Freedom of Information (FOI) legislation, the council has dealt with it under the rules governing Environmental Information Regulations (EIR) which allow for requests to be dismissed as “manifestly unreasonable”.\nAdvice from the Scottish Information Commissioner states that public bodies “should not use this exception lightly” and that it is designed to deal with the “rare occasions” when individuals do not “exercise their rights to information responsibly.”\nIn subsequent communications, Argyll and Bute Council Executive Director Douglas Hendry stated that the request was treated as an EIR because it “related to the provision of a new school facility on Mull.” However, a significant number of requests for information on the same topic, including some submitted on the same day, have been dealt with under FOI rules.\nIn response to one of these requests, following an initial attempted refusal, the council has provided a small selection of documents regarding the successful application for a Judicial Review of the council’s decision to locate the new Mull school in Tobermory. This disclosure includes communication from Hub North which had been withheld.\nWhat does the email say?\nAt 20:24 on 8 June 2025, Hub North’s Communication and Marketing Manager, Bob Dow, sent an email with the subject line ‘Tobermory Campus’. There were four recipients: the Chief Executive, Operations Director, and a Project Director at Hub North, as well as the Mull Campus Team Project Manager, who has an Argyll & Bute Council email address.\nThe message requests that the council worker, as well as one of the Hub North staff members, analyse a recently published crowd-funder that had been opened by community leaders seeking support for the Judicial Review. The appeal ultimately raised tens of thousands of pounds in just a few days.\nMr Dow asks that the page is checked “line by line” and that a list of “any inaccuracies, misinformation, and misrepresentation” are submitted to him. This, he adds, will allow him to “draft a social media response” in the council’s name to “rebut” any information deemed “incorrect.”\nThe individuals are also asked to “follow the same process” with respect to an article published by the Herald on 6 June 2025, which reported on council chiefs refusing to participate in an MSP-led discussion about the plans for a school on Mull.\nMr Dow states that he plans to “draft a letter of complaint” that will be issued in the name of the council, not Hub North. This, he adds, is in relation to the use of the term “community leaders”, which he says is false because the individuals in question “are a self-appointed protest group.”\nThe Herald understands four of the five members of group were part of a Mull Community Sounding Board established by the council. Two were community councillors, one represented a parent council, and one represented an island community trust\nThe council’s own website says that the Community Sounding Board was “formed of community representatives who are impacted by or have an interest in the proposed new Mull 2-18 Campus.”\nThe email concludes with Mr Dow stating that he has already spoken to the Argyll and Bute Council communication team about “taking a more robust stance” and that this “starts from here.”\nREAD MORE\n'Silenced and belittled' - islanders hit out over new school plans\n-\nAbandoned: students fears over island education let down\n-\nAnalysis: Council backed the status quo instead of the people of Mull\n-\nWhat do the council and the consultants say?\nThe council has already confirmed the contents of Mr Dow’s email on 8 June, but insists that no social media posts or press complaints were drafted. Regarding his ability to direct the actions of a member of staff working for the council, a spokesperson advised that they are in fact an employee of Hub North currently seconded to the council, and rejected suggestions of any improper behaviour.\nThe Herald has asked Argyll and Bute Council to explain why it is \"manifestly unreasonable\" for it to release communications with Hub North regarding the Mull school project, and why the request was treated in a different way to others on the same topic.\nTheir spokesperson responded that the council has already \"explained why this request, which identified potentially 5518 emails, was 'manifestly unreasonable', the language used in the relevant regulations, due to the significant burden on the Council the request would have.\"\nThey added: \"With regard to FOI and EIR requests. The request was dealt with in terms of the Environmental Information Regulations. When you raised this, we confirmed the reasons for this. We also advised that had it been addressed in terms of the Freedom of Information Legislation, then it would have exceeded the costs set out in the fees regulations. In either event the Council was entitled to withhold.\"\nWith regard to Hub North, the spokesperson said: \"They are not a private consultancy, they are a strategic development partner for the public sector focusing on community infrastructure and collaborating with 16 public sector organisations and the Scottish Futures Trust, to deliver projects that enhance local economies and services. Argyll and Bute Council is a shareholder of Hub North Scotland. They are also providing similar services for the four other Councils in the northern region who are part of LEIP3 programme.\"\nHub North did not respond to a request for comment."

        "Why so many mothers with young children are leaving the workforce. A growing share of mothers with young children in America are leaving the workforce, erasing gains made after the COVID-19 pandemic when working remotely became more common. Economics correspondent Paul Solman reports on the impact. Amna Nawaz: A growing share of mothers with young children in America are leaving the work force, erasing gains made after the COVID-19 pandemic, when working remotely became more common. Economics correspondent Paul Solman reports on the impact. Paul Solman: Nicoletta Barbera always saw herself as a working mother. She and husband Stephen (ph) worked for the U.S. Institute of Peace funded by Congress while raising two sons in Washington, D.C., until March. Nicoletta Barbera, Former Senior Program Officer, U.S. Institute of Peace: Overnight and with barely any warning, almost the entirety of the work force of the United States Institute of Peace was laid off kind of en masse. Paul Solman: DOGE-ed, including both Barbera and her husband. Nicoletta Barbera: The rug was really kind of taken out from under us because we not only went from two incomes to zero incomes. We went from having a family health insurance policy for us and our two young children to no health insurance. Paul Solman: Even moms who haven't been asked are leaving their jobs, especially in the back-to-the-office federal government. Misty Heggeness, University of Kansas: Those positions are predominantly held by women and, in particular, women with children, who often are willing to forgo wages in the private sector for more flexible work environments, work environments that historically the federal government has provided. Paul Solman: But now the share of working mothers with children under 5 is falling, says economist Misty Heggeness. Misty Heggeness: We have seen this continual perpetual decline in mothers' labor force participation. The first half of 2025, it shrunk by 3 percentage points. Paul Solman: In the pandemic era, remote flex time schedules helped push women's participation up to a record 78 percent. Once the flexibility vanished, however: Casey Puleo, Former Accountant: It was either going to be my kids or it was going to be my work, and I chose my kids. Paul Solman: Mom of four Casey Puleo juggled her job, accountant for the New York Giants, and kid care when she worked from home. Then: Casey Puleo: My employer was calling for everyone to return to the office. So that was really like the final straw for me. That was like the breaking point where I knew I couldn't do that. Working 9:00 to 6:00 in an office with no days from home, if school was closed, who was going to stay home with my kids? If she had to be picked up because she was sick, I was going to be the one to leave work to go get her. Something had to give. Paul Solman: She's now a stay-at-home mom. Casey Puleo: I felt forced. And in the position I was in, there was no other option. Paul Solman: Same for Jennifer Arenas-Cardenas, who depended on flex time to balance her job as a school psychologist with the needs of 3-year-old twins and a new baby. But last school year: Jennifer Arenas-Cardenas, Former School Psychologist: I was told to come at a certain time, to leave at a certain time, whereas, in years past, as long as I did my job within the hours that I was there, I wasn't really given too much grief over it. Paul Solman: Arenas-Cardenas loved her work, wanted to stay, but, she says: Jennifer Arenas-Cardenas: Trying to manage work expectations, trying to manage home life with twins and a new baby, it just -- it came to a point where it was unmanageable. Paul Solman: Could you not have put the kids in infant care or something like that? Jennifer Arenas-Cardenas: If we were to go that route, then my entire take-home paycheck would be going into their childcare. Paul Solman: And so you just figured, if it's going to be a wash financially, better that you be the parent than somebody else? Jennifer Arenas-Cardenas: Yes, exactly. It's going to eat a up my entire paycheck, then I might as well just stay home with the kids. Paul Solman: Made sense for her family, but it wasn't necessarily better for her clients. Jennifer Arenas-Cardenas: When I was able to do video calls with families or call outside of a typical school schedule, it worked out a lot better for families. I was able to accommodate them and meet them where they were at. Let's say, if a mom got off of work at 5:00, 6:00, I didn't have to make her come to the school at 3:30. I could accommodate my schedule to meet that family with where they were at. Paul Solman: Why do you think your school and other places, of course, eliminated hybrid work, if there was an advantage to the people they were serving? Jennifer Arenas-Cardenas: I think there's this misconception that if you can't see your employees and what they're doing, that they're not doing the job and that you have to be there at a certain time within an office, within a desk, and if you're doing that, you're productive. Paul Solman: There are real costs to the mothers like Arenas-Cardenas who've left or lost their jobs, says economist Heggeness. Misty Heggeness: When you step back from the labor force, it's not only something that affects you today. It is something that ripples throughout your entire lifetime earnings trajectory. Paul Solman: And there are broader effects beyond the mothers themselves. Jennifer Arenas-Cardenas: I'm not contributing to the economy. I'm not receiving a salary. I'm not able to pay taxes, as I have been consistently for the last 20 years of my life. And so, when you're taking that and you're taking many thousands of mothers who are going through this, it's going to create a ripple effect. Paul Solman: Last year, women only earned an average of 81 percent what men did, despite now making up the bulk of the college-educated work force. The motherhood penalty hasn't gone anywhere. Misty Heggeness: What happens is, as soon as they have children, you see women's earnings decrease significantly that first year or so, and then she never recovers. She never gets back onto the trajectory that she was before having children. Nicoletta Barbera: I have applied to over 140 jobs since early April and have not had success yet. Paul Solman: Nicoletta Barbera is technically still part of the labor force, since she's looking for work and technically unemployed. Nicoletta Barbera: I have been told by recruiters or colleagues at other organizations that hundreds and hundreds, if not thousands of people just like me are applying to these jobs. Paul Solman: And it's especially bad being in the D.C. area, rife with federal job cuts. Nicoletta Barbera: I have a lot of pressure and stress and feel a sense of urgency to provide for these children. I'm applying to jobs that are several positions below what I would normally be applying to, maybe even taking a 50 percent pay cut from what I was being paid earlier. But, even so, I'm not having success at finding a job. Paul Solman: Some jobs, she doesn't even apply for. Nicoletta Barbera: Where I assume that I won't be selected for a certain type of position because of my age or the fact that I'm a mother of two young children, I self-select myself out of positions, where maybe a man wouldn't do that. Paul Solman: Arenas-Cardenas chose to leave, but she'd love to be back working her old job. Jennifer Arenas-Cardenas: Even in my hometown here in Arizona, there's multiple school agencies throughout town who are looking for school psychologists. And I'm sure that there's multiple school psychologists just like myself who are kind of in the same boat. Paul Solman: Casey Puleo intends to be a full-time mom for the foreseeable future. Casey Puleo: I thought I would be able to have my flourishing career and be this amazing mom. I wasn't able to do that. Paul Solman: Wasn't able to do it, which figures to have economic repercussions for her and perhaps for us all. For the \"News Hour,\" Paul Solman.",

First, the organization descended into chaos after contestants said Miss USA 2022 was rigged. Then, in 2023, title holders Noelia Voigt and UmaSofia Srivastava relinquished their crowns — a first in the pageants' 72-year history — amid allegations of a toxic workplace environment.
